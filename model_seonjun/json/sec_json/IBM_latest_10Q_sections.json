As a result of this transaction, the company recognized a pension settlement charge of $2.7 billion ($2.0 billion net of tax) in the third quarter of 2024, primarily related to the accelerated recognition of accumulated actuarial losses of the plans. As the charge was non-operating and non-cash, it did not impact our operating (non-GAAP) earnings or cash flow results. Refer to note U, “Retirement-Related Benefits,” in the company's 2024 Annual Report for additional information. \nIn the first quarter of 2025, we made changes to the reported revenue categories within our Software and Consulting reportable segments. These changes did not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements or our reportable segments. The revenue categories are reported on a comparable basis for all periods. Refer to note 3, “Revenue Recognition,” for additional information.\nWithin the tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-period presentation. This is annotated where applicable.\nCurrency\n:\nThe references to “adjusted for currency” or “at constant currency” in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. When we refer to growth rates at constant currency or adjust such growth rates for currency, it is done so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior-year period’s currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. Refer to “Currency Rate Fluctuations” for additional information.\nOperating (non-GAAP) Earnings:\nIn an effort to provide better transparency into the operational results of the business, supplementally, management separates business results into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related charges and intangible asset amortization, expense resulting from basis differences on equity method investments, retirement-related costs and their related tax impacts. Due to the unique, non-recurring nature of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA or U.S. tax reform), management characterizes the one-time provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, and adjustments to that charge as non-operating. Adjustments include the tax effect of true-ups, audit adjustments, accounting elections and new regulations or laws (e.g., H.R. 1 in July of 2025) that impact the TCJA provisions which resulted in the one-time provisional charge. For acquisitions, operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable retention, restructuring and related expenses, tax charges related to acquisition integration and pre-closing charges, such as financing costs. These charges are excluded as they may be inconsistent in amount and timing from period to period and are significantly impacted by the size, type and frequency of our acquisitions. Management also characterized as non-operating expense, given its unique and temporary nature, the impact on the foreign exchange derivative contracts entered into prior to the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG, beginning in December 2023, to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the purchase price of this acquisition. These derivative contracts expired by June 28, 2024. All other spending for acquired companies is included in both earnings from continuing operations and in operating (non-GAAP) earnings. For retirement-related costs, management characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating, consistent with GAAP. We include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit \n50\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\nplan service costs, multi-employer plan costs and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related costs include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan amortization of prior service costs, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements including the impact of a settlement charge of $2.7 billion ($2.0 billion net of tax) resulting from the transfer to an insurer of a portion of the IBM Qualified Personal Pension Plan's defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets in the third quarter of 2024 and pension insolvency costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance, and we consider these costs to be outside of the operational performance of the business.\nOverall, management believes that supplementally providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of our pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows us to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. In addition, these non-GAAP measures provide a perspective consistent with areas of interest we routinely receive from investors and analysts. \nFinancial Results Summary — Three Months Ended September 30:\n(Dollars and shares in millions except per share amounts)\nYr.-to-Yr.\nPercent/\nMargin\nChange\nFor the three months ended September 30:\n2025\n2024\n (1)\nRevenue \n(2)\n$\n16,331 \n$\n14,968 \n9.1 \n%   \nGross profit margin\n57.3 \n%\n56.3 \n%\n1.1 \npts. \nTotal expense and other (income) \n$\n6,931 \n$\n9,222 \n(24.8)\n%   \nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations before income taxes \n$\n2,430 \n$\n(802)\nnm \nProvision for/(benefit from) income taxes from continuing operations\n (3)\n$\n686 \n$\n(485)\nnm \nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations \n$\n1,744 \n$\n(317)\nnm \nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations margin \n10.7 \n%\n(2.1)\n%\n12.8 \npts. \nIncome/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n$\n0 \n$\n(13)\n98.4 \n%   \nNet income/(loss)\n$\n1,744 \n$\n(330)\nnm \nEarnings/(loss) per share from continuing operations - assuming dilution\n$\n1.84 \n$\n(0.34)\nnm \nConsolidated earnings/(loss) per share - assuming dilution\n$\n1.84 \n$\n(0.36)\nnm \nWeighted-average shares outstanding - assuming dilution\n948.9 \n923.6 \n2.7 \n%   \n(1)\n2024 includes the impact of a pension settlement charge of $2.7 billion ($2.0 billion net of tax) resulting in an impact of $2.18 to both diluted earnings/(loss) per share from continuing operations and consolidated diluted earnings/(loss) per share for that period.

While the current economic and trade environment continue to remain dynamic, we expect technology to keep supporting overall economic growth and serve as a key source of competitive advantage allowing businesses to scale, innovate and drive productivity. This was reflected in our performance in the third quarter. Our disciplined strategy and durable business model enable us to create long-term value for our partners and clients. \nIn the first nine months of 2025, movements in global currencies continued to impact our reported year-to-year revenue and profit. We execute hedging programs which defer, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency. The (gains)/losses from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other (income) and expense. Refer to “Currency Rate Fluctuations,” for additional information. \nFinancial Performance Summary — Three Months Ended September 30:\nIn the third quarter of 2025, we reported $16.3 billion in revenue, income from continuing operations of $1.7 billion, and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $2.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.84 as reported and $2.65 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations and $2.4 billion in free cash flow, and delivered shareholder returns of $1.6 billion in dividends. Our third-quarter performance reflects the continued success of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. With our focus on the fundamentals of our business, we continue to maintain a strong liquidity position and solid cash flow generation which enables us to invest in our business and return value to shareholders through dividends.\nTotal revenue grew 9.1 percent as reported and 7.3 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior-year period. Software delivered revenue growth of 10.5 percent as reported (8.8 percent adjusted for currency). Consulting revenue increased 3.3 percent as reported (1.5 percent adjusted for currency). Infrastructure revenue increased 17.0 percent as reported (15.1 percent adjusted for currency), reflecting early strength in our new IBM z17.\nFrom a geographic perspective, Americas revenue increased 9.3 percent as reported and adjusted for currency. Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) increased 14.6 percent as reported (8.7 percent adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific increased 0.1 percent as reported (0.2 percent adjusted for currency).\n52\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\nGross margin of 57.3 percent increased 1.1 points year to year with margin expansion driven primarily by portfolio mix and productivity actions. Operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 58.7 percent increased 1.2 points compared to the prior-year period due to the same dynamics. \nTotal expense and other (income) decreased 24.8 percent in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024 driven by the prior-year pension settlement charge of $2.7 billion and lower workforce rebalancing charges in the current year. This was partially offset by higher operating acquisition-related spending and a prior-year gain from the sale of certain QRadar SaaS assets. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 7.1 percent year to year, driven by higher operating acquisition-related spending and the prior-year gain from the sale of certain QRadar SaaS assets, partially offset by lower workforce rebalancing charges.\nPre-tax income from continuing operations was $2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2025 compared with a pre-tax loss of $0.8 billion in the prior-year period and pre-tax margin was up 20.2 points year to year to 14.9 percent. The continuing operations provision for income taxes was $0.7 billion in the third quarter of 2025, compared to a benefit from income taxes of $0.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Net income from continuing operations of $1.7 billion in the current period compared with a net loss of $0.3 billion in the prior-year period and the net income from continuing operations margin of 10.7 percent was up 12.8 points year to year. The year-to-year performance was primarily driven by the transfer to an insurer of a portion of the Qualified PPP's defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets which resulted in a pension settlement charge of $2.7 billion ($2.0 billion net of tax) in the third quarter of 2024. Our performance in the third quarter also continues to benefit from both revenue growth and gross margin expansion, reflecting the strength of our business model and portfolio.\nOperating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $3.0 billion increased 22.0 percent compared to the third quarter of 2024 and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations increased 2.0 points to 18.6 percent driven by revenue growth, portfolio mix, and increased productivity while providing investment flexibility. The operating (non-GAAP) provision for income taxes was $0.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $0.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Operating (non-GAAP) net income from continuing operations of $2.5 billion increased 16.8 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) net income margin from continuing operations of 15.4 percent increased 1.0 points year to year. \nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.84 in the third quarter of 2025 compared to diluted loss per share of $0.34 in the prior-year period, which included an impact of $2.18 from the pension settlement charge. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $2.65 increased 15.2 percent compared to the third quarter of 2024. In 2024, the operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share calculation used 938.4 million shares, which includes 14.9 million dilutive potential shares under our stock-based compensation plans and contingently issuable shares. Due to the GAAP net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, these dilutive potential shares were excluded from the GAAP loss per share calculation as the effect would have been antidilutive. Refer to note 7, \"Earnings Per Share of Common Stock,\" for additional information.\nCash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of $0.2 billion compared to the third quarter of 2024. Free cash flow was $2.4 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion versus the prior-year period. Net cash used in investing activities of $0.4 billion decreased $1.1 billion and net cash used in financing activities of $3.0 billion increased $0.2 billion compared to the third quarter of 2024.\n53\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\nFinancial Results Summary — Nine Months Ended September 30:\n(Dollars and shares in millions except per share amounts)\nYr.-to-Yr.\nPercent/\nMargin\nChange\nFor the nine months ended September 30:\n2025\n2024 \n(1)\nRevenue \n(2)\n$\n47,849 \n$\n45,199 \n5.9 \n%   \nGross profit margin\n57.2 \n%\n55.6 \n%\n1.6 \npts. \nTotal expense and other (income)\n$\n21,184 \n$\n22,621 \n(6.4)\n%   \nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes \n$\n6,185 \n$\n2,491 \n148.3 \n%   \nProvision for/(benefit from) income taxes from continuing operations\n (3)\n$\n1,193 \n$\n(597)\nnm \nIncome from continuing operations \n$\n4,992 \n$\n3,088 \n61.7 \n%   \nIncome from continuing operations margin \n10.4 \n%\n6.8 \n%\n3.6 \npts. \nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax\n$\n1 \n$\n21 \n(95.0)\n%   \nNet income\n \n$\n4,993 \n$\n3,109 \n60.6 \n%   \nEarnings per share from continuing operations - assuming dilution\n$\n5.27 \n$\n3.30 \n59.7 \n%   \nConsolidated earnings per share - assuming dilution \n$\n5.27 \n$\n3.32 \n58.7 \n%   \nWeighted-average shares outstanding - assuming dilution\n947.4 \n935.4 \n1.3 \n%   \nAt 9/30/2025\nAt 12/31/2024\nAssets\n$\n146,312\n$\n137,175\n6.7 \n%   \nLiabilities\n$\n118,322\n$\n109,783\n7.8 \n%   \nEquity\n$\n27,990\n$\n27,393\n2.2 \n%   \n(1)\n2024 includes a pension settlement charge of $2.7 billion ($2.0 billion net of tax) resulting in an impact of $2.18 to both diluted earnings/(loss) per share from continuing operations and consolidated diluted earnings/(loss) per share.

IBM's Software segment reports revenue and year-to-year revenue percent change for Hybrid Cloud (Red Hat), Automation, Data, and Transaction Processing. The Software segment no longer reports Hybrid Platform & Solutions or Security revenue categories. IBM's Consulting segment reports revenue and year-to-year revenue percent change for Strategy and Technology and Intelligent Operations. These changes did not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements or our reportable segments.\nThe following tables present each reportable segment’s revenue and gross margin results, followed by an analysis of the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 reportable segments results.

This revenue performance reflects sequential acceleration of organic revenue growth and continued contribution from our high-value, annual recurring revenue.\nRevenue performance by line of business in the third quarter compared to the prior-year period was as follows: \nHybrid Cloud (Red Hat) revenue increased 13.7 percent as reported (11.9 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter, as demand for our hybrid cloud solutions remained strong. Our major subscription offerings continued to gain market share, with accelerating growth in both OpenShift and Ansible. Automation revenue grew 23.8 percent as reported (22.2 percent adjusted for currency), driven by strength in our organic portfolio and with HashiCorp contributing to growth, benefiting from IBM's go-to-market distribution. In Data, we had continued strength in our AI portfolio. The revenue performance in Transaction Processing reflects clients' prioritized hardware spending on our new IBM z17.\nAcross Software, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $23.2 billion, which increased 10.7 percent as reported (8.8 percent adjusted for currency). In the first quarter of 2025, the ARR calculation was updated to include all recurring revenue within the Software segment. ARR is a key performance metric management uses to assess the health and growth trajectory of our Software segment, and is calculated by using the current quarter’s recurring revenue and then multiplying that value by four. This value includes the following consumption models: (1) software subscription agreements, including committed term licenses, (2) as-a-service arrangements such as SaaS and PaaS, and (3) maintenance and support contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of software revenue as this performance metric and its inputs may not represent revenue that will be recognized in future periods.\nRevenue performance in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the prior-year period was as follows:\nSoftware revenue of $20,932 million increased 9.2 percent as reported (8.4 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the same period in 2024, driven by double-digit growth in both Hybrid Cloud and Automation and growth at a high single-digit rate in Data. The revenue performance in Transaction Processing reflects our product cycle dynamics. Overall Software revenue performance through the first nine months of 2025 reflects the combination of the strength of our portfolio, the investment we have made in innovating our organic software, and the contribution from acquisitions we have made during the past twelve months, including HashiCorp, StreamSets and webMethods.\n(Dollars in millions)\nYr.-to-Yr.\nPercent/\nMargin\nChange\nFor the three months ended September 30:\n2025\n2024\nSoftware:\n \n \n \nGross profit\n$\n5,989 \n$\n5,431 \n10.3 \n%    \nGross profit margin\n83.1 \n%\n83.2 \n%\n(0.2)\npts.  \nSegment profit\n$\n2,374 \n$\n1,969 \n20.5 \n%    \nSegment profit margin \n32.9 \n%\n30.2 \n%\n2.7 \npts.  \n59\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\n(Dollars in millions)\nYr.-to-Yr.\nPercent/\nMargin\nChange\nFor the nine months ended September 30:\n2025\n2024\nSoftware:\n \n \n \nGross profit\n$\n17,480 \n$\n15,925 \n9.8 \n%    \nGross profit margin\n83.5 \n%\n83.1 \n%\n0.4 \npts. \nSegment profit\n$\n6,517 \n$\n5,582 \n16.8 \n%    \nSegment profit margin\n31.1 \n%\n29.1 \n%\n2.0 \npts. \nSoftware gross profit margin decreased 0.2 points to 83.1 percent in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the prior-year period.

Strategy and Technology revenue increased 1.7 percent as reported (flat adjusted for currency) and Intelligent Operations revenue increased 5.3 percent as reported (3.6 percent adjusted for currency). The overall growth in Consulting reflects the solid demand for our strategic offerings, including business application transformation, application migration and modernization, and application operations as clients focus their investments on solutions that accelerate AI transformation and maximize their returns on those investments.\nFor the first nine months of 2025, Consulting revenue of $15,706 million increased 1.2 percent as reported (flat adjusted for currency), compared to the prior-year period, reflecting continued client focus on accelerating AI transformations and scaling technology platforms to drive operational efficiency and prioritize their spending on investments that provide a maximum return. In the first nine months of 2025, Intelligent Operations grew 2.8 percent as reported (2.0 percent adjusted for currency), partially offset by Strategy and Technology, which was flat as reported and declined 1.2 percent adjusted for currency.

However, the quality of our signings continued to strengthen, with more strategic signings with new clients and expanded engagements with existing clients. Our book-to-bill ratio for the trailing twelve-months was approximately 1.12. Book-to-bill represents the ratio of IBM Consulting signings to its revenue over the same period. The metric is a useful indicator of the demand of our business over time.\n61\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\nSignings are management’s initial estimate of the value of a client’s commitment under a services contract within IBM Consulting. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs.\nContract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Total signings can vary over time due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the timing of signing a small number of larger contracts. Signings associated with an acquisition will be recognized on a prospective basis.\nManagement believes the estimated values of signings disclosed provide an indication of our forward-looking revenue. Signings are used to monitor the performance of the business and viewed as useful information for management and shareholders. The conversion of signings into revenue may vary based on the types of services and solutions, contract duration, customer decisions, and other factors, which may include, but are not limited to, the macroeconomic environment.\nInfrastructure\n(Dollars in millions)\nYr.-to-Yr.\nPercent\nChange\nYr.-to-Yr.\nPercent\nChange\nAdjusted For\nCurrency\nFor the three months ended September 30:\n2025\n2024\nInfrastructure revenue:\n$\n3,559 \n$\n3,042 \n17.0 \n%\n15.1 \n%\nHybrid Infrastructure\n$\n2,263 \n$\n1,765 \n28.2 \n%\n26.3 \n%\nIBM Z\n61.1 \n59.0 \nDistributed Infrastructure\n9.8 \n8.0 \nInfrastructure Support\n1,296 \n1,277 \n1.5 \n(0.3)\n(Dollars in millions)\nYr.-to-Yr.\nPercent\nChange\nYr.-to-Yr.\nPercent\nChange\nAdjusted For\nCurrency\nFor the nine months ended September 30:\n2025\n2024\nInfrastructure revenue:\n$\n10,586 \n$\n9,764 \n8.4 \n%\n7.7 \n%\nHybrid Infrastructure\n$\n6,775 \n$\n5,928 \n14.3 \n%\n13.2 \n%\nIBM Z\n43.5 \n41.9 \nDistributed Infrastructure\n(4.2)\n(5.0)\nInfrastructure Support\n3,811 \n3,835 \n(0.6)\n(0.8)\nInfrastructure revenue of $3,559 million increased 17.0 percent as reported and 15.1 percent adjusted for currency in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the prior-year period.

Total cost for the first nine months of 2025 decreased by $2,946 million compared to the first nine months of 2024, primarily driven by a decrease in curtailments/settlements ($2,723 million) due to a pension settlement charge in the prior year, a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($291 million) and lower interest cost ($180 million), partially offset by lower expected return on plan assets ($267 million).\nAs described in the “Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings” section, management characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the third quarter of 2025 were $253 million, a decrease of $4 million compared to the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by lower service cost ($9 million), partially offset by increased cost of defined contribution plans ($5 million). For the first nine months of 2025, operating retirement-related costs were $751 million, a decrease of $16 million compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower service cost ($30 million), partially offset by increased cost of defined contribution plans ($14 million). Non-operating costs were $13 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $2,797 million in the prior-year period, and $61 million for the first nine months of 2025 compared to $2,991 million in the prior-year period. For the periods presented, the year-to-year decreases in non-operating costs were primarily driven by the prior year pension settlement charge, resulting from the transfer to an insurer of a portion of the Qualified PPP, and a related decrease in recognized actuarial losses and interest cost, partially offset by a decrease in expected return on plan assets. Refer to note U, “Retirement-Related Benefits,” in our 2024 Annual Report for additional information.\nTaxes\nOn July 4, 2025, H.R. 1, a bill to provide for reconciliation, was signed into law in the United States as Public Law 119-21 (the Act or H.R. 1). The Act incorporates various business tax provisions, including the permanent extension of key measures from the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As a result, the company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge to income tax expense of approximately $300 million in the Consolidated Income Statement in the third quarter of 2025, primarily for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. This one-time, non-cash charge did not impact operating (non-GAAP) net income or operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share.\nThe continuing operations provision for income taxes was $686 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to a benefit from income taxes of $485 million in the third quarter of 2024. The current-year tax provision includes a charge resulting from the Act, as described above. The prior-year tax benefit was primarily driven by the pension settlement charge. The operating (non-GAAP) provision for income taxes was $516 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to \n71\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\n$332 million in the third quarter of 2024. \nThe continuing operations provision for income taxes for the first nine months of 2025 was $1,193 million, compared to a benefit from income taxes of $597 million for the first nine months of 2024. The provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2025 includes a charge resulting from the Act, as described above. The benefit from income taxes in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by the pension settlement charge in the third quarter and the resolution of certain tax audit matters in the first quarter. The operating (non-GAAP) provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2025 was $1,282 million, compared to $942 million in the first nine months of 2024. The operating (non-GAAP) income tax provision year-to-year change was primarily driven by the resolution of certain tax audit matters in the first quarter of 2024.\nIBM’s tax provision and effective tax rate are impacted by recurring factors including the geographical mix of income before taxes, incentives, specific transactions, changes in unrecognized tax benefits and discrete tax events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in or new interpretations of tax laws. The GAAP tax provision and effective tax rate could also be affected by adjustments to the previously recorded charges for U.S. tax reform attributable to any changes in law, new regulations and guidance, and audit adjustments, among others.\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed adjustments related to certain cross-border transactions with respect to the company’s 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 U.S. income tax returns, which if sustained, would increase the company’s income subject to tax by approximately $4.2 billion for the 2013-2014 audit cycle and approximately $1.2 billion for the 2015-2016 audit cycle, with tax calculated at the relevant federal income tax rate. The company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions, filed IRS Appeals protests, and will pursue resolution at court, if necessary. In 2021, the IRS commenced its audit of the company’s U.S. tax returns for 2017-2018, which the company anticipates will be completed in 2025. With respect to major U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions, the company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2016. The company is no longer subject to income tax examination of its U.S. federal tax return for years prior to 2013. The open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions, and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years.\nThe company is involved in a number of income tax-related matters in India challenging tax assessments issued by the India Tax Authorities. As of September 30, 2025, the company had recorded approximately $430 million as prepaid income taxes in India. A significant portion of this balance represents cash tax deposits paid over time to protect the company’s right to appeal various income tax assessments made by the India Tax Authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years.\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2025 is $9,325 million which can be reduced by $681 million associated with timing adjustments, potential transfer pricing adjustments, and state income taxes. The net amount of $8,644 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the company’s effective tax rate.\n72\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\nFinancial Position\nDynamics\nOur balance sheet at September 30, 2025 continues to provide us with financial flexibility to support and invest in the business.\nCash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities at September 30, 2025 were $14,885 million, an increase of $81 million compared to December 31, 2024. Total debt of $63,115 million at September 30, 2025 increased $8,142 million compared to December 31, 2024, primarily driven by the first-quarter 2025 debt issuances to increase our financial liquidity and plan for our future debt maturities. We continue to manage our debt levels while being acquisitive and without sacrificing investments in our business. \nIn the first nine months of 2025, we generated $9,153 million in cash from operating activities, an increase of $37 million compared to the first nine months of 2024. Within cash from operating activities, cash provided by financing receivables decreased $919 million compared to the prior year. Our free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $7,181 million, an increase of $595 million versus the prior-year period. Refer to pages \n77\n through \n78\n for additional information on free cash flow. We invested $7,903 million in acquisitions primarily for the acquisition of HashiCorp, which was completed in the first quarter, and we returned $4,681 million to shareholders through dividends in the first nine months of 2025. \nOur pension plans were well funded at the end of 2024, with worldwide qualified plans funded at 116 percent. Overall pension funded status as of the end of September 2025 was fairly consistent with year-end 2024.

Current liabilities increased $2,000 million ($762 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to increases in short-term debt driven by reclassifications from long-term debt net of maturities.\nReceivables and Allowances\nRoll Forward of Total IBM Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses\n(Dollars in millions)\nJanuary 1, 2025\nAdditions / (Releases) \n(1)\nWrite-offs \n(2)\nForeign currency and other\nSeptember 30, 2025\n$273\n$25\n$(39)\n$26\n$285\n(1)\nAdditions/(Releases) for allowance for credit losses are recorded in expense.\n(2)\nRefer to note A, “Significant Accounting Policies,” in our 2024 Annual Report for additional information regarding allowance for credit loss write-offs.\nExcluding receivables classified as held for sale, the total IBM receivables provision coverage was 1.5 percent at September 30, 2025, an increase of 10 basis points compared to December 31, 2024. The increase in coverage is primarily driven by a decrease in total receivables. The majority of the write-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were related to receivables which had been previously reserved.

Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables, and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable. The Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9.0 to 1 at September 30, 2025.\nI\nnterest expense relating to debt supporting Financing’s external client and internal business is included in the “Financing Results of Operations” and in note 4, “Segments.” In the Consolidated Income Statement, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Financing’s internal financing to the company is classified as interest expense.\n74\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\nEquity\nTotal equity increased $597 million from December 31, 2024, primarily driven by net income of $4,993 million and an increase in common stock of $1,439 million; partially offset by dividends paid of $4,681 million and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $715 million driven by net unrealized losses from cash flow hedges. \nCash Flow\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page \n7\n, are summarized in the table below. These amounts also include the cash flows associated with the Financing business.\n(Dollars in millions)\nFor the nine months ended September 30:\n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by/(used in):\n \n \nOperating activities\n$\n9,153 \n$\n9,115 \nInvesting activities\n(11,719)\n(3,558)\nFinancing activities\n(423)\n(5,403)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n429 \n(29)\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(2,561)\n$\n125 \nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $37 million as compared to the first nine months of 2024. This was due to an increase in performance-related improvements within net income; partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by financing receivables and from balance sheet dynamics. Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions/divestitures in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows also includes a one-time, non-cash income tax charge associated with the enactment of H.R. 1 in July of 2025, and the tax benefit associated with the pension settlement charge in the third quarter of 2024, each of which represents a non-cash adjustment to reconcile net income/(loss) to cash from operating activities.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $8,161 million primarily driven by the HashiCorp acquisition, higher net purchases of marketable securities and other investments, a decrease in cash provided by divestitures driven by the first-quarter 2024 sale of The Weather Company assets, and higher net capital expenditures as the prior year was reduced by the cash proceeds from the sale of certain QRadar SaaS assets.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $4,980 million mainly due to a decrease in cash used for debt maturities and higher cash proceeds from new debt issuances in the current \nperiod.\nLooking Forward\nTechnology remains a key driver of growth and competitive advantage which allows businesses to scale, drive cost efficiencies, productivity and transformation. It is clear that technology is playing a significant role as the value of hybrid cloud, automation, data sovereignty, and on-prem solutions becomes even more critical in today’s environment. \nAI adoption is accelerating, and hybrid cloud remains the foundation of enterprise IT. The portfolio of AI offerings we have built, including cost efficient, fit-for-purpose open-source models deployed in hybrid environments, is focused on helping businesses scale AI and generate return through productivity improvements and automation. In Software, IBM watsonx provides a robust portfolio of AI products for developing AI apps, managing data, and governing the entire lifecycle of AI models and AI agents. Our watsonx platform and watsonx Orchestrate help enterprises deploy AI by connecting agents, models, and workflows with governance and security. We continue to see Infrastructure play a larger role, enabling hybrid cloud environments for mission-critical transactions and AI workloads, as clients bring AI to their data. In June, we launched the IBM z17, which delivers enhanced AI acceleration through multi-model AI capabilities. In July, we introduced IBM Power11 which delivers the performance, resiliency, and scalability needed to run mission-critical data-intensive workloads. In Consulting, our experts are helping clients design and execute AI strategies by leveraging the IBM Consulting Advantage platform, an AI delivery platform designed to implement solutions at scale, transforming how our consultants work and harnessing AI across every stage of the project lifecycle.\n75\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\nAI is also a powerful productivity driver for our clients and for IBM. We are transforming our enterprise operations, driving efficiency and cost savings, by leveraging technology and embedding AI in our own workflows, as well as optimizing our supply chain and service delivery. Beginning in the second-quarter 2025, we further optimized our supply chain by shifting our Distributed Infrastructure manufacturing to an industry standard strategic partner. This is the next evolution of our supply transformation as we pivoted to a simpler, more efficient process.   \n \nWe remain focused on accelerating innovation speed and impact, and we continue to invest in emerging technologies, including Quantum, bringing new innovations to market. To complement our portfolio, we completed six acquisitions in the first nine months of 2025, including the acquisition of HashiCorp in the first quarter, which brought leading automation and security tools that integrate with our hybrid cloud.\nOur performance over the first nine months of 2025 reflects the continued success of our focused strategy around hybrid cloud and AI and underscores the strength and diversity of our business model and portfolio. We remain focused on consistent execution, delivering long-term growth aligned with our financial model.\nWhile the operating environment continues to remain dynamic, we believe our focused portfolio, disciplined investments in innovation, diverse set of businesses and clients, relentless focus on productivity, and strong liquidity position drive the durability of our performance.\nRetirement-Related Plans\nOur pension plans are well funded. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion in 2025, essentially flat compared to 2024, of which $0.1 billion generally relates to legally required contributions to non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans. We expect 2025 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $1.1 billion. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2024. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.0 billion in 2025, essentially flat compared to 2024. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $0.1 billion, a decrease of approximately $3.3 billion compared to 2024, primarily driven by the $3.1 billion of pension settlement charges resulting from the U.S. and Canada pension transfers in the second half of 2024, and lower recognized actuarial losses. Refer to note U, “Retirement-Related Benefits,” in our 2024 Annual Report for additional information.\nCurrency Rate Fluctuations\nChanges in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect our financial results and financial position. Movements in currency, and the fact that we do not hedge 100 percent of our currency exposures, will result in a currency impact to our revenues, profit and cash flows throughout 2025. We execute a hedging program which defers, versus eliminates, the volatility of currency impacts on our financial results. During periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates over time. \nReferences to “adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant currency methodology that we utilize to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Based on the currency rate movements in the third quarter of 2025, revenue from continuing operations increased 9.1 percent as reported and 7.3 percent at constant currency compared to the prior year. In the first nine months of 2025, revenue from continuing operations increased 5.9 percent as reported and 5.0 percent at constant currency, compared to the same period in 2024.\nAt September 30, 2025, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in most local currencies being translated into more dollars than at year-end 2024. We use financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to foreign currency-based transactions.\nWe translate revenue, cost and expense in our non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. In the third quarter of 2025 and first nine months of 2025, the impact from currency translation and hedging to year-to-year pre-tax income, operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income and segments profit margin growth was immaterial. Hedging and certain underlying foreign currency transaction gains and losses are allocated to our segment results. Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period.\n76\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\nFor non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations. Generally, we manage currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to \nU.S. dollars.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn our 2024 Annual Report, on pages 34 to 37, there is a discussion of our liquidity including two tables that present three years of data. The table presented on page 34 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities, and the size of our global credit facilities for each of the past three years. For the nine months ended, or at, as applicable, September 30, 2025, those amounts are $9.2 billion of net cash from operating activities, $14.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities and $10.0 billion in global credit facilities, respectively. While we have no current plans to draw on these credit facilities, they are available as back-up liquidity. \nThe major rating agencies' ratings on our debt securities at September 30, 2025 appear in the following table and remain unchanged from June 30, 2025.\nIBM Ratings:\nStandard\nand Poor's\nMoody’s\nInvestors\nService\nFitch\nRatings\nSenior long-term debt\nA-\nA3\nA-\nCommercial paper\nA-2\nPrime-2\nF1\nWe have financial flexibility, supported by our strong liquidity position and cash flows, to operate at a single A credit rating. Debt levels have increased $8.1 billion ($6.2 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2024 driven by debt issuances; partially offset by maturities. In the first quarter of 2025, we issued $8.4 billion of debt for general corporate purposes, including our future debt maturity obligations, as well as capital allocation priorities. Refer to note 12, “Borrowings,” for additional information.\nWe do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our debt covenants are well within the required levels. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if our credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At September 30, 2025, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $608 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of our outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.\nWe prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page \n7\n of this Form 10-Q and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page \n75\n. For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different manner.\nManagement uses \nfree cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, strategic investments, plan shareholder return levels and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software and other asset sales. A key objective of the Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and our Financing receivables are the basis for that growth. Accordingly, management considers Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Financing receivables.\n77\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\nThe following is \nmanagement’s view of cash flows for the first nine months of 2025 and 2024 prepared in a manner consistent with the description above.\n(Dollars in millions)\nFor the nine months ended September 30:\n2025\n2024\nNet cash from operating activities per GAAP\n$\n9,153 \n$\n9,115 \nLess: change in Financing receivables\n905 \n1,824 \nNet cash from operating activities, excluding Financing receivables\n$\n8,248 \n$\n7,292 \nCapital expenditures, net \n(1,067)\n(705)\nFree cash flow \n$\n7,181 \n$\n6,586 \nChange in Financing receivables \n(1)\n905 \n1,824 \nAcquisitions\n(7,903)\n(2,748)\nDivestitures\n(1)\n705 \nDividends\n(4,681)\n(4,601)\nChange in total debt \n(1)\n4,683 \n(777)\nOther \n(1)\n(531)\n(704)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash \n(1)\n429 \n(29)\nChange in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities\n$\n81 \n$\n257 \n(1)\nPrior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the change in 2025 presentation.\nIn the first nine months of 2025, we generated $7.2 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.6 billion versus the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by performance-related improvements within net income; partially offset by higher net capital expenditures as the prior year was reduced by the cash proceeds from the sale of certain QRadar SaaS assets, and working capital dynamics. In the first nine months of 2025, we invested $7.9 billion in acquisitions, including the acquisition of HashiCorp, and we continued to return value to shareholders with $4.7 billion in dividends.\nEvents that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed previously and in our 2024 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation, future pension funding requirements, periods of severe downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in note 14, “Contingencies,” in this Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, we expect to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. defined benefit plans of approximately $100 million in 2025. Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion in 2025. Refer to “Retirement-Related Plans” for additional information. Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status. We are not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or changes in pension plan funding regulations. In 2025, we are not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans.\nOur cash flows are sufficient to fund our current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. When additional requirements arise, we have several liquidity options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates and utilizing our committed global credit facilities. Our overall shareholder payout remains at a comfortable level and we remain fully committed to our \nlong-standing \ndividend policy.\n78\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\nF\ninancing\nFinancing is a reportable segment that facilitates IBM clients’ acquisition of hardware, software and services by providing financing solutions, while generating solid returns on equity.\nResults of Operations\n(Dollars in millions)\nYr.-to-Yr.\nPercent\nChange/Margin Change \nYr.-to-Yr. \nPercent\nChange\nAdjusted For\nCurrency\nFor the three months ended September 30:\n2025\n2024\nRevenue \n$\n200 \n$\n181 \n10.4 \n%   \n8.5 \n%\nSegment profit\n$\n123 \n$\n86 \n43.2 \n%   \nSegment profit margin \n \n \n61.6 \n%\n47.5 \n%\n14.1 \npts. \n(Dollars in millions)\nYr.-to-Yr.\nPercent\nChange/Margin Change \nYr.-to-Yr. \nPercent\nChange\nAdjusted For\nCurrency\nFor the nine months ended September 30:\n2025\n2024\nRevenue\n$\n557 \n$\n543 \n2.7 \n%   \n2.6 \n%\nSegment profit\n$\n371 \n$\n254 \n45.8 \n%   \nSegment profit margin\n \n66.5 \n%\n46.9 \n%\n19.7 \npts. \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, financing revenue increased 10.4 percent as reported (8.5 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior-year period.

Due to the GAAP net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, these dilutive potential shares were excluded from the GAAP loss per share calculation as the effect would have been antidilutive. The difference in share count resulted in an additional $(0.04) reconciling item. \n81\nTable of Contents\nManagement Discussion – (continued)\n(Dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nGAAP\nAcquisition-\nRelated\nAdjustments\nRetirement-\nRelated\nAdjustments\nU.S. Tax Reform\nImpacts \n(1)\nOperating\n(non-GAAP)\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025:\nGross profit\n$\n27,369 \n$\n657 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n28,025 \nGross profit margin\n57.2 \n%\n1.4 \npts. \n— \npts. \n— \npts. \n58.6 \n%\nSG&A\n$\n14,661 \n$\n(1,055)\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n13,606 \nR&D\n$\n6,129 \n$\n(4)\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n6,125 \nOther (income) and expense\n$\n(376)\n$\n(7)\n$\n(61)\n$\n— \n$\n(444)\nTotal expense and other (income) \n$\n21,184 \n$\n(1,066)\n$\n(61)\n$\n— \n$\n20,058 \nPre-tax income from continuing operations\n$\n6,185 \n$\n1,723 \n$\n61 \n$\n— \n$\n7,968 \nPre-tax margin from continuing operations\n12.9 \n%\n3.6 \npts. \n0.1 \npts. \n— \npts. \n16.7 \n%\nProvision for/(benefit from) income taxes \n(2)\n$\n1,193 \n$\n396 \n$\n0 \n$\n(307)\n$\n1,282 \nEffective tax rate\n19.3 \n%\n0.8 \npts. \n(0.2)\npts. \n(3.9)\npts. \n16.1 \n%\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n4,992 \n$\n1,326 \n$\n61 \n$\n307 \n$\n6,686 \nIncome margin from continuing operations\n10.4 \n%\n2.8 \npts. \n0.1 \npts. \n0.6 \npts. \n14.0 \n%\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations \n$\n5.27 \n$\n1.40 \n$\n0.06 \n$\n0.32 \n$\n7.06 \n(Dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nGAAP\nAcquisition-\nRelated\nAdjustments\nRetirement-\nRelated\nAdjustments\n (3)\nU.S. Tax Reform\nImpacts \n(1)\nOperating\n(non-GAAP) \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n \n \n \nGross profit\n$\n25,112 \n$\n533 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n25,645 \nGross profit margin\n55.6 \n%\n1.2 \npts.\n— \npts. \n— \npts. \n56.7 \n%\nSG&A\n$\n14,823 \n$\n(854)\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n13,969 \nOther (income) and expense \n(4)\n$\n1,694 \n$\n(68)\n$\n(2,991)\n$\n— \n$\n(1,364)\nTotal expense and other (income)\n$\n22,621 \n$\n(922)\n$\n(2,991)\n$\n— \n$\n18,709 \nPre-tax income from continuing operations\n$\n2,491 \n$\n1,454 \n$\n2,991 \n$\n— \n$\n6,936 \nPre-tax margin from continuing operations\n5.5 \n%\n3.2 \npts. \n6.6 \npts. \n— \npts. \n15.3 \n%\nProvision for/(benefit from) income taxes \n(2)\n$\n(597)\n$\n374 \n$\n731 \n$\n434 \n$\n942 \nEffective tax rate\n(24.0)\n%\n10.4 \npts. \n20.9 \npts. \n6.3 \npts. \n13.6 \n%\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n3,088 \n$\n1,081 \n$\n2,259 \n$\n(434)\n$\n5,994 \nIncome margin from continuing operations\n6.8 \n%\n2.4 \npts. \n5.0 \npts. \n(1.0)\npts. \n13.3 \n%\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations\n$\n3.30 \n$\n1.16 \n$\n2.42 \n$\n(0.46)\n$\n6.41 \n(1)\n2025 includes a one-time, non-cash income tax charge associated with the enactment of H.R. 1 in July of 2025. 2024 includes a benefit from income taxes due to the resolution of certain tax audit matters in the first quarter.
