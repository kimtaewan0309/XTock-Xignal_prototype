Apollo conducts its business primarily in the United States through the following three reportable segments: Asset Management, Retirement Services and Principal Investing. These business segments are differentiated based on the investment services they provide as well as varying investing strategies.\nOur Businesses\nAsset Management\nOur Asset Management segment focuses on credit and equity investing strategies. These strategies reflect the range of investment capabilities across our platform based on relative risk and return. As an asset manager, we earn fees for providing investment management services and expertise to our client base. The amount of fees charged for managing these assets depends on the underlying investment strategy, liquidity profile, and, ultimately our ability to generate returns for our clients. We also earn capital solutions fees as part of our growing capital solutions business and as part of monitoring and deployment activity alongside our sizable private equity franchise. After expenses, we call the resulting earning stream “Fee Related Earnings” or “FRE”, which represents the primary performance measure for the Asset Management segment. As of December 31, 2024, we had total AUM of $751.0 billion. \nOur Asset Management segment had a team of 3,125 employees as of December 31, 2024, with offices throughout the world. This team possesses a broad range of transaction, financial, managerial and investment skills. We operate our asset management business in a highly integrated manner, which we believe distinguishes us from other alternative asset managers. Our investment teams frequently collaborate across disciplines and we believe that this collaboration enables our clients to more successfully invest across a company’s capital structure. Our objective is to achieve superior long-term risk-adjusted returns for our clients. The majority of the investment funds we manage are designed to invest capital over a period of several years from inception, thereby allowing us to seek to generate attractive long-term returns throughout economic cycles. We have a contrarian, value-oriented investment approach, emphasizing downside protection, and the preservation of capital. We believe our contrarian investment approach is reflected in a number of ways, including:\n•\nour willingness to pursue investments in industries that our competitors typically avoid;\n•\nthe often complex structures employed in some of the investments of our funds;\n•\nour experience investing during periods of uncertainty or distress in the economy or financial markets; and\n•\nour willingness to undertake transactions that have substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe have applied this investment philosophy to identify what we believe are attractive investment opportunities, deploy capital across the balance sheet of industry leading, or “franchise,” businesses and create value throughout economic cycles.\nCredit\nCredit is our largest asset management strategy with $616.4 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2024. Our credit strategy spans third-party strategies and Apollo’s retirement services business across four main investment pillars: direct origination, asset-backed finance, opportunistic credit and multi-credit. Our credit strategy focuses on generating excess returns through high-quality credit underwriting and origination. Beyond participation in the traditional issuance and secondary credit markets, through our origination platforms and corporate solutions capabilities we seek to originate attractive and safe-yielding assets for the investors in the funds we manage. The investment portfolios of the credit-oriented funds Apollo manages include several asset classes, as described below:\n•\nDirect Origination \n($251.3 billion of AUM), includes large corporate direct origination, middle-market direct lending, and investment grade and performing credit mandates across managed accounts and CLOs. Apollo’s direct origination platform is built to offer companies a variety of financing solutions across investment grade and below investment grade, and public and private markets. The strategy is focused on first lien senior secured investments and is diversified across fixed and floating rate issuance, issuer type and sector; \n•\nAsset-Backed Finance\n ($229.1 billion of AUM), includes instruments that are supported first by the contractual cash flows of a pool of assets, and second by the liquidation value of those assets. Asset-backed finance encompasses diverse credit types, such as mortgages, consumer credit, receivables, aircraft lending, and inventory finance, in both whole loan and bond format across the capital structure;\n•\nOpportunistic Credit \n($40.3 billion of AUM), seeks to optimize both near- and longer-term relative value across market cycles by capitalizing on investment opportunities across the credit spectrum, spanning private and public markets as well as corporate and asset-backed credit. Using a flexible approach, the objective of the opportunistic credit strategy is to identify market inefficiencies and unique opportunities to generate excess returns; and\n•\nMulti-Credit \n($25.2 billion of AUM), targets investment grade and high yield performing credit, including income-oriented, senior loan and bond corporate credit as well as asset-backed finance investments. The multi-credit strategy allocates capital across both public and private markets, seeking to generate enhanced yield and attractive risk-adjusted returns while prioritizing downside protection.\nEquity\nOur equity strategy represents $134.7 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2024. Across our equity strategy, we focus on creative structuring and sourcing while working with the management teams of the portfolio companies of Apollo managed funds to help transform and grow their businesses. Our flexible mandate and purchase price discipline allow us to embrace complexity and seek attractive outcomes for our stakeholders. Apollo’s equity team has experience across sectors, industries, and geographies spanning its private equity, hybrid value, secondaries equity, AAA, real estate equity, impact investing, infrastructure and clean transition equity strategies. We have consistently produced attractive long-term investment returns in the traditional private equity funds we manage, generating a 39% gross IRR and a 24% net IRR on a compound annual basis from inception through December 31, 2024. Our equity strategy focuses on several investing strategies as described below:\n•\nCorporate Private Equity \n($76.8 billion of AUM)\n, \nwhich refers to our investment strategy focused on creating investment opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns across industries and geographies and throughout market cycles, utilizing our value-oriented investment approach. Through this strategy, we seek to build portfolios of investments that are created at meaningful discounts to comparable market multiples, thereby resulting in what we believe are portfolios focused on capital preservation. The transactions in this strategy include opportunistic buyouts, corporate carveouts and deleveraging investments. Corporate Private Equity also includes our secondaries equity (“Secondaries”) and impact investing (“Impact”) strategies. Secondaries offers a comprehensive set of secondary and liquidity solutions while Impact pursues private equity-like opportunities that aim to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns while also generating positive, measurable social and/or environmental impact;\n•\nHybrid Value\n ($14.7 billion of AUM), which refers to our strategy that focuses on investments that share features with both private credit and traditional private equity investments. Hybrid Value offers creative, partnership-driven \n13\nTable of Contents\nsolutions to counterparties seeking to fund growth initiatives, acquisitions, liquidity events for shareholders and balance sheet deleveraging. By employing a comprehensive and flexible investment approach, the hybrid value strategy aims to generate equity-like returns with credit-like downside protection across market cycles;\n•\nAAA \n($19.5 billion of AUM), which offers investors access to Apollo’s flagship private market strategy in a perpetual capital, semi-liquid structure. The strategy seeks to deliver equity-like returns with lower risk and more downside protection than both public equity and traditional private equity buyout strategies. AAA’s portfolio encompasses several investment strategies, such as core private equity, structured equity, traditional private equity, private credit, secondaries, and real assets;\n•\nReal Estate Equity\n ($16.6 billion of AUM), which refers to our real estate income strategies encompassing core plus and net lease investments in the non-traded REIT and public and private real estate funds we manage, as well as our value add and opportunistic investments strategies that target investments in real estate assets, portfolios and platforms in regionally focused private funds in both the United States and Asia; and\n•\nInfrastructure Equity\n ($13.6 billion of AUM), which refers to the investment strategy of certain funds managed by Apollo that focus on investing in a broad range of infrastructure assets, including digital infrastructure, energy transition, transportation/logistics, and sustainable living. Infrastructure Equity also includes the legacy natural resources private equity funds we manage, as well as our clean transition equity strategy, which is our dedicated energy transition and decarbonization-focused private equity strategy that invests in energy transition, sustainable mobility, industrial decarbonization and sustainable resource use.\nPerpetual Capital \nIncluded within our investing strategies above is $446.5 billion of perpetual capital, out of the $751.0 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, perpetual capital includes, without limitation, certain assets in our credit strategy, including assets relating to publicly traded and non-traded vehicles, certain origination platform assets and assets managed for certain of our retirement services clients. Perpetual capital assets may be withdrawn under certain circumstances and utilize a range of investment strategies, including those described previously. \nAthene \nApollo’s asset management business, through its consolidated subsidiary, ISG, provides a full suite of services for Athene’s investment portfolio, including direct investment management, asset allocation, mergers and acquisitions asset diligence, and certain operational support services, including investment compliance, tax, legal and risk management support. See “Item 1. Business—Our Businesses—Retirement Services” for further details regarding Athene’s retirement services business. As of December 31, 2024, Apollo managed or advised $331.5 billion of AUM, of which $325.7 billion was Fee-Generating AUM, in accounts owned by or related to Athene (“Athene Accounts”). \nAthora\nApollo’s asset management business, through its consolidated subsidiary, ISGI, provides investment advisory services to certain portfolio companies of Apollo funds and Athora, a strategic liabilities platform that acquires or reinsures blocks of insurance business in the German and broader European life insurance market (collectively, the “Athora Accounts”). As of December 31, 2024, Apollo, through its subsidiaries, managed or advised $52.4 billion of AUM and $50.5 billion of Fee-Generating AUM in Athora Accounts. See note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for details regarding the fee arrangements between the Company and Athora.\nAthora Non-Sub-Advised Assets\nThis category includes the Athora assets which are managed by Apollo but not sub-advised by Apollo nor invested in Apollo funds or investment vehicles. We refer to these assets collectively as “Athora Non-Sub-Advised Assets.” Our AUM within the Athora Non-Sub-Advised category totaled $32.4 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which $30.6 billion was Fee-Generating AUM.\n14\nTable of Contents\nCapital Solutions\nOur capital solutions business focuses on (i) sourcing investment opportunities for asset management clients and their respective portfolio investments, (ii) maintaining relationships with the capital markets community in an effort to help clients and their respective portfolio investments to raise debt and equity capital, provide secondary market support and optimize capital structures through creative financing solutions, and (iii) structuring capital solutions in an effort to enhance our ability to syndicate, place or otherwise transfer loans, securities and other financial instruments arising from financings in an effort to drive positive outcomes for our asset management clients and their respective portfolio investments. Our capital solutions business also provides a variety of services with respect to both security and non-security financial instruments, including loans, such as originating, arranging, structuring, and syndicating loans and private debt, as well as providing corporate finance advisory services and other similar services.\nFundraising and Investor Relations \nWithin the asset management business, our fundraising strategy consists of credit and equity strategies. We raise private capital from prominent institutional investors, including public and private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and foundations, private wealth platforms, family offices, high net worth individuals, and other institutional investors, and from public market investors, as in the case of MFIC and ARI. In our equity strategy and certain funds in our credit strategy, fundraising activities for new funds begin once the investor capital commitments for the current fund are largely invested or committed to be invested. The investor base includes new investors and investors from prior funds, which in many instances have increased their commitments to subsequent funds. In addition, many of our investment professionals commit their own capital to each corporate private equity fund.\nWe maintain a rigorous investment process for credit and equity investments, and have in place procedures to allocate investment opportunities among the funds we manage. We have professionals responsible for selecting, evaluating, structuring, performing due diligence on, negotiating, executing, monitoring and exiting investments for our traditional equity funds and credit funds we manage, respectively, as well as for pursuing operational improvements in the funds’ portfolio companies through management consulting arrangements in case of equity funds. Our investment committees for relevant funds review the analyses of prospective investments, and ultimately approve recommended investments and dispositions. \nThe processes by which the funds we manage receive and invest capital vary by investing strategy and type of fund. However, in all types of funds we manage, investors deliver capital when called by us as investment opportunities become available. We also have several perpetual capital vehicles with unlimited duration that raise capital by issuing equity securities in the public markets and can also issue debt. Our hedge fund style credit funds, generally structured as limited partnerships with customary redemption rights, continuously offer and sell shares or limited partner interests via private placements through monthly subscriptions, which are payable in full upon a fund’s acceptance of an investor’s subscription. The general partner’s capital commitment is determined through negotiation with the fund’s underlying investor base, and commitments are generally available for approximately six years. Generally, as each investment is realized, these funds first return the capital and expenses related to that investment and any previously realized investments to fund investors and then distribute any profits (which are typically shared 80% to the investors in equity funds and 20% to us, so long as the investors receive at least an 8% compounded annual return on their investment). Allocation of profits between fund investors and us, and the amount of the preferred return, among other provisions, varies for credit funds. Ownership interests in equity funds are not subject to redemption prior to termination of the funds. \nOur aim has been to build value in the portfolio companies of the credit and equity funds we manage. We are actively engaged with the management teams of these portfolio companies to maximize the underlying value of the business, by taking a holistic approach to value-creation and concentrating on both the asset side and liability side of the balance sheet of a company. For example, these portfolio companies may seek to capture discounts on publicly traded debt securities through exchange offers and potential debt buybacks. In addition, our established group purchasing program helps the funds' portfolio companies leverage the combined corporate spending among Apollo and portfolio companies of the funds it manages in order to seek to reduce costs, optimize payment terms and improve service levels for all program participants. \nThe value of the investments that have been made by funds are typically realized through either an initial public offering of common stock on a nationally recognized exchange or through the private sale of the companies in which funds have invested.\n15\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Partner and Professionals Investments and Co-Investments\nGeneral Partner Investments\nCertain management companies, general partners and co-invest vehicles are committed to contribute to the funds we manage and their affiliates. As a limited partner, general partner and manager of the Apollo funds, Apollo had unfunded capital commitments as of December 31, 2024 of $564 million.\nProfessionals Investments\nTo further align our interests with those of investors in the funds we manage, certain of our professionals have invested their own capital in the funds. Our professionals will either re-invest their performance fees to fund these investments or use cash on hand or funds borrowed from third parties. We generally have not historically charged management fees or performance fees on capital invested by our professionals directly in the funds.\nCo-Investments\nInvestors in many of the funds we manage, as well as certain other investors, may have the opportunity to make co-investments with the funds. Co-investments are investments in portfolio companies or other fund assets generally on the same terms and conditions as those to which the applicable fund is subject.\nRetirement Services\nOur retirement services business is conducted by Athene, a leading financial services company that specializes in issuing, reinsuring and acquiring retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs. Athene is led by a highly skilled management team with extensive industry experience and has its corporate headquarters located in West Des Moines, Iowa. Our asset management business provides a full suite of services for Athene’s investment portfolio, including direct investment management, asset allocation, mergers and acquisitions asset diligence and certain operational support services, including investment compliance, tax, legal and risk management support. As of December 31, 2024, Athene had 1,983 employees.\nOur retirement services business focuses on generating spread income by combining the two core competencies of (1) sourcing long-term, persistent liabilities and (2) using the global scale and reach of our asset management business to actively source or originate assets with Athene’s preferred risk and return characteristics. Athene’s investment philosophy is to invest a portion of its assets in securities that earn an incremental yield by taking measured liquidity and complexity risk and capitalize on its long-dated, persistent liability profile to prudently achieve higher net investment earned rates, rather than assuming incremental credit risk. A cornerstone of Athene’s investment philosophy is that given the operating leverage inherent in its business, modest investment outperformance can translate to outsized return performance. Because Athene maintains discipline in underwriting attractively priced liabilities, it has the ability to invest in a broad range of high-quality assets to generate attractive earnings.\nOur asset management expertise supports the sourcing and underwriting of assets for Athene’s portfolio. Athene is invested in a diverse array of primarily high-grade fixed income assets including corporate bonds, structured securities and commercial and residential real estate loans, among others. Athene establishes risk thresholds which in turn define risk tolerance across a wide range of factors, including credit risk, liquidity risk, concentration risk and caps on specific asset classes. In addition to other efforts, Athene manages the risk of rising interest rates by strategically allocating a meaningful portion of its investment portfolio into floating rate securities. Athene manages its interest rate risk in a declining rate environment through hedging activity or the issuance of additional floating rate liabilities to lower its overall net floating rate position. Athene also maintains holdings in less interest rate-sensitive investments, including CLOs, non-agency RMBS and various types of structured products, consistent with its strategy of pursuing incremental yield by assuming liquidity and complexity risk, rather than assuming incremental credit risk.\nRather than increase its allocation to higher risk securities to increase yield, Athene pursues the direct origination of high-quality, predominantly senior secured assets, which it believes possess greater alpha-generating qualities than securities that would otherwise be readily available in public markets. These direct origination strategies include investments sourced by (1) affiliated platforms that originate loans to third parties and in which Athene gains exposure directly to the loan or indirectly \n16\nTable of Contents\nthrough its ownership of the origination platform and/or securitizations of assets originated by the origination platform, and (2) our asset management team’s extensive network of direct relationships with predominantly investment-grade counterparties.\nAthene uses, and may continue to use, derivatives, including swaps, options, futures and forward contracts and reinsurance contracts to hedge risks such as current or future changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities, current or future changes in cash flows and changes in interest rates, equity markets, currency fluctuations and longevity.\nProducts\nAthene principally offers two product lines: annuities and funding agreements.\nAnnuities\nAthene’s primary product line is annuities, which include FIAs, Fixed Rate Annuities, Registered Index-Linked Annuities (“RILAs”), Payout Annuities and Group Annuities. \nFixed Indexed Annuities. \nFIAs are the largest percentage of Athene’s net reserve liabilities. FIAs are a type of insurance contract in which the policyholder makes one or more premium deposits that earn interest, on a tax deferred basis, at a crediting rate based on a specified market index, subject to a specified cap, spread or participation rate. FIAs allow policyholders the possibility of earning interest without significant risk to principal, unless the contract is surrendered during a surrender charge period. A market index tracks the performance of a specific group of stocks or other assets representing a particular segment of the market, or in some cases, an entire market. Athene generally buys options on the indices to which the FIAs are tied to hedge the associated market risk. The cost of the option is priced into the overall economics of the product as an option budget. \nAthene generates income on FIA products by earning an investment spread, based on the difference between (1) income earned on the investments supporting the liabilities and (2) the cost of funds, including fixed interest credited to customers, option costs, the cost of providing guarantees (net of rider fees), policy issuance and maintenance costs and commission costs.\nFixed Rate Annuities. \nFixed rate annuities include annual reset annuities and multi-year guarantee annuities (“MYGA”). Unlike FIAs, fixed rate annuities earn interest at a set rate (or declared crediting rate), rather than at a rate that may vary based on an index. Fixed rate annual reset annuities have a crediting rate that is typically guaranteed for one year. After such period, Athene has the ability to change the crediting rate at its discretion, generally once annually, to any rate at or above a guaranteed minimum rate. MYGAs are similar to annual reset annuities except that the initial crediting rate is guaranteed for a specified number of years, rather than just one year, before it may be changed at Athene’s discretion. After the initial crediting period, MYGAs can generally be reset annually.\nRegistered Index-Linked Annuities.\n RILAs are similar to FIAs in offering the policyholder the opportunity for tax-deferred growth based in part on the performance of a market index. Compared to an FIA, RILAs have the potential for higher returns but also have the potential for risk of loss to principal and related earnings. RILAs provide the ability for the policyholder to participate in the positive performance of certain market indices during a term, limited by a cap or adjusted for a participation rate. Negative performance of the market indices during a term can result in negative policyholder returns, with downside protection typically provided in the form of either a “buffer” or a “floor” to limit the policyholder’s exposure to market loss. A “buffer” is protection from negative exposure up to a certain percentage, typically 10 or 20 percent. A “floor” is protection from negative exposure less than a stated percentage (i.e., the policyholder risks exposure of loss up to the “floor,” but is protected against any loss in excess of this amount).\nPrivate Placement Variable Annuities (“PPVA”). \nPPVAs are not registered with the SEC and currently are only offered by private placement to purchasers meeting both the requirements as a qualified purchaser and an accredited investor under applicable federal securities laws. Variable annuities allow policyholders to participate directly in the investment experience of the underlying investment vehicles offered through the product. In a variable annuity, the policyholder assumes the full investment risk of the investment options chosen. The product allows the policyholder to allocate their money to a variety of variable separate account divisions that invest in a suite of underlying investment options and the potential to accumulate cash value on a tax-deferred basis. Athene’s PPVA product provides access to a suite of Apollo managed funds and other product offerings with no surrender charges and no GLWB or GMDB features. Athene generates income on its PPVA product by collecting a management fee that is a function of the policyholder’s account value.\n17\nTable of Contents\nIncome Riders to Fixed Annuity Products. \nThe income riders on Athene’s deferred annuities can be broadly categorized as either guaranteed or participating. Guaranteed income riders provide policyholders with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit, which permits policyholders to elect to receive guaranteed payments for life from their contract without having to annuitize their policies. Participating income riders tend to have lower levels of guaranteed income than guaranteed income riders but provide policyholders the opportunity to receive greater levels of income if the policies’ indexed crediting strategies perform well. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 26% of Athene’s deferred annuity account value contained rider benefits.\nWithdrawal Options for Deferred Annuities\n. After the first year following the issuance of a deferred annuity, the policyholder is typically permitted to make withdrawals up to 5% or 10% (depending on the contract) of the prior year’s value without a surrender charge or market value adjustment (“MVA”), subject to certain limitations. Withdrawals in excess of the allowable amounts are assessed a surrender charge and MVA if such withdrawals are made during the surrender charge period of the policy, which generally ranges from 3 to 20 years. The surrender charge for most Athene products at contract inception is generally between 7% and 15% of the contract value and decreases by approximately one percentage point per year during the surrender charge period. The weighted average surrender charge (excluding the impact of MVAs) was 6% for Athene’s deferred annuities as of December 31, 2024.\nAt maturity, the policyholder may elect to receive proceeds in the form of a single payment or an annuity. If the annuity option is selected, the policyholder will receive a series of payments either over the policyholder’s lifetime or over a fixed number of years, depending upon the terms of the contract. Some contracts permit annuitization prior to maturity.\nPayout Annuities. \nPayout annuities primarily consist of single premium immediate annuities (“SPIA”), supplemental contracts and structured settlements. Payout annuities provide a series of periodic payments for a fixed period of time or for the life of the policyholder, based upon the policyholder’s election at the time of issuance. The amounts, frequency and length of time of the payments are fixed at the outset of the annuity contract. SPIAs are often purchased by persons at or near retirement age who desire a steady stream of payments over a future period of years. Supplemental contracts are typically created upon the conversion of a death claim or the annuitization of a deferred annuity. Structured settlements generally relate to legal settlements.\nGroup Annuities\n. Group annuities issued in connection with pension group annuity transactions usually involve a single premium group annuity contract issued to discharge certain pension plan liabilities. The group annuities that Athene issues are nonparticipating contracts. The assets supporting the guaranteed benefits for each contract may be held in a separate account. Group annuity benefits may be purchased for current, retired and/or terminated employees and their beneficiaries covered under terminating or continuing pension plans. Both immediate and deferred annuity certificates may be issued pursuant to a single group annuity contract. Immediate annuity certificates cover those retirees and beneficiaries currently receiving payments, whereas deferred annuity certificates cover those participants who have not yet begun receiving benefit payments. Immediate annuity certificates have no cash surrender rights, whereas deferred annuity certificates may include an election to receive a lump sum payment, exercisable by the participant upon either the participant achieving a specified age or the occurrence of a specified event, such as termination of the participant’s employment.\nAthene earns income on group annuities based upon the spread between the return on the assets received in connection with the pension group annuity transaction and the cost of the pension obligations assumed. Group annuities expose Athene to longevity risk, which would be realized if plan participants live longer than assumed in underwriting the transaction, resulting in aggregate payments that exceed Athene’s expectations. However, Athene’s conservative underwriting process makes use of a wealth of reliable pre- and post-selection participant data, including mortality experience data, particularly for mid- to large-sized transactions, to mitigate this risk.\nFunding Agreements\nFunding agreements include those issued to institutions via direct issuances and those issued to special-purpose unaffiliated trusts in connection with Athene’s FABN and FABR programs. Funding agreements\n \nare issued opportunistically to institutional investors at attractive risk-adjusted funding costs. They are designed to provide an agreement holder with a guaranteed return of principal and periodic interest payments, while offering competitive yields and predictable returns. The interest rate can be fixed or floating. Athene also includes repurchase agreements with a term that exceeds one year at the time of execution within the funding agreement product category.\n18\nTable of Contents\nLife and Other\nLife and other products include life insurance policies assumed through reinsurance transactions, other retail products, including legacy run-off or ceded business, and statutory closed blocks.\nDistribution Channels\nAthene has developed four dedicated distribution channels to address the retirement services market: retail, flow reinsurance, institutional, and acquisitions and block reinsurance, which support opportunistic origination across different market environments. Additionally, Athene believes these distribution channels enable it to achieve stable asset growth while maintaining attractive returns.\nRetail\nAthene has built a scalable platform that allows it to originate and rapidly grow its business in deferred annuity products. Athene has developed a suite of retirement savings products, distributed through its network of 41 independent marketing organizations (“IMOs”) and its growing network of 19 banks and 151 broker-dealers, collectively representing approximately 140,000 independent agents in all 50 states. Athene is focused in every aspect of its retail channel on providing high quality products and service to its policyholders and maintaining appropriate financial protection over the life of their policies.\nFlow Reinsurance\nFlow reinsurance provides another channel for Athene to source liabilities with attractive crediting rates and offers insurance companies the opportunity to improve their product offerings and enhance their financial results. As in the retail channel, Athene does not pursue flow volume growth at the expense of profitability and will respond rapidly to adjust pricing for changes in asset yields.\nReinsurance is an arrangement under which an insurance company, the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance company, the ceding company or cedant, for all or a portion of certain insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company. Reinsurance is designed to (1) reduce the net amount at risk on individual risks, thereby enabling the ceding company to increase the volume of business it can underwrite, as well as increase the maximum risk it can underwrite on a single risk, (2) stabilize operating results by reducing volatility in the ceding company’s loss experience, (3) assist the ceding company in meeting applicable regulatory requirements and (4) enhance the ceding company’s financial strength and surplus position.\nWithin its flow reinsurance channel, Athene conducts third-party flow reinsurance transactions through its insurance subsidiaries. As a reinsurer, Athene partners with insurance companies to develop solutions to their capital requirements, enhance their presence in the retirement market and improve their financial results. Athene targets reinsuring spread-based liabilities which can include FIAs, MYGAs, traditional one-year guarantee fixed deferred annuities, immediate annuities, whole life insurance, universal life insurance, indexed universal life insurance and institutional products.\nInstitutional\nAthene’s institutional channel includes funding agreements and pension group annuity transactions. \nFunding Agreements\n. Funding agreements are comprised of funding agreements issued under Athene’s FABN program, secured and other funding agreements, funding agreements issued to the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and long-term repurchase agreements. Athene’s FABN program allows its special-purpose, unaffiliated statutory trust to offer its senior secured medium-term notes. The notes are underwritten and marketed by major investment banks’ broker-dealer operations and are sold to institutional investors. The net proceeds of the issuance of notes are used by the trust to purchase one or more funding agreements from Athene subsidiaries with matching interest and maturity payment terms. Athene also established a secured FABR program in which a special-purpose, unaffiliated entity enters into a repurchase agreement with a bank and the proceeds of the repurchase agreement are used by the special-purpose entity to purchase funding agreements from Athene subsidiaries. In addition to the funding agreements issued to special-purpose unaffiliated trusts or other unaffiliated entities, Athene engages in direct issuances with various institutions. Athene is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines and, through membership, has issued funding agreements to the FHLB in exchange for cash advances. Athene is required to provide collateral in excess of the funding agreement amounts outstanding, considering any discounts to the \n19\nTable of Contents\nsecurities posted and prepayment penalties. Long-term repurchase agreements with a term that exceeds one year at the time of execution are also included within the funding agreement product category.\nPension Group Annuities.\n Athene partners with institutions seeking to transfer and thereby reduce their obligation to pay future pension benefits to retirees and deferred participants through pension group annuities. Athene works with advisors, brokers and consultants to source pension group annuity transactions and design solutions that meet the needs of prospective pension group annuity counterparties and their participants, with a focus on medium- and large-sized deals involving retirees and/or deferred participants that are structured as either a buyout or a buy-in transaction. \n \nAcquisitions and Block Reinsurance\nAcquisitions\n. Acquisitions are a complementary source of growth for our retirement services business. Athene has a proven ability to acquire businesses in complex transactions at favorable terms, manage the liabilities acquired and reinvest the associated assets.\nBlock Reinsurance\n. Through block reinsurance transactions, Athene partners with life and annuity companies to decrease their exposure to one or more products or to divest of lower-margin or non-core segments of their businesses. Unlike acquisitions in which Athene acquires the assets or stock of a target company, block reinsurance allows Athene to contractually assume assets and liabilities associated with a certain book of business. In doing so, Athene contractually assumes responsibility for only that portion of the business that it deems desirable, without assuming additional liabilities. \nAs Athene continues to expand into new markets and geographies, it has been disciplined in only retaining liabilities that are core to its strategy and competitive advantages. This can be accomplished through structural solutions, including mortality and longevity reinsurance.\nCapital\n \nAthene believes it has a strong capital position and is well positioned to meet policyholder and other obligations. Athene measures capital sufficiency using various internal capital metrics which reflect management’s view on the various risks inherent to its business, the amount of capital required to support its core operating strategies and the amount of capital necessary to maintain its current ratings in a recessionary environment. The amount of capital required to support Athene’s core operating strategies is determined based upon internal modeling and analysis of economic risk, as well as inputs from rating agency capital models and consideration of both NAIC risk-based capital (“RBC”) and Bermuda capital requirements. Capital in excess of this required amount is considered excess equity capital, which is available to deploy.\nDeployable Capital\nAthene’s deployable capital is comprised of capital from three sources: excess equity capital, untapped leverage capacity and available undrawn capital commitments from ACRA. As of December 31, 2024, Athene estimates that it had approximately $8.8 billion in capital available to deploy, consisting of approximately $2.0 billion in excess equity capital, $3.3 billion in untapped leverage capacity (assuming an adjusted leverage ratio of not more than 30%, subject to maintaining a sufficient level of capital required to maintain Athene’s desired financial strength ratings from rating agencies), and $3.5 billion in available undrawn capital at ACRA.\nACRA\nIn order to support growth strategies and capital deployment opportunities, Athene established ACRA 1 as a long-duration, on-demand capital vehicle. Athene directly owns 37% of ACRA 1’s economic interests and all of ACRA 1’s voting interests, with the remaining 63% of the economic interests being owned by ADIP I. During the commitment period, ACRA 1 participated in certain transactions by drawing a portion of the required capital for such transactions from third-party investors equal to ADIP I’s proportionate economic interests in ACRA 1. The commitment period for ACRA 1 expired in August 2023.\nTo further support its growth and capital deployment opportunities following the deployment of capital by ACRA 1, Athene funded ACRA 2 in December 2022 as another long-duration, on-demand capital vehicle. Effective July 1, 2023, ALRe sold 50% of its non-voting, economic interests in ACRA 2 to ADIP II for $640 million, while maintaining all of ACRA 2’s voting interests. Effective December 31, 2023, ACRA 2 repurchased a portion of its shares held by ALRe, which increased ADIP II’s ownership of economic interests in ACRA 2 to 60%, with ALRe owning the remaining 40% of the economic interests. \n20\nTable of Contents\nEffective October 1, 2024, ACRA 2 repurchased a portion of its shares held by ALRe, which increased ADIP II’s ownership of economic interests in ACRA 2 to 63%, with ALRe owning the remaining 37% of the economic interests. ACRA 2 participates in certain transactions by drawing a portion of the required capital for such transactions from third-party investors equal to ADIP II’s proportionate economic interests in ACRA 2. \nThese strategic capital solutions are designed to provide Athene the flexibility to simultaneously deploy capital across multiple accretive avenues and sustain a profitable growth strategy at scale in a capital efficient manner, while maintaining a strong financial position.\nUses of Capital \nAthene’s capital deployment includes the payment for a business opportunity, such as the payment of a ceding commission to enter into a block reinsurance transaction, and the retention of capital based on Athene’s internal capital model. Currently, Athene deploys capital in four primary ways: (1) supporting organic growth, (2) supporting inorganic growth, (3) making dividend payments to AGM, and (4) retaining capital to support financial strength ratings upgrades. Athene generally seeks mid-teen or higher returns on its capital deployment. \nReinsurance\nInternal Ceded Reinsurance\nSubject to quota shares generally ranging from 80% to 100%, substantially all of the existing deposits held and new deposits generated by Athene’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are reinsured to its Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries. Athene maintains the same reserving principles for its Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries as it does for its U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Athene also retrocedes certain inorganic transactions and organic business to ACRA.\n \nAthene’s internal reinsurance structure provides it with several strategic and operational advantages, including the aggregation of regulatory capital, which makes the aggregate capital of its Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries available to support the risks assumed by each entity, and enhanced operating efficiencies. As a result of its internal reinsurance structure and third-party direct to Bermuda business, a significant majority of Athene’s aggregate capital is held by its Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries.\nThird-Party Ceded Reinsurance\nIn addition, from time to time, Athene may opportunistically cede certain of its business from its U.S. insurance subsidiaries, or Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries, to third party reinsurers, to generate capital and/or limit exposure to certain risks.\nRatings\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, each of Athene’s significant insurance subsidiaries is rated “A+” or “A1” by the four rating agencies that evaluate the financial strength of such subsidiaries. To achieve its financial strength ratings aspirations, Athene may choose to retain additional capital above the level required by the rating agencies to support operating needs. Athene believes there are numerous benefits to achieving stronger ratings over time, including increased recognition of and confidence in its financial strength by prospective business partners, particularly within product distribution, as well as potential profitability improvements in certain organic channels through lower funding costs. Financial strength and credit ratings directly affect Athene’s ability to access funding and the related cost of borrowing, the attractiveness of certain Athene products to customers, its attractiveness as a reinsurer to potential ceding companies and the requirements for collateral posting on its derivatives. These ratings are periodically reviewed by the rating agencies.\nPrincipal Investing\nOur Principal Investing segment is comprised of our realized performance fee income, realized investment income from our balance sheet investments, and certain allocable expenses related to corporate functions supporting the entire company. The Principal Investing segment also includes our growth capital and liquidity resources at AGM. Over time, we may deploy capital into strategic investments that help accelerate the growth of our Asset Management segment, by broadening our investment management and/or product distribution capabilities or increasing the efficiency of our operations. We believe these investments may translate into greater compounded annual growth of Fee Related Earnings.\n21\nTable of Contents\nGiven the cyclical nature of performance fees, earnings from our Principal Investing segment, or PII, are inherently more volatile in nature than earnings from the Asset Management and Retirement Services segments. We earn fees based on the investment performance of the funds we manage and compensate our employees, primarily investment professionals, with a meaningful portion of these proceeds to align our team with the investors in the funds we manage and incentivize them to deliver strong investment performance over time. To enhance this alignment, we have increased the proportion of performance fee income we pay to our employees over the last few years.\nCompetition\n \nAsset Management\nWithin the asset management business, Apollo operates in an intensely competitive industry, and expects it to remain so. We compete globally and on a regional, industry and niche basis.\nWe face competition both in the pursuit of investor capital and in making investments on behalf of funds and accounts we manage across credit and equity asset classes. We compete for investor capital based on a variety of factors, including:\n•\ninvestment performance as a metric for assessing excess return per unit of risk;\n•\ninvestor perception of investment managers’ drive, focus and alignment of interest;\n•\nquality of service provided to and duration of relationship with investors;\n•\nbusiness reputation; and\n•\nthe level of fees and expenses charged for services.\nCompetition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively within our industry will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.\nRetirement Services\nAthene faces competition from a variety of large and small industry participants, including diversified financial institutions and insurance and reinsurance companies. These companies compete in one form or another for the growing pool of retirement assets driven by a number of external factors such as the continued aging of the population and the reduction in safety nets provided by governments and private employers. In the markets in which Athene operates, scale and the ability to provide value-added services and build long-term relationships are important factors to compete effectively. Athene believes that its leading presence in the retirement services market, diverse range of capabilities and broad distribution network uniquely position it to effectively serve consumers’ increasing demand for retirement solutions.\nAthene experiences competition in the fixed annuity market from all traditional carriers and new entrants. Principal competitive factors for fixed annuities are initial crediting rates, reputation for renewal crediting action, product features, brand recognition, customer service, distribution capabilities and financial strength ratings of the provider. Competition may affect, among other matters, both business growth and the pricing of products and services.\nReinsurance markets are highly competitive, as well as cyclical by product and market. As a reinsurer, Athene competes based on many factors, including, among other things, financial strength, pricing and other terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements, reputation, service, and experience in the types of business underwritten. The impact of these and other factors is generally not consistent across lines of business, domestic and international geographical areas, and distribution channels. Within the reinsurance market, Athene competes with other insurance and reinsurance companies.\nAthene encounters strong competition within its institutional channel. With respect to funding agreements, namely those issued in connection with its FABN program, Athene competes with other insurers that have active FABN programs. Within the funding agreement market, it competes primarily on the basis of perceived financial strength, interest rates and term. With respect to group annuities, Athene competes with other insurers that offer such annuities. Within the pension group annuities market, it competes primarily on the basis of price, underwriting, investment capabilities and its ability to provide quality service to the corporate sponsor’s pension participants.\nFinally, Athene experiences competition in the market for acquisition targets and profitable blocks of insurance. Such competition is likely to intensify as insurance businesses become more attractive acquisition targets for both other insurance \n22\nTable of Contents\ncompanies and financial institutions and as the already substantial consolidation in the financial services industry continues. Athene competes for potential acquisition and block reinsurance opportunities based on a number of factors including perceived financial strength, brand recognition, reputation and the pricing it is able to offer, which, to the extent Athene determines to finance a transaction, is in turn dependent on its ability to do so on suitable terms. Athene believes its demonstrated ability to source and consummate large and complex transactions is a competitive advantage over other potential acquirers.\nFor additional information concerning the competitive risks that we face, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Operating Risks—\nWe operate in highly competitive industries, which could limit our ability to achieve our growth strategies and could materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.”\nHuman Capital\nApollo’s talent is instrumental to our success as a global alternative asset manager and retirement services provider. Investing in and fostering a modern and inclusive high-performance culture is core to operating our business and delivering positive outcomes for our shareholders and fund investors, and our employee value proposition is designed to engage and develop our talent to deliver maximum impact. We believe our commitment to expanding opportunity across our ecosystem is central to the Apollo business model, an integrated platform which fosters strong collaboration across businesses and functions. Rooted in our core values, we strive to build a culture where all of our people can excel and grow in their careers.\nTalent Development\nWe believe that ongoing professional development is a critical part of our culture at Apollo and an important enabler of our investment process. Because of our entrepreneurial culture, the breadth of our integrated platform, and our reputation for strong investment performance, we believe we can attract, develop and retain top talent. We have development programs in place across a variety of levels which demonstrate our commitment to developing, engaging and retaining our employees. In addition to our training and annual review programs, we have instituted annual employee surveys that measure employee satisfaction and engagement and help evaluate and guide human capital decision-making. We work in partnership with our employees to maintain a strong culture which prioritizes excellence and outperforming expectations to advance our goal of being a modern high-performance workplace that is also great place to work. \nCompensation and Benefits\nWe work to offer a compelling employee value proposition to reward strong performance and support our employees’ professional development and well-being. Our pay for performance compensation philosophy is designed to reward employees for performance and to align employee interests with the firm’s long-term growth and with our shareholders. All of our employees are granted stock through a range of equity-based compensation programs, including our One Apollo stock program. Our benefits programs are intended to support our employees and their families, and include healthcare, wellness initiatives, retirement programs, paid time off and family leave.\nExpanding Opportunity\nApollo is committed to championing opportunity and fostering a culture of excellence where everyone has an opportunity to thrive. We make talent decisions based on the qualities necessary to succeed in our modern high-performance workplace, focusing on skills, experience, and performance that drive results, rather than demographic characteristics or preferences. Reducing individuals to a single trait — whether gender, race, or ethnicity — misses the full picture of their capabilities, contributions, and potential impact. At the same time, we believe that a workforce of extraordinary people from a wide range of backgrounds and viewpoints helps us solve complex problems, drive innovation, and achieve great results over the long term. We are committed to expanding opportunity across our ecosystem – our workplace, in our marketplace, and in the communities where we live and work – to ensure that we attract and grow the best talent and business partners from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences who can perform at the highest levels for Apollo. \nCitizenship\nApollo seeks to actively invest in our communities and engage our employees and other stakeholders in meaningful and impactful Citizenship Programs. Apollo offers its employees philanthropic, volunteer, and other forms of engagement to strengthen communities and expand opportunity around the globe. To empower employees to give back, Apollo hosts volunteer events and provides Citizenship Grants for matching gifts and volunteer rewards each year. Apollo is proud to amplify the \n23\nTable of Contents\nefforts of employees, supporting the communities in which they live and the causes and organizations of greatest importance to them. \nApollo Opportunity Foundation\nThe Apollo Opportunity Foundation was launched in February 2022 to invest in non-profit organizations working to expand opportunity for underrepresented individuals. The Apollo Opportunity Foundation’s mission is to expand opportunity in communities where our employees live and work around the globe by deploying our capital and engaging our people to invest in career education, workforce development and economic empowerment for all. The Apollo Opportunity Foundation seeks to partner with organizations that are championed by our people to advance economic prosperity and expand opportunity for underrepresented individuals.\nSustainable Investing and Corporate Responsibility\nAt Apollo, we believe that taking all available factors into account can help drive value creation. We have taken an integrated approach to incorporating financially material environmental, social, and/or governance considerations into how we invest, how we lend, and how we operate our firm globally. Our strategy prioritizes the creation of economic value for our shareholders and addressing the needs of our clients and employees in a responsible way. Corporate responsibility and sustainability matters are reviewed by a committee of the AGM board of directors. We have also adopted several policies, including an environmental, health and safety policy, a human rights policy, and a supplier code of conduct. In addition, we publish on our website an annual sustainability report, which provides further details about our approach to corporate responsibility.\nRegulatory and Compliance Matters\nOur businesses, as well as the financial services and insurance industries generally, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and around the world. Virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various laws and regulations, some of which are summarized below. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds, insurance businesses, broker-dealers and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. \nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory and compliance requirements may result in a variety of consequences, including fines, administrative measures, suspension of voting rights, suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time or mandatory disposal of interests in any affected regulated entity, revocation of investment adviser, insurance, broker-dealer and other registrations, licenses or charters, censures and other regulatory sanctions.\nThe legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business are ever evolving and may become more restrictive, which may make compliance with applicable requirements more difficult or expensive or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct our business activities in the manner in which they are now conducted. Our businesses have operated for many years within a legal framework that requires us being able to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities. However, additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability.\nThe complex regulatory frameworks governing financial institutions, insurance companies, insurance distributors and their respective holding companies and subsidiaries, as well as those with investments in them, are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.\nFinancial Services Regulation\nOur financial services businesses, subsidiaries and/or affiliates are regulated under, among others, the Investment Advisers Act; the Investment Company Act; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”); the Commodity Exchange Act; the U.K. Financial Services and Markets Act 2000; the European Union and U.K. Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive; the European Union and U.K. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive; the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “FSOC”) and similar non-U.S. regulators; the Federal Reserve; the SEC; FINRA; the \n24\nTable of Contents\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission and National Futures Association; the U.S. Department of Labor; the Internal Revenue Service; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; the Federal Communications Commission; banking and financial regulators in the European Union, its member states and the U.K.; as well as rules and regulations over credit risk retention, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers, “over the counter” derivatives markets, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, gaming companies and natural resources companies. \nRegulation under the Investment Advisers Act\n. We conduct our advisory business primarily through our directly owned investment adviser subsidiaries, including Apollo Capital Management, L.P., Apollo Investment Management, L.P., Apollo Credit Management, LLC, ARIS Management, LLC, Apollo Capital Credit Adviser, LLC, Apollo Real Estate Fund Adviser, LLC, Apollo Manager, LLC and Apollo S3 RIC Management, L.P., each of which is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. Apollo Capital Management, L.P. has a number of relying advisers that operate a single advisory business and rely on umbrella registration to be deemed registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. All of our SEC-registered investment advisers are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act, including, among other things, maintaining an effective compliance program reasonably designed for our business, maintaining a Code of Ethics for employee trading, record keeping, marketing, disclosure, custody, and acting consistently with each advisers’ fiduciary duty to its clients. \nRegulation as a Broker-Dealer\n. Apollo Global Securities, LLC (“AGS”), Griffin Capital Securities, LLC (“GCS”) and Athene Securities, LLC (“Athene Securities”), each of which is a subsidiary of Apollo, are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and in the U.S. states and territories and are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, the implementation of a supervisory control system and effective compliance program, advertising and sales practices, conduct of and compensation in connection with public securities offerings, maintenance of adequate net capital, financial reporting, record keeping, and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers, employees and other associated persons. State securities regulators also have regulatory oversight authority over AGS, GCS and Athene Securities. In addition, one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, Apollo Capital Solutions Europe B.V., is regulated under relevant broker-dealer regulations in the Netherlands. See “—Regulated Entities Outside of the U.S.” below.\nRegulation as a Commodity Pool Operator, Commodity Trading Advisor and Investment Company\n. Certain investment activities in which Apollo managers engage may subject those managers to provisions of the Commodities Exchange Act and oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and National Futures Association, including registration as a commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor. Apollo intends to rely on exemptions from registration when available.\nIn addition, certain of the funds we manage are registered management investment companies under the Investment Company Act. \nOther U.S. and Foreign Regulation\n. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing payments and contributions to public officials or other parties, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as economic sanctions and export control laws administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State.\nAs a result of certain investments of ours and the funds we manage in financial institutions that operate outside of the United States, Apollo is subject to regulatory supervision by international financial regulators, including European Union, European Union member state and U.K. financial regulators and applicable requirements set forth in the relevant banking, consumer finance and other financial services regulations of such jurisdictions. In certain cases, such regulations impose suitability and conduct standards on the Company and require notice to and in certain instances approval of, the relevant regulatory authority of an intent to increase or decrease holdings in the relevant entity outside of specified thresholds, or other contemplated changes in structure, or transactions. Failure to comply with these applicable requirements may result in a variety of consequences, including fines, administrative measures, suspension of voting rights, mandatory disposal of interests in the regulated entity or other regulatory sanctions.\nInsurance Regulation\nOur businesses, subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to a wide variety of insurance and insurance holding company system laws and regulations in both the United States and numerous other jurisdictions, including the European Union, Bermuda, the U.K., Switzerland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, Singapore, Cayman Islands, Canada and Malaysia.\n25\nTable of Contents\nUnited States\nWithin the United States, each state’s insurance laws require each of our insurance company subsidiaries to be licensed and regulated by the commissioner, superintendent or director of the insurance department (each, a “Commissioner”) of its domiciliary state and each state in which it transacts insurance as an admitted insurer. The extent of such regulation varies by state, but as a general matter, state Commissioners have broad administrative powers over the business activities and financial aspects of our insurance company subsidiaries, including pursuant to state laws and regulations requiring the licensing of producers who sell the insurance company’s products, regulating premium rates and approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, solvency standards and minimum capital requirements, regulating the type, amounts and valuations of investments permitted, examining the business conduct of licensed insurance companies and other matters. \nAs the ultimate controlling entity, we are subject to the insurance holding company system laws of the domiciliary state of each insurance company subsidiary, which requires, among other filings, its annual registration statement filing with the Commissioner of its domiciliary state and the submission of our financial information and other information about the operations of companies within its holding company system, including submission of an annual enterprise risk report identifying material risks within the holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to our insurance company subsidiaries. These laws also impose restrictions and limitations on the ability of an insurance company subsidiary to pay dividends and make other distributions to its parent company. In addition, transactions between an insurance company and other companies within its holding company system, including sales, loans, investments, reinsurance agreements, tax allocation agreements, management agreements and service agreements, must be on terms that are fair and reasonable and, if material or within a specified category, require prior notice to and approval or non-disapproval by the applicable domiciliary state Commissioner. \nAll states have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer, which would include a change of control of its holding company. Such laws prevent any person from acquiring direct or indirect control of any of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries or their holding companies unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the Commissioner and has obtained the Commissioner’s prior approval. Under such state statutes, generally acquiring 10% or more of a voting interest in an insurer or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of a voting interest in a direct or indirect parent of any of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries without the prior approval of the Commissioner of the applicable state will be in violation of the applicable state’s law and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the Commissioner or prohibiting the voting of those securities and/or to other actions determined by the Commissioner. Further, a willful violation of these laws is punishable in each state as a criminal offense. \nThese laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent an acquisition of control of a direct or indirect parent of any of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries (in particular through an unsolicited transaction), even if the stockholders of such parent consider such transaction to be desirable.\nAll 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have insurance guaranty fund laws requiring insurance companies doing business within those jurisdictions to participate in guaranty associations. Guaranty associations are organized to cover, subject to limits, contractual obligations under insurance policies issued by insurance companies which later become impaired or insolvent. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on each member insurer doing business in a particular state on the basis of their proportionate share of the premiums written by all member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer previously engaged. Most states limit assessments in any year to 2% of the insurer’s average annual premium for the three years preceding the calendar year in which the impaired insurer became impaired or insolvent. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets, usually over a period of years. Assessments levied against Athene’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries by guaranty associations during the year ended December 31, 2024 were not material. While we cannot accurately predict the amount of any such future assessments, or past or future insolvencies of competitors which would lead to such assessments, it is possible that any such assessments with respect to pending insurers’ impairments and insolvencies may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows, and any reserves we have previously established for these potential assessments may not be adequate.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOther Jurisdictions\nThe operations of our insurance subsidiaries and branches operating outside the United States are subject to the local regulatory and supervisory schemes in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which vary widely from country to country; however, regulators typically grant licenses to operate and control an insurance business in a specific jurisdiction. In general, insurance regulators in most jurisdictions have the administrative power to supervise the registration of agents, regulation of product features and product approvals, asset allocation, minimum capital requirements, solvency and reserves, policyholder liabilities, and investments. Regulatory authorities may also regulate affiliations with other financial institutions, stockholder structures and may impose restrictions on declaring dividends and the ability to effect certain capital transactions, and many jurisdictions require insurance companies to participate in policyholder protection schemes.\nMany of the insurance regulatory frameworks that govern our and our affiliated funds’ insurance entities operating outside the United States require the prior consent of the applicable regulator in such jurisdictions before (i) any person can become a “controller”/“qualifying holder” or acquire a direct or indirect control/qualifying holding (\ne.g.\n, 10%, 20%, 30% or 33% and 50%) in any regulated company, or over the parent undertaking of any such regulated company or (ii) any increase of an existing holding that would result in a person reaching the applicable thresholds of the jurisdiction (\ne.g.\n, 10%, 20%, 30% or 33% and 50%). In addition, certain regulators require the insurance entities or their controllers/qualifying holders to notify the appropriate regulator of any prospective changes in organizational structure of which they are aware, sometimes regardless of whether the controller/qualifying holder or the proposed controller/qualifying holder would be required to submit a change in control application or an application to acquire control/a qualifying holding as a result of such changes in organizational structure. Breach of the requirements to notify the relevant regulator of a decision to acquire or increase control/holding, or of the requirement to obtain approval before completing the relevant control/qualifying holding transaction may in some jurisdictions be a criminal offense attracting potentially unlimited fines. Regulators can also seek other remedies, including suspension of voting rights in the relevant insurance undertaking or having the purported acquisition annulled. \nIn particular, the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the “BMA”), which regulates Athene, Athora and Catalina (as defined below), maintains supervision over the “controllers” of all registered insurers in Bermuda. For these purposes, a “controller” includes (1) the managing director of the registered insurer or its parent company, (2) the chief executive of the registered insurer or of its parent company, (3) a stockholder controller, and (4) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or its parent company are accustomed to act.\nThe definition of stockholder controller is set out in the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 (the “Bermuda Insurance Act”) and generally refers to (1) a person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at a stockholders’ meeting of the registered insurer or its parent company, (2) a person who is entitled to exercise 10% or more of the voting power at any stockholders’ meeting of such registered insurer or its parent company or (3) a person who is able to exercise significant influence over the management of the registered insurer or its parent company by virtue of its shareholding or its entitlement to exercise, or control the exercise of, the voting power at any stockholders’ meeting.\nUnder the Bermuda Insurance Act, stockholder controller ownership is defined as follows:\nActual Stockholder Controller Voting Power\nDefined Stockholder Controller Voting Power\n10% or more but less than 20%\n10%\n20% or more but less than 33%\n20%\n33% or more but less than 50%\n33%\n50% or more\n50%\nWhere the shares of a registered insurer, or the shares of its parent company, are traded on a recognized stock exchange, and such stockholder becomes a 10%, 20%, 33%, or 50% stockholder controller of the insurer, that stockholder shall, within 45 days, notify the BMA in writing that such stockholder has become, or as a result of a disposition ceased to be, a controller of any such category.\nAny person or entity who contravenes the Bermuda Insurance Act by failing to give notice or knowingly becoming a controller of any description before the required 45 days has elapsed is guilty of an offense under Bermuda law and liable to a fine of $25,000 on summary conviction.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe BMA may file a notice of objection to any person or entity who has become a controller of any category when it appears that such person or entity is not, or is no longer, fit and proper to be a controller of the registered insurer. Before issuing a notice of objection, the BMA is required to serve upon the person or entity concerned a preliminary written notice stating the BMA’s intention to issue formal notice of objection. Upon receipt of the preliminary written notice, the person or entity served may, within 28 days, file written representations with the BMA which shall be taken into account by the BMA in making its final determination. Any person or entity who continues to be a controller of any description after having received a notice of objection is guilty of an offense and liable on summary conviction to a fine of $25,000 (and a continuing fine of $500 per day for each day that the offense is continuing) or, if convicted on indictment, to a fine of $100,000 and/or 2 years in prison.\nThe Bermuda Insurance Act regulates the insurance business of our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries, and provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under such act by the BMA. The BMA is required by the Bermuda Insurance Act to determine whether an applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise to operate an insurance business. The continued registration of an insurer is subject to the insurer complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose from time to time. The Bermuda Insurance Act also grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurers. The Bermuda Insurance Act imposes on Bermuda insurers solvency standards, as well as auditing and reporting requirements.\nIn March 2024, following feedback from stakeholders, the BMA introduced certain new requirements designed to enhance Bermuda’s regulatory regime for commercial insurers. In addition to potential enhancements to technical provisions and computation of the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement, the guidance notes set forth requirements designed to strengthen supervisory cooperation and exchange of information and increased publication of regulatory information to further develop good governance and risk management practices, transparency, and market discipline. \nIn the U.K., Apollo is considered the controller of certain insurance company (or equivalent) subsidiaries of Catalina Holdings (Bermuda) Ltd. (“Catalina”) and Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited (“Aspen”), including Catalina Worthing Insurance Limited, Aspen Insurance UK Limited (“Aspen U.K.”), which is domiciled in the U.K. and operates regulated branches in Australia, Canada, Singapore, Switzerland, and Aspen Managing Agency Limited, the Lloyd’s managing agent of Syndicate 4711, which has its underwriting capacity provided by Aspen’s subsidiary Aspen Underwriting Limited, a Lloyd’s corporate member. In addition, Catalina Services UK Limited and Aspen U.K. Syndicate Services Limited are also domiciled in the U.K. and provide insurance distribution services for purposes of certain U.K. insurance regulations.\nIn Ireland, Apollo is deemed to hold an indirect qualifying holding in Athora Ireland plc, which is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Athora Life Re Ltd. An indirect qualifying holding in Athora Ireland Services Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Athora, is also attributed to Apollo via Apollo’s indirect interest in Athora. \nApollo is deemed to hold an indirect qualifying holding in Athora Deutschland Verwaltungs GmbH, Athora Deutschland Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Athora Deutschland GmbH, Athora Lebensversicherung AG and Athora Pensionskasse AG, which are either German regulated insurance undertakings or German insurance holding companies.\nApollo is deemed to hold an indirect qualifying holding in Athora Belgium S.A./N.V. (“Athora Belgium”), which is a Belgian licensed insurance and reinsurance undertaking. In addition, some of Athora Belgium’s subsidiaries are registered with the Belgian regulator as insurance brokers and are subject to supervision by the Belgian regulator as regards their insurance distribution activities.\nApollo is deemed to hold an indirect qualifying holding in Athora Netherlands N.V. (formerly known as: VIVAT N.V.), Proteq Levensverzekeringen N.V., and SRLEV N.V., which are either Dutch regulated insurance undertakings or a Dutch insurance holding company, and Zwitserleven PPI N.V., which is a Dutch premium pension institution.\nAdditionally, Catalina carries on insurance business through its Singapore-domiciled subsidiary Asia Capital Reinsurance Group Pte. Ltd., which in turn operates through its subsidiaries in Malaysia.\n28\nTable of Contents\nRegulation of an Insurance Group\nMany insurers, including certain of our subsidiaries, operate within a group structure with two or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer. U.S. state and international regulators have developed group supervisory frameworks in order to provide regulators with the ability to scrutinize the activities of an insurance group and assess its potential impact on individual insurers within the group. \nA group supervisor may impose certain requirements on the insurance group, including to make provision for, among other things: (1) assessing the financial situation and the solvency position of the insurance group and/or its members and (2) regulating intra-group transactions, risk concentration, governance procedures, risk management and regulatory reporting and disclosure. These requirements as applied in substance to us or our affiliates have been applied as part of larger prudential regulatory initiatives.\nGovernment agencies and insurance standard setters in the U.S. and worldwide have become increasingly interested in potential risks posed by the insurance industry as a whole, and to commercial and financial activities and systems in general, as indicated by the adoption in 2019 of the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (“ComFrame”) by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”). ComFrame will apply for all large internationally active insurance groups (“IAIGs”) designated as an IAIG by their group-wide supervisor. On February 6, 2024, the Iowa Insurance Division (the “IID”) identified Apollo as meeting the criteria as an IAIG and further identified Athene as the head of the IAIG. In general, the head of the IAIG is the uppermost entity to which obligations associated with an IAIG designation attach. As a result of these identifications, we expect Athene to be subject to the relevant capital standard that the U.S. applies to IAIGs. The IID further identified itself as the Group-Wide Supervisor for Apollo (in a distinct capacity from its role as supervisor for Athene). Iowa has been effectively serving in this role for a significant period of time; this identification is a formal recognition of the IID’s existing supervisory relationship to Apollo. At this time, we do not expect a significant impact on Athene’s capital position or capital structure; however, we cannot fully predict with certainty the impact (if any) on Athene’s capital position or capital structure and any other burdens being named an IAIG may impose on Athene or its insurance affiliates.\nCapital Requirements\nEach of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries is subject to regulatory capital requirements based upon the laws and regulations of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Regulators of each jurisdiction in which we operate have discretionary authority in connection with our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries’ continued licensing to limit or prohibit sales to policyholders within their respective jurisdiction or to restrict continued operation of insurers or reinsurers domiciled in their respective jurisdiction if, in their judgment, such entities have not maintained the required level of minimum surplus or capital or that the further transaction of business would be hazardous to policyholders or reinsurance counterparties.\nRestrictions on Dividends and Other Distributions\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends. Any proposed dividend in excess of the amount permitted by law is considered an extraordinary dividend or extraordinary distribution and may not be paid until it has been approved, or generally a 30-day waiting period has passed during which it has not been disapproved, by the Commissioner. In addition, Bermuda regulated insurers are strictly prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends unless certain financial conditions are met or prior approval from the BMA is received.\nConsumer Protection Laws and Privacy and Data Security Regulation\nFederal and state consumer protection laws affect our operations. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. In addition, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 implemented fundamental changes in the regulation of the financial services industry in the United States and includes privacy and security requirements for financial institutions, including obligations to protect and safeguard consumers’ nonpublic personal information and records, limitations on the re-disclosure and re-use of such information and requirements to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of such information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information.\n29\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to federal and other financial institution-specific privacy laws and regulations, an increasing number of states are considering and passing comprehensive privacy legislation. The issues surrounding data security and the safeguarding of consumers’ protected information are under increasing regulatory scrutiny by state and federal regulators.\nRegulated Entities Outside of the U.S.\nCertain of our subsidiaries and the funds that we manage that operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States are licensed by or have obtained authorizations to operate in their respective jurisdictions outside of the United States, and as a result are regulated by various international regulators and subject to applicable regulation. These registrations, licenses or authorizations relate to providing investment advice, discretionary investment management, arranging deals, marketing securities, capital markets activities and other regulated activities. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing these subsidiaries that have been registered, licensed or authorized could expose us to liability and/or damage our reputation.\nOutside of the U.S., our subsidiaries and the funds that we manage, including Apollo Management International LLP, Apollo Credit Management International Limited, Apollo Asset Management Europe LLP, Apollo Asset Management Europe PC LLP, Apollo Investment Management Europe LLP, Apollo Investment Management Europe (Luxembourg) S.à r.l., Apollo Capital Solutions Europe B.V., Apollo Advisors (Mauritius) Ltd, AION Capital Management Limited, Apollo Management Singapore Pte. Ltd., Apollo Management Singapore Pte. Ltd., Apollo Management Asia Pacific Limited, Apollo Management Japan Limited, PK AirFinance Japan Godo Kaisha and PK AIR 1 JPN Godo Kaisha, are subject to regulation in the European Union, the Abu Dhabi Global Market, the U.K., India, Mauritius, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan. \nOther Regulatory Considerations\n. Certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, the privacy of client information, cybersecurity and AI. Any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. \nRigorous legal and compliance analysis of our businesses and investments is important to our culture. We strive to maintain a culture of compliance through the use of policies and procedures, such as our code of ethics, compliance systems, communication of compliance guidance and employee education and training. We have a compliance group that monitors our compliance with the regulatory requirements to which we are subject and manages our compliance policies and procedures. Our Chief Compliance Officer supervises our compliance group, which is responsible for addressing all regulatory and compliance matters that affect our activities. Our compliance policies and procedures address a variety of regulatory and compliance risks such as the handling of material non-public information, personal securities trading, anti-bribery, financial crimes compliance, valuation of investments on a fund-specific basis, document retention, potential conflicts of interest and the allocation of investment opportunities.\nApollo has established certain one-way and/or two-way information barriers in respect of discrete investment strategies (based on established policies and procedures in respect of information barriers). However, we generally operate without permanent information barriers between our asset management businesses. In an effort to manage possible risks resulting from our decision not to implement these barriers, our compliance personnel maintain restricted securities lists and other internal controls. We could in the future decide that it is advisable to establish permanent information barriers, particularly as our business expands and diversifies. In such event our ability to operate as an integrated platform would be restricted. \nAvailable Information\n \nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act are made available free of charge on or through our website at ir.apollo.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Apollo Global Management, Inc.’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those included in the section of this report entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” The highlights listed below have had significant effects on many items within our consolidated financial statements and affect the comparison of the current period’s activity with those of prior periods.\nGeneral\nOur Businesses\nFounded in 1990, Apollo is a high-growth, global alternative asset manager and a retirement services provider. Apollo conducts its business primarily in the United States through the following three reportable segments: Asset Management, Retirement Services and Principal Investing. These business segments are differentiated based on the investment services they provide as well as varying investing strategies. As of December 31, 2024, Apollo had a team of 5,108 employees, including 1,983 employees of Athene.\nAsset Management\nOur Asset Management segment focuses on credit and equity investing strategies. We have a flexible mandate in many of the funds we manage which enables the funds to invest opportunistically across a company’s capital structure. We raise, invest and manage funds, accounts and other vehicles on behalf of some of the world’s most prominent pension, endowment and sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies, as well as other institutional and individual investors. As of December 31, 2024, we had total AUM of $751 billion. \nThe credit and equity investing strategies of our Asset Management segment reflect the range of investment capabilities across our platform, from investment grade to private equity. As an asset manager, we earn fees for providing investment management services and expertise to our client base. The amount of fees charged for managing these assets depends on the underlying investment strategy, liquidity profile, and, ultimately, our ability to generate returns for our clients. We also earn capital solutions fees as part of our growing capital solutions business and as part of monitoring and deployment activity alongside our sizeable private equity franchise. After expenses, we call the resulting earnings stream “Fee Related Earnings” or “FRE”, which represents the primary performance measure for the Asset Management segment.\nCredit\nCredit is our largest asset management strategy with $616 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2024. Our credit strategy spans third-party strategies and Apollo’s retirement services business across four main investment pillars: direct origination, asset-backed, multi credit and opportunistic credit. Our credit strategy provides flexible, scaled and diverse capital solutions across the entire credit risk-return spectrum, with a focus on generating excess returns through high-quality credit underwriting and origination. Beyond participation in the traditional issuance and secondary credit markets, through our origination platforms and corporate solutions capabilities we seek to originate attractive and safe-yielding assets for the investors in the funds we manage.\nEquity\nOur equity strategy managed $135 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2024. Across our equity strategy, we maintain our focus on creative structuring and sourcing while working with the management teams of the portfolio companies of the Apollo-managed funds to help transform and grow their businesses. Our flexible mandate and purchase price discipline allow us to embrace complexity and seek attractive outcomes for our stakeholders. Apollo’s equity team has experience across sectors, industries, and geographies spanning its private equity, hybrid value, secondaries equity, AAA, real estate equity, impact investing, infrastructure and clean transition equity strategies. We have consistently produced attractive long-term investment returns in the traditional private equity funds we manage, generating a 39% gross IRR and a 24% net IRR on a compound annual basis from inception through December 31, 2024.\n66\nTable of Contents\nRetirement Services\n \nOur retirement services business is conducted by Athene, a leading financial services company that specializes in issuing, reinsuring and acquiring retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs. Athene’s primary product line is annuities, which include fixed, payout and group annuities issued in conjunction with pension group annuity transactions. Athene also offers funding agreements, which are comprised of funding agreements issued under its FABN program, secured and other funding agreements, funding agreements issued to the FHLB and repurchase agreements with an original maturity exceeding one year. Our asset management business provides a full suite of services for Athene’s investment portfolio, including direct investment management, asset allocation, mergers and acquisitions asset diligence and certain operational support services, including investment compliance, tax, legal and risk management support. \nOur retirement services business focuses on generating spread income by combining the two core competencies of (1) sourcing long-term, persistent liabilities and (2) using the global scale and reach of our asset management business to actively source or originate assets with Athene’s preferred risk and return characteristics. Athene’s investment philosophy is to invest a portion of its assets in securities that earn an incremental yield by taking measured liquidity and complexity risk and capitalize on its long-dated, persistent liability profile to prudently achieve higher net investment earned rates, rather than assuming incremental credit risk. A cornerstone of Athene’s investment philosophy is that given the operating leverage inherent in its business, modest investment outperformance can translate to outsized return performance. Because Athene maintains discipline in underwriting attractively priced liabilities, it has the ability to invest in a broad range of high-quality assets to generate attractive earnings.\nPrincipal Investing\n \nOur Principal Investing segment is comprised of our realized performance fee income, realized investment income from our balance sheet investments, and certain allocable expenses related to corporate functions supporting the entire company. The Principal Investing segment also includes our growth capital and liquidity resources at AGM. Over time, we may deploy capital into strategic investments over time that will help accelerate the growth of our Asset Management segment, by broadening our investment management and/or product distribution capabilities or increasing the efficiency of our operations. We believe these investments may translate into greater compounded annual growth of Fee Related Earnings.\nGiven the cyclical nature of performance fees, earnings from our Principal Investing segment, or PII, are inherently more volatile in nature than earnings from the Asset Management and Retirement Services segments. We earn fees based on the investment performance of the funds we manage and compensate our employees, primarily investment professionals, with a meaningful portion of these proceeds to align our team with the investors in the funds we manage and incentivize them to deliver strong investment performance over time. To enhance this alignment, we have increased the proportion of performance fee income we pay to our employees over the last few years.\n67\nTable of Contents\nThe diagram below depicts our current organizational structure:\nNote: The organizational structure chart above depicts a simplified version of the Apollo structure. It does not include all legal entities in the structure. \n(1)\nIncludes direct and indirect ownership by AGM.\nBusiness Environment \nEconomic and Market Conditions\nOur asset management and retirement services businesses are affected by the condition of global financial markets and the economy. Price fluctuations within equity, credit, commodity and foreign exchange markets, as well as interest rates and global inflation, which may be volatile and mixed across geographies, can significantly impact the performance of our business, including, but not limited to, the valuation of investments, including those of the funds we manage, and related income we may recognize.\nAdverse economic conditions may result from domestic and global economic and political developments, including plateauing or decreasing economic growth and business activity, changes to U.S. and foreign tariff policies, civil unrest, geopolitical tensions or military action, such as the armed conflicts in the Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia, and corresponding sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other countries, and new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements on business investment, hiring, migration, labor supply and global supply chains.\nWe carefully monitor economic and market conditions that could potentially give rise to global market volatility and affect our business operations, investment portfolios and derivatives, which include global inflation. U.S. inflation eased in 2024 with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that the annual U.S. inflation rate decreased to 2.9% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 3.4% as of December 31, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve finished the year with a benchmark interest rate target range of 4.25% to 4.50%, marking the second sequential quarter with a significant cut in rates since the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEquity market performance was strong in 2024. In the U.S., the S&P 500 Index increased by 23.3% in 2024, following an increase of 24.2% in 2023. Global equity markets also increased in 2024, with the MSCI All Country World ex USA Index increasing by 5.3%, following an increase of 18.6% in 2023.\nConditions in the credit markets also have a significant impact on our business. Credit markets were positive in 2024, with the BofAML HY Master II Index increasing by 8.2%, while the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index increased by 8.7%.\n68\nTable of Contents\nIn terms of economic conditions in the U.S., the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.8% in 2024, following an increase of 2.9% in 2023. As of January 2025, the International Monetary Fund estimated that the U.S. economy will expand by 2.7% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. unemployment rate increased to 4.1% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 3.8% as of December 31, 2023.\nForeign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments and those of the funds we manage that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar strengthened in 2024 compared to the euro and the British pound. Relative to the U.S. dollar, the euro depreciated 6.2% in 2024, after appreciating 3.1% in 2023, while the British pound depreciated 1.7% during 2024, after appreciating 5.4% in 2023. Oil finished 2024 in line with 2023, increasing 0.1% from 2023.\nWe are actively monitoring the developments in Ukraine resulting from the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the economic sanctions and restrictions imposed against Russia, Belarus, and certain Russian and Belarussian entities and individuals. The Company continues to (i) identify and assess any exposure to designated persons or entities across the Company’s business; (ii) ensure existing surveillance and controls are calibrated to the evolving sanctions; and (iii) ensure appropriate levels of communication across the Company, and with other relevant market participants, as appropriate.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the funds we manage have no investments that would cause Apollo or any Apollo managed fund to be in violation of current international sanctions, and we believe the direct exposure of investment portfolios of the funds we manage to Russia and Ukraine is insignificant. The Company and the funds we manage do not intend to make any new material investments in Russia, and have appropriate controls in place to ensure review of any new exposure.\nInstitutional investors continue to allocate capital towards alternative investment managers in search of more attractive returns, and we believe the business environment remains generally accommodative to raise larger successor funds, launch new products, and pursue attractive strategic growth opportunities.\nInterest Rate Environment\nMedium and long-term rates increased in 2024, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield at 4.58% as of December 31, 2024 compared to 3.88% as of December 31, 2023. Short-term rates decreased in 2024, with the 3-month secured overnight financing rate at 4.31% as of December 31, 2024 compared to 5.33% as of December 31, 2023.\nWith respect to Retirement Services, Athene’s investment portfolio consists predominantly of fixed maturity investments. If prevailing interest rates were to rise, we believe the yield on Athene’s new investment purchases may also rise and its investment income from floating rate investments would increase, while the value of its existing investments may decline. If prevailing interest rates were to decline significantly, the yield on Athene’s new investment purchases may decline and its investment income from floating rate investments would decrease, while the value of its existing investments may increase. \nAthene addresses interest rate risk through managing the duration of the liabilities it sources with assets it acquires through asset liability management (“ALM”) modeling. As part of its investment strategy, Athene purchases floating rate investments, which are expected to perform well in a rising interest rate environment and are expected to underperform in a declining rate environment. Athene manages its interest rate risk in a declining rate environment through hedging activity or the issuance of additional floating rate liabilities to lower its overall net floating rate position. As of December 31, 2024, Athene’s net invested asset portfolio included $50.6 billion of floating rate investments, or 20% of its net invested assets, and its net reserve liabilities included $33.6 billion of floating rate liabilities at notional, or 13% of its net invested assets, resulting in $17.0 billion of net floating rate assets, or 7% of its net invested assets.\nIf prevailing interest rates were to rise, we believe Athene’s products would be more attractive to consumers and its sales would likely increase. If prevailing interest rates were to decline, it is likely that Athene’s products would be less attractive to consumers and its sales would likely decrease. In periods of prolonged low interest rates, the net investment spread may be negatively impacted by reduced investment income to the extent that Athene is unable to adequately reduce policyholder crediting rates due to policyholder guarantees in the form of minimum crediting rates or otherwise due to market conditions. A significant majority of Athene’s deferred annuity products have crediting rates that it may reset annually upon renewal, following the expiration of the current guaranteed period. While Athene has the contractual ability to lower these crediting rates to the guaranteed minimum levels, its willingness to do so may be limited by competitive pressures. Athene’s funding agreements, other investment-type products, immediate annuities, pension group annuity obligations and life contracts provide little to no discretionary ability to change the rates of interest payable to the respective policyholder or institution.\n69\nTable of Contents\nSee “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” which includes a discussion regarding interest rate and other significant risks and our strategies for managing these risks.\nOverview of Results of Operations\nFinancial Measures under U.S. GAAP - Asset Management\nThe following discussion of financial measures under U.S. GAAP is based on Apollo’s asset management business as of December 31, 2024.\nRevenues\nManagement Fees\nThe significant growth of the assets we manage has had a positive effect on our revenues. Management fees are typically calculated based upon any of “net asset value,” “gross assets,” “adjusted par asset value,” “adjusted costs of all unrealized portfolio investments,” “capital commitments,” “invested capital,” “adjusted assets,” “capital contributions,” or “stockholders’ equity,” each as defined in the applicable limited partnership agreement and/or management agreement of the unconsolidated funds or accounts.\nAdvisory\n \nand Transaction Fees, Net\nAs a result of providing advisory services with respect to actual and potential investments, we are entitled to receive fees for transactions related to the acquisition and, in certain instances, disposition and financing of companies, some of which are portfolio companies of the funds we manage, as well as fees for ongoing monitoring of portfolio company operations and directors’ fees. We also receive advisory fees for advisory services provided to certain funds. In addition, monitoring fees are generated on certain structured portfolio company investments. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreements for certain funds, the management fee payable by the funds may be subject to a reduction based on a certain percentage (up to 100%) of such advisory and transaction fees, net of applicable broken deal costs (“Management Fee Offset”). Such amounts are presented as a reduction to advisory and transaction fees, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on advisory and transaction fees, net.\nPerformance Fees\nThe general partners of the funds we manage are entitled to an incentive return of normally up to 20% of the total returns of a fund’s capital, depending upon performance of the underlying funds and subject to preferred returns and high water marks, as applicable. Performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, are accounted for as an equity method investment, and effectively, the performance fees for any period are based upon an assumed liquidation of the funds’ assets at the reporting date, and distribution of the net proceeds in accordance with the funds’ allocation provisions. Performance fees categorized as incentive fees, which are not accounted for as an equity method investment, are deferred until fees are probable to not be significantly reversed. The majority of performance fees are comprised of performance allocations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 40% of the value of the investments of the funds we manage, on a gross basis, was determined using market-based valuation methods (\ni.e.\n, reliance on broker or listed exchange quotes) and the remaining 60% was determined primarily by comparable company and industry multiples or discounted cash flow models. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Asset Management Business—\nThe performance of the funds we manage, and our performance, may be adversely affected by the financial performance of portfolio companies of the funds we manage and the industries in which the funds we manage invest” \nfor discussion regarding certain industry-specific risks that could affect the fair value of certain of the portfolio company investments of the funds we manage.\nIn certain funds we manage, generally in our equity strategy, the Company does not earn performance fees until the investors have achieved cumulative investment returns on invested capital (including management fees and expenses) in excess of an 8% hurdle rate. Additionally, certain of the credit funds we manage have various performance fee rates and hurdle rates. Certain of the credit funds we manage allocate performance fees to the general partner in a similar manner as the equity funds. In certain funds we manage, as long as the investors achieve their priority returns, there is a catch-up formula whereby the Company earns a priority return for a portion of the return until the Company’s performance fees equate to its performance fee rate for that \n70\nTable of Contents\nfund; thereafter, the Company participates in returns from the fund at the performance fee rate. Performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, are subject to reversal to the extent that the performance fees distributed exceed the amount due to the general partner based on a fund’s cumulative investment returns. The Company recognizes potential repayment of previously received performance fees as a general partner obligation representing all amounts previously distributed to the general partner that would need to be repaid to the Apollo funds if these funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying fund’s investments as of the reporting date. The actual general partner obligation, however, would not become payable or realized until the end of a fund’s life or as otherwise set forth in the respective limited partnership agreement of the fund.\nThe table below presents an analysis of Apollo’s (i) performance fees receivable on an unconsolidated basis, (ii) unrealized performance fees and (iii) realized performance fees, inclusive of realized incentive fees:\nAs of December 31,\nPerformance Fees for the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nPerformance Fees for the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nPerformance Fees for the Year Ended December 31, 2022\n \n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nPerformance Fees Receivable on an Unconsolidated Basis\nUnrealized\nRealized\nTotal\nUnrealized\nRealized\nTotal\nUnrealized\nRealized\nTotal\nAccord and Accord+ Funds\n$\n93 \n$\n59 \n$\n34 \n$\n20 \n$\n54 \n$\n59 \n$\n— \n$\n59 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \nAIOF I and II\n57 \n18 \n39 \n— \n39 \n8 \n5 \n13 \n(5)\n27 \n22 \nANRP I, II and III\n1\n48 \n47 \n36 \n25 \n61 \n(12)\n2 \n(10)\n(66)\n3 \n(63)\nAthora\n84 \n100 \n(15)\n— \n(15)\n(18)\n— \n(18)\n40 \n— \n40 \nCredit Strategies\n113 \n87 \n1 \n112 \n113 \n4 \n83 \n87 \n(4)\n4 \n— \nEPF Funds\n1\n21 \n15 \n— \n19 \n19 \n(121)\n34 \n(87)\n(79)\n48 \n(31)\nFCI Funds\n109 \n86 \n23 \n— \n23 \n10 \n— \n10 \n(1)\n— \n(1)\nFreedom Parent Holdings\n40 \n63 \n(53)\n117 \n64 \n63 \n— \n63 \n— \n— \n— \nFund X\n199 \n1 \n198 \n— \n198 \n1 \n— \n1 \n— \n— \n— \nFund IX\n1,597 \n1,714 \n(117)\n419 \n302 \n453 \n288 \n741 \n494 \n200 \n694 \nFund VIII\n2\n23 \n111 \n(158)\n4 \n(154)\n(259)\n118 \n(141)\n(357)\n22 \n(335)\nFund VII\n— \n27 \n(26)\n27 \n1 \n(13)\n18 \n5 \n(38)\n44 \n6 \nFund VI\n31 \n22 \n— \n9 \n9 \n(3)\n8 \n5 \n(1)\n3 \n2 \nFund IV and Fund V\n1\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n30 \n(30)\n— \n— \n— \n— \nHVF I\n60 \n45 \n15 \n9 \n24 \n1 \n41 \n42 \n(62)\n116 \n54 \nHVF II\n168 \n— \n168 \n— \n168 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nMidCap Financial\n43 \n38 \n5 \n38 \n43 \n(143)\n57 \n(86)\n36 \n19 \n55 \nRedding Ridge Holdings\n164 \n118 \n45 \n35 \n80 \n27 \n34 \n61 \n(8)\n23 \n15 \nOther\n1,3\n617 \n521 \n69 \n294 \n363 \n31 \n230 \n261 \n49 \n158 \n207 \nTotal\n$\n3,467 \n$\n3,072 \n$\n264 \n$\n1,128 \n$\n1,392 \n$\n118 \n$\n888 \n$\n1,006 \n$\n(2)\n$\n667 \n$\n665 \nTotal, net of profit sharing payable\n4\n/expense\n$\n1,684 \n$\n1,507 \n$\n118 \n$\n516 \n$\n634 \n$\n(54)\n$\n335 \n$\n281 \n$\n(17)\n$\n130 \n$\n113 \n1\n As of December 31, 2024, certain funds had $213 million in general partner obligations to return previously distributed performance fees. The fair value gain on investments and income at the fund level needed to reverse the general partner obligations was $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. \n2 \nAs of December 31, 2024, the remaining investments and escrow cash of Fund VIII was valued at 86% of the fund’s unreturned capital, which was below the required escrow ratio of 115%. As a result, the fund is required to place in escrow current and future performance fee distributions to the general partner until the specified return ratio of 115% is met (at the time of a future distribution) or upon liquidation. As of December 31, 2024, Fund VIII had $138 million of gross performance fees or $80 million net of profit sharing, in escrow. With respect to Fund VIII, realized performance fees currently distributed to the general partner are limited to potential tax distributions and interest on escrow balances per the fund’s partnership agreement. Performance fees receivable as of December 31, 2024 and realized performance fees for the year ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024 include interest earned on escrow balances that is not subject to contingent repayment. \n3 \nOther includes certain SIAs. \n4 \nThere was a corresponding profit sharing payable of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, including profit sharing payable related to amounts in escrow and contingent consideration obligations of $67 million.\nThe general partners of cert\nain of the funds we manage accrue performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, when the fair value of investments exceeds the cost basis of the individual investors’ investments in the fund, including any allocable share of expenses incurred in connection with such investments, which we refer to as “high water marks.” These high water marks are applied on an individual investor basis. Certain of the funds we manage have investors with various high water marks, the achievement of which is subject to market conditions and investment performance.\nPerformance fees from certain funds we manage are subject to contingent repayment by the general partner in the event of future losses to the extent that the cumulative performance fees distributed from inception to date exceeds the amount computed as due to the general partner at the final distribution. These general partner obligations, if applicable, are included in due to related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n71\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our performance fees since inception through December 31, 2024:\nPerformance Fees Since Inception\n1\n(In millions)\nUndistributed by Fund and Recognized\nDistributed by Fund and Recognized\n2\nTotal Undistributed and Distributed by Fund and Recognized\n3\nGeneral Partner Obligation\n3\nMaximum Performance Fees Subject to Potential Reversal\n4\nAccord and Accord+ Funds\n93 \n47 \n140 \n— \n93 \nAIOF I and II\n57 \n63 \n120 \n— \n80 \nANRP I, II and III\n48 \n186 \n234 \n12 \n94 \nAthora\n84 \n— \n84 \n— \n84 \nCredit Strategies\n113 \n373 \n486 \n— \n106 \nEPF Funds\n21 \n527 \n548 \n110 \n35 \nFCI Funds\n109 \n24 \n133 \n— \n109 \nFreedom Parent Holdings\n40 \n87 \n127 \n— \n10 \nFund X\n199 \n— \n199 \n— \n199 \nFund IX\n1,597 \n1,297 \n2,894 \n— \n2,320 \nFund VIII\n23 \n1,783 \n1,806 \n70 \n1,162 \nFund VII\n— \n3,271 \n3,271 \n— \n— \nFund VI\n31 \n1,664 \n1,695 \n— \n— \nFund IV and Fund V\n— \n2,023 \n2,023 \n1 \n— \nHVF I\n60 \n252 \n312 \n— \n183 \nHVF II\n168 \n— \n168 \n— \n168 \nMidCap Financial\n43 \n166 \n209 \n— \n43 \nRedding Ridge Holdings\n164 \n— \n164 \n— \n129 \nOther\n5\n617 \n2,638 \n3,255 \n20 \n700 \nTotal\n$\n3,467 \n$\n14,401 \n$\n17,868 \n$\n213 \n$\n5,515 \n1\n Certain funds are denominated in euros and historical figures are translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of €1.00 to $1.04 as of December 31, 2024.

Amounts exclude certain performance fees from business development companies and Redding Ridge Holdings LP (“Redding Ridge Holdings”), an affiliate of Redding Ridge.\n3\n Amounts were computed based on the fair value of fund investments on December 31, 2024. Performance fees have been allocated to and recognized by the general partner. Based on the amount allocated, a portion is subject to potential reversal or, to the extent applicable, has been reduced by the general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees at December 31, 2024. The actual determination and any required payment of any such general partner obligation would not take place until the final disposition of the fund’s investments based on contractual termination of the fund.\n4\n Represents the amount of performance fees that would be reversed if remaining fund investments became worthless on December 31, 2024. Amounts subject to potential reversal of performance fees include amounts undistributed by a fund (\ni.e.\n, the performance fees receivable), as well as a portion of the amounts that have been distributed by a fund, net of taxes and not subject to a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees, except for those funds that are gross of taxes as defined in the respective funds’ governing documents.\n5\n Other includes certain SIAs.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe most significant expense in our asset management business is compensation and benefits expense. This consists of fixed salary, discretionary and non-discretionary bonuses, profit sharing expense associated with the performance fees earned and compensation expense associated with the vesting of non-cash equity-based awards.\nOur compensation arrangements with certain employees contain a significant performance-based incentive component. Therefore, as our net revenues increase, our compensation costs rise. Our compensation costs also reflect the increased investment in people as we expand geographically and create new funds.\nIn addition, certain professionals and selected other individuals have a profit sharing interest in the performance fees earned in order to better align their interests with our own and with those of the investors in the funds we manage. Profit sharing expense is part of our compensation and benefits expense and is generally based upon a fixed percentage of performance fees. Certain of \n72\nTable of Contents\nour performance-based incentive arrangements provide for compensation based on realized performance fees which includes fees earned by the general partners of the funds we manage under the applicable fund limited partnership agreements based upon transactions that have closed or other rights to incentive income cash that have become fixed in the applicable calendar year period. Profit sharing expense can reverse during periods when there is a decline in performance fees that were previously recognized. Profit sharing amounts are normally distributed to employees after the corresponding investment gains have been realized and generally before preferred returns are achieved for the investors. Therefore, changes in our unrealized performance fees have the same effect on our profit sharing expense. Profit sharing expense increases when unrealized performance fees increase. Realizations only impact profit sharing expense to the extent that the effects on investments have not been recognized previously. If losses on other investments within a fund are subsequently realized, the profit sharing amounts previously distributed are normally subject to a general partner obligation to return performance fees previously distributed back to the funds. This general partner obligation due to the funds would be realized only when the fund is liquidated, which generally occurs at the end of the fund’s term. However, indemnification obligations also exist for realized gains with respect to certain funds, which, although our Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners would remain personally liable, may indemnify our Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners for 17.5% to 100% of the previously distributed profits regardless of the fund’s future performance. See note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s indemnification liability.\nThe Company grants equity awards to certain employees, including RSUs and restricted shares of common stock, that generally vest and become exercisable in quarterly installments or annual installments depending on the award terms. In some instances, vesting of an RSU is also subject to the Company’s receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods, sufficient to cover the associated equity-based compensation expense. See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of equity-based compensation.\nOther expenses\nThe balance of our other expenses includes interest, placement fees, and general, administrative and other operating expenses. Interest expense consists primarily of interest related to the senior and subordinated notes as discussed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Placement fees are incurred in connection with our capital raising activities. In cases where the limited partners of the funds are determined to be the customer in an arrangement, placement fees may be capitalized as a cost to acquire a customer contract, and amortized over the life of the customer contract. General, administrative and other expenses includes occupancy expense, depreciation and amortization, professional fees and costs related to travel, information technology and administration. Occupancy expense represents charges related to office leases and associated expenses, such as utilities and maintenance fees. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets is normally calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to sixteen years, taking into consideration any residual value. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the expected term of the lease. Intangible assets are amortized based on the future cash flows over the expected useful lives of the assets.\nOther Income (Loss)\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities\nNet gains (losses) from investment activities include both realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses in our investment portfolio between the opening reporting date and the closing reporting date. Net unrealized gains (losses) are a result of changes in the fair value of unrealized investments and reversal of unrealized gains (losses) due to dispositions of investments during the reporting period. Significant judgment and estimation goes into the assumptions that drive these models and the actual values realized with respect to investments could be materially different from values obtained based on the use of those models. The valuation methodologies applied impact the reported value of investment company holdings and their underlying portfolios in our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”)\nChanges in the fair value of the consolidated VIEs’ assets and liabilities and related interest, dividend and other income and expenses subsequent to consolidation are presented within net gains (losses) from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities and are attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated statements of operations.\n73\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Losses), Net\nOther income (losses), net includes gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement liability and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses.\nFinancial Measures under U.S. GAAP - Retirement Services\nThe following discussion of financial measures under U.S. GAAP is based on the Company’s retirement services business, which is operated by Athene, as of December 31, 2024.\nRevenues\nPremiums\nPremiums for long-duration contracts, including products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. Insurance revenues are reported net of reinsurance ceded.\nProduct charges\nRevenues for universal life-type policies and investment contracts, including surrender and market value adjustments, costs of insurance, policy administration, GMDB, GLWB and no-lapse guarantee charges, are earned when assessed against policyholder account balances during the period.\nNet investment income\nNet investment income is a significant component of Athene’s total revenues. Athene recognizes investment income as it accrues or is legally due, net of investment management and custody fees. Investment income on fixed maturity securities includes coupon interest, as well as the amortization of any premium and the accretion of any discount. Investment income on equity securities represents dividend income and preferred coupon interest.\nInvestment related gains (losses)\nInvestment related gains (losses) primarily consist of (i) realized gains and losses on sales of investments, (ii) unrealized gains or losses relating to identified risks within AFS securities in fair value hedging relationships, (iii) gains and losses on trading securities, (iv) gains and losses on equity securities, (v) changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and derivatives not designated as a hedge, (vi) changes in the fair value of mortgage loan assets and (vii) changes in the provision for credit losses.\nExpenses\nInterest sensitive contract benefits\nUniversal life-type policies and investment contracts include traditional deferred annuities; indexed annuities consisting of fixed indexed, index-linked variable annuities in the accumulation phase, and assumed indexed universal life without significant mortality risk; funding agreements; immediate annuities without significant mortality risk (which include pension group annuities without life contingencies); universal life insurance; and other investment contracts inclusive of assumed endowments without significant mortality risk. Liabilities for traditional deferred annuities, indexed annuities, funding agreements and universal life insurance are carried at the account balances without reduction for potential surrender or withdrawal charges, except for a block of universal life business ceded to Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “Global Atlantic”), which is carried at fair value. Fixed indexed annuity, index-linked variable annuity and indexed universal life insurance contracts contain an embedded derivative. Benefit reserves for these contracts are reported as the sum of the fair value of the embedded derivative and the host (or guaranteed) component of the contracts. The fair value of the embedded derivatives represents the present value of cash flows attributable to the indexed strategies. The host contract is established at contract inception as the initial account value less the initial fair value of the embedded derivative and accreted over the policy’s life. Liabilities for immediate annuities without significant mortality risk are calculated as the present value of future liability cash flows and policy maintenance expenses discounted at contractual interest rates. Certain contracts are offered with additional contract features that meet the definition of a market risk benefit. See “—Market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) \n74\nTable of Contents\nlosses” below for further information.\nChanges in interest sensitive contract liabilities, excluding deposits and withdrawals, are recorded in interest sensitive contract benefits or product charges on the consolidated statements of operations. \nFuture policy and other policy benefits\nAthene issues or reinsures contracts classified as long-duration, which include term and whole life, accident and health, disability, and deferred and immediate annuities with life contingencies (which include pension group annuities with life contingencies).\nLiabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established as the estimated present value of benefits Athene expects to pay to or on behalf of the policyholder and related expenses less the present value of the net premiums to be collected, referred to as the net premium ratio. Liabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods which require the use of assumptions related to discount rate, expenses, longevity, mortality, morbidity, persistency and other policyholder behavior. The liability for nonparticipating long-duration contracts is discounted using an upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yield aligned to the characteristics of the liability, including the duration and currency of the underlying cash flows.\nChanges in the value of the liability for nonparticipating long-duration contracts due to changes in the discount rate are recognized as a component of OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the liability for remeasurement gains or losses and all other changes in the liability are recorded in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations.\nFuture policy benefits include liabilities for no-lapse guarantees on universal life insurance and fixed indexed universal life insurance. Each reporting period, expected excess benefits and assessments are updated with actual excess benefits and assessments. Athene also periodically revises the key assumptions used in the calculation of the liabilities that result in revisions to the expected excess benefits and assessments. The effects of changes in assumptions are recorded as unlocking in the period in which the changes are made. Changes in the liabilities associated with no-lapse guarantees are recorded in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations.\nMarket risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses\nMarket risk benefits represent contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contract holder from, and expose the insurance entity to, other-than-nominal capital market risk. Athene’s deferred annuity contracts contain GLWB and GMDB riders that meet the criteria for, and are classified as, market risk benefits.\nMarket risk benefits are measured at fair value at the contract level and may be recorded as a liability or an asset, which are included in market risk benefits or other assets, respectively, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees and assessments collectible from the policyholder at contract inception are allocated to the extent they are attributable to the market risk benefit. If the fees are sufficient to cover the projected benefits, a non-option based valuation model is used. If the fees are insufficient to cover the projected benefits, an option-based valuation model is used to compute the market risk benefit liability at contract inception, with an equal and offsetting adjustment recognized in interest sensitive contract liabilities.\nChanges in fair value of market risk benefits are recorded in market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses on the consolidated statements of operations, excluding portions attributed to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, which are recorded in OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Ceded market risk benefits are measured at fair value and recorded within reinsurance recoverable on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements, and value of business acquired\nCosts related directly to the successful acquisition of new, or the renewal of existing, insurance or investment contracts are deferred. These costs consist of commissions and policy issuance costs, as well as sales inducements credited to policyholder account balances, and are included in deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n75\nTable of Contents\nDeferred costs related to universal life-type policies and investment contracts with significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are grouped into cohorts based on issue year and contract type and amortized on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts. The cohorts and assumptions used for the amortization of deferred costs are consistent with those used in estimating the related liabilities for these contracts. Deferred costs related to investment contracts without significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are amortized using the effective interest method. The effective interest method amortizes the deferred costs by discounting the future liability cash flows at a break-even rate. The break-even rate is solved for such that the present value of future liability cash flows is equal to the net liability at the inception of the contract. VOBA associated with acquired contracts can be either positive or negative and is amortized in relation to respective policyholder liabilities. Significant assumptions that impact VOBA amortization are consistent with those that impact the measurement of policyholder liabilities.\nAmortization of DAC, DSI and VOBA is included in amortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of operations.\nPolicy and other operating expenses\nPolicy and other operating expenses include normal operating expenses, policy acquisition expenses, interest expense, dividends to policyholders, integration, restructuring and other non-operating expenses and stock compensation expenses.\nOther Financial Measures under U.S. GAAP \nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating income tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We recognize the income tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the positions. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. The Company’s income tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether or not we have uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition or de-recognition.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences, using currently enacted tax rates, of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nFor entities that are consolidated, but not 100% owned, a portion of the income or loss and corresponding equity is allocated to owners other than Apollo. The aggregate of the income or loss and corresponding equity that is not owned by the Company is included in non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. Non-controlling interests primarily include limited partner interests in certain consolidated funds and VIEs.\nThe authoritative guidance for non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements requires reporting entities to present non-controlling interest as equity and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and non-controlling interests. According to the guidance, (1) non-controlling interests are presented as a separate component of stockholders’ equity on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition, (2) net income (loss) includes the net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest holders on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, and (3) profits and losses are allocated to non-controlling interests in proportion to their ownership interests regardless of their basis.\n76\nTable of Contents\nManaging Business Performance - Key Segment and Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures \nWe believe that the presentation of Segment Income supplements a reader’s understanding of the economic operating performance of each of our segments.\nSegment Income and Adjusted Net Income\nSegment Income is the key performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of the Asset Management, Retirement Services, and Principal Investing segments. See note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of Segment Income and management’s consideration of Segment Income.\nWe believe that Segment Income is helpful for an understanding of our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance. This measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed above in “—Overview of Results of Operations” that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nAdjusted Net Income (“ANI”) represents Segment Income less HoldCo interest and other financing costs and estimated income taxes. For purposes of calculating the Adjusted Net Income tax rate, Segment Income is reduced by HoldCo interest and financing costs. Income taxes on FRE and PII represents the total current corporate, local, and non-U.S. taxes as well as the current payable under Apollo’s tax receivable agreement. Income taxes on FRE and PII excludes the impacts of deferred taxes and the remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement, which arise from changes in estimated future tax rates. Certain assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied FRE and PII income tax provision are similar to those used under U.S. GAAP. Specifically, certain deductions considered in the income tax provision under U.S. GAAP relating to transaction related charges, equity-based compensation, and tax deductible interest expense are taken into account for the implied tax provision. Income Taxes on SRE represent the total current and deferred tax expense or benefit on income before taxes adjusted to eliminate the impact of the tax expense or benefit associated with the non-operating adjustments. Management believes the methodologies used to compute income taxes on FRE, SRE, and PII are meaningful to each segment and increases comparability of income taxes between periods.\nFee Related Earnings, Spread Related Earnings and Principal Investing Income\nFee Related Earnings, or “FRE”, is a component of Segment Income that is used to assess the performance of the Asset Management segment.\nSpread Related Earnings, or “SRE”, is a component of Segment Income that is used to assess the performance of the Retirement Services segment, excluding certain market volatility, which consists of investment gains (losses), net of offsets and non-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives, and certain expenses related to integration, restructuring, equity-based compensation, and other expenses.\nNon-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives includes the change in fair values of derivatives and embedded derivatives, non-operating change in funding agreements, change in fair value of market risk benefits, and non-operating change in liability for future policy benefits.\nPrincipal Investing Income, or “PII”, is a component of Segment Income that is used to assess the performance of the Principal Investing segment. \nSee note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of FRE, SRE, and PII.\nWe use Segment Income, ANI, FRE, SRE and PII as measures of operating performance, not as measures of liquidity. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The use of these measures without consideration of their related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described above.\nNet Invested Assets\nIn managing its business, Athene analyzes net invested assets, which does not correspond to total Athene investments, including investments in related parties, as disclosed in the consolidated statements of financial condition and notes thereto. Net invested \n77\nTable of Contents\nassets represent the investments that directly back Athene’s net reserve liabilities as well as surplus assets. Net invested assets is used in the computation of net investment earned rate, which is used to analyze the profitability of Athene’s investment portfolio. Net invested assets include (a) total investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition with AFS securities, trading securities and mortgage loans at cost or amortized cost, excluding derivatives, (b) cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, (c) investments in related parties, (d) accrued investment income, (e) VIE and VOE assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest adjustments, (f) net investment payables and receivables, (g) policy loans ceded (which offset the direct policy loans in total investments) and (h) an adjustment for the allowance for credit losses. Net invested assets exclude the derivative collateral offsetting the related cash positions. Athene includes the underlying investments supporting its assumed funds withheld and modco agreements and excludes the underlying investments related to ceded reinsurance transactions in its net invested assets calculation in order to match the assets with the income received. Athene believes the adjustments for reinsurance provide a view of the assets for which it has economic exposure. Net invested assets include Athene’s proportionate share of ACRA investments, based on its economic ownership, but do not include the proportionate share of investments associated with the non-controlling interests. Net invested assets are averaged over the number of quarters in the relevant period to compute a net investment earned rate for such period. While Athene believes net invested assets is a meaningful financial metric and enhances the understanding of the underlying drivers of its investment portfolio, it should not be used as a substitute for Athene’s total investments, including related parties, presented under U.S. GAAP.\nResults of Operations\nBelow is a discussion of our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

The increase in investment income in 2024 was driven by an increase in performance allocations of $304 million, partially offset by a decrease in principal investment income of $31 million.\nSignificant drivers for performance allocations in 2024 were performance allocations primarily earned from Fund IX, Fund X, HVF II, Credit Strategies, Redding Ridge Holdings and Freedom Parent Holdings of $302 million, $198 million, $168 million, $113 million, $80 million and $64 million, respectively, partially offset by performance allocation losses from Fund VIII of $154 million.\nSee below for details on the respective performance allocations in 2024.\nThe performance allocations earned from Fund IX in 2024 were primarily driven by the appreciation and realization of the fund’s investments in the (i) manufacturing and industrial and (ii) leisure sectors, and the fund’s distressed investments. \nThe performance allocations earned from Fund X in 2024 were primarily driven by the appreciation and realization of the fund’s investments in the (i) consumer and retail and (ii) manufacturing and industrial sectors, and the fund’s distressed investments. Moreover, the fund achieved its annualized hurdle rate in 2024.\nThe performance allocations earned from HVF II in 2024 were primarily driven by the appreciation and realization of the fund’s investments in private portfolio companies in the (i) consumer services, (ii) consumer and retail and (iii) manufacturing and industrial sectors. Moreover, the fund achieved its annualized hurdle rate in 2024. \nThe performance allocations earned from Credit Strategies in 2024 were driven by the net income generated by the fund’s investments.\nThe performance allocations earned from Redding Ridge Holdings in 2024 were primarily driven by existing and new CLO issuances, CLO contract acquisitions, new consulting contracts and the accumulation of warehouse assets.\nThe performance allocations earned from Freedom Parent Holdings in 2024 were primarily driven by the appreciation of its investment in Wheels, a U.S. corporate fleet lessor platform.\nThe performance allocation losses from Fund VIII in 2024 were primarily driven by the depreciation of the fund’s investments in the (i) media, telecom and technology, (ii) consumer services and (iii) leisure sectors.\nAdvisory and transaction fees increased by $199 million to $822 million in 2024 from $623 million in 2023. Advisory and transaction fees earned during 2024 were primarily attributable to advisory and transaction fees earned from companies in the (i) media, telecom and technology, (ii) financial services, (iii) manufacturing and industrial, (iv) business services and (v) natural resources sectors.\n80\nTable of Contents\nManagement fees increased by $127 million to $1.9 billion in 2024 from $1.8 billion in 2023. The increase in management fees in 2024 was primarily attributable to management fees earned from Atlas, ADS and S3 Equity and Hybrid Solutions, L.P. of $58 million, $52 million and $20 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from Fund X of $21 million. The increase in management fees earned from Atlas, ADS and S3 Equity and Hybrid Solutions, L.P. was driven by an increase in the management fee basis, an increase in subscriptions and higher fee-generating AUM due to additional closes in 2024, respectively. The decrease in management fees earned from Fund X of $21 million was primarily related to the catch-up management fees earned in 2023.\nExpenses\nExpenses were $4.0 billion in 2024, an increase of $265 million from $3.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to increases in general, administrative and other and interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in total compensation and benefits expenses. General, administrative and other expenses were $1.2 billion in 2024, an increase of $298 million from $872 million in 2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily driven by $72 million related to equity interests issued by a subsidiary as part of a restructuring of such entity, as well as $18 million of fund merger-related costs. Additionally, increases in professional fees, higher travel and entertainment expenses and placement fees also contributed to the higher general, administrative and other expenses in 2024.\nInterest expense was $226 million in 2024, an increase of $81 million from $145 million in 2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily driven by higher interest rates from debt issuances offset, in part, by debt repayments in 2024.\nTotal compensation and benefits were $2.6 billion in 2024, a decrease of $114 million from $2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in equity-based compensation of $267 million, partially offset by increases in salary, bonus and benefits and profit sharing expense of $113 million and $40 million, respectively. The decrease in equity-based compensation of $267 million was primarily due to special fully vested RSUs that were granted to certain senior leaders in 2023. Equity-based compensation expense, in any given period, is generally comprised of: (i) performance grants which are tied to the Company’s receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods and are typically recognized on an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period to the extent the performance revenue metrics are met or deemed probable, and (ii) the impact of the 2021 one-time grants awarded to the then Co-Presidents of AAM, all of which vest on a cliff basis subject to continued employment over five years, and a portion of which also vest on the Company’s achievement of FRE and SRE per share metrics. \nThe increase in salary, bonus and benefits of $113 million was primarily driven by the growth in revenues and increased headcount in 2024. Additionally, there was an increase in profit sharing expense of $40 million resulting from the corresponding higher investment income during 2024. In any period, the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance allocations in the period.\nOther Income (Loss)\nOther income (loss) was $303 million in 2024, an increase of $30 million from $273 million in 2023. This increase was driven by increases in net gains (losses) from investment activities and other income (loss), net of $51 million and $19 million, respectively, offset, in part, by a decrease in net gains (losses) from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities of $40 million. See note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our consolidated variable interest entities.\nThe increase in net gains (losses) \nfrom investment activities\n of \n$51 million was primarily driven by the appreciation in the Company’s investment in Global Business Travel Group, Inc. The increase in other income (loss) of $19 million was primarily attributable to derivative gains and gains from changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, partially offset by an increase in earnout expense associated with a previous acquisition and losses associated with the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.\n81\nTable of Contents\nRetirement Services\nRevenues\nRetirement Services revenues were $21.9 billion in 2024, a decrease of $7.2 billion from $29.1 billion in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in premiums and a decrease in other revenues, partially offset by an increase in net investment income, an increase in investment related gains (losses) and an increase in revenues of consolidated VIEs.\nPremiums were $1.3 billion in 2024, a decrease of $11.4 billion from $12.7 billion in 2023, primarily \ndriven by a $9.5 billion decrease in pension group annuity premiums compared to \n2023 and a decrease in premiums attributable to the execution of a whole life block reinsurance transaction in the fourth quarter of 2023\n.\nOther revenues were $19 million in 2024, a decrease of $572 million\n from \n$591 million\n in \n2023, primarily due to the $555 million gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023.\nNet investment income was $15.7 billion in 2024, an increase of $3.6 billion from $12.1 billion in 2023, primarily driven by significant growth in Athene’s investment portfolio attributable to strong net flows in 2024 and higher rates on new deployment in comparison to Athene’s existing portfolio related to the higher interest rate environment.\nInvestment related gains (losses) were $2.0 billion in 2024, an increase of $617 million from $1.4 billion in 2023, primarily due to favorable net foreign exchange impacts, a favorable change in the fair value of FIA hedging derivatives and the fair value of Athene’s strategic modco reinsurance agreement with Catalina, involving the cession of certain inforce funding agreements, and a favorable change in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by an unfavorable change in fair value of reinsurance assets. The favorable net foreign exchange impacts were primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2024 compared to 2023. The change in fair value of FIA hedging derivatives increased \n$356 million\n, primarily driven by the favorable performance of the equity indices upon which Athene’s call options are based, with the 2024 impact amplified by the strong growth in Athene’s FIA block of business over the previous twelve months. The largest percentage of Athene’s call options are based on the S&P 500 Index, which increased 23.3% in 2024, compared to an increase of 24.2% in 2023.\n \nThe favorable change in the provision for credit losses of $154 million was primarily driven by intent-to-sell impairments in 2023 related to the timing of the recapture of certain business by VIAC and impacts from the Silicon Valley Bank failure. The change in fair value of reinsurance assets decreased $932 million, primarily driven by an increase in U.S. Treasury rates in 2024 compared to a decrease in 2023. \nRevenues of consolidated VIEs were $1.8 billion in 2024, an increase of $381 million from $1.4 billion in 2023, primarily driven by gains within AAA related to favorable returns on the underlying assets.\nExpenses\nRetirement Services expenses were $15.0 billion in 2024, a decrease of $8.6 billion from $23.6 billion in 2023. The decrease was driven by a decrease in future policy and other policy benefits and a decrease in market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses, partially offset by an increase in interest sensitive contract benefits, an increase in policy and other operating expenses and an increase in \nDAC, DSI and VOBA amortization\n. Athene’s annual unlocking of assumptions resulted in an increase in total expenses of $31 million compared to a decrease of $22 million in 2023. The 2024 unlocking was driven by an increase of $62 million in market risk benefits, an increase of $21 million related to DAC, DSI and VOBA and an increase of $8 million in interest sensitive contract benefits, partially offset by a decrease of $60 million in future policy and other policy benefits, compared to a decrease of $94 million in interest sensitive contract benefits and a decrease of $45 million in future policy and other policy benefits, partially offset by an increase of $81 million in market risk benefits and an increase of $36 million related to DAC, DSI and VOBA in 2023.\nFuture policy and other policy benefits were $3.1 billion in 2024, a decrease of $11.4 billion from $14.4 billion in 2023, \nprimarily driven by a $9.5 billion\n \ndecrease\n in pension group annuity obligation\ns compared to \n2023, a decrease in life reserves due to the execution of a $2.2 billion whole life block reinsurance transaction in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a favorable change in unlocking\n, partially offset by a \n$207 million\n increase in accrued interest. \nUnlocking in 2024 was $60 million favorable consisting of $104 million of favorable future policy benefit reserve unlocking, partially offset by $44 million of unfavorable negative VOBA and deferred profit liability unlocking. The favorable unlocking primarily related to favorable projected mortality lowering future benefit payments, partially offset by an increase in the lump sum payment utilization assumption. Unlocking in 2023 was $45 million favorable consisting of $297 million of favorable future policy benefit reserve \n82\nTable of Contents\nunlocking, partially offset by $252 million of unfavorable negative VOBA and deferred profit liability unlocking. The favorable unlocking primarily related to higher interest rates and favorable mortality experience lowering future benefit payments.\nMarket risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses were $(102) million in 2024, a decrease of $506 million from $404 million in 2023. The gains in 2024 compared to losses in 2023 were \nprimarily driven by a favorable change in the fair value of market risk benefits and a \nfavorable\n change in unlocking, partially offset by a $44 million increase in accrued interest. The change in fair value of market risk benefits was $567 million favorable compar\ned to 2023 due to an increase in t\nhe risk-free discount rate across the curve, which is used in the fair value measurement of the liability for market risk benefits. This impact was partially offset by an unfavorable change in the fair value of market risk benefits of \n$25 million related to less favorable equity market performance compared to 2023. The market risk benefits unlocking in 2024 was $62 million unfavorable primarily due to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims, partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and enhanced income utilization assumptions, while 2023 unlocking was $81 million unfavorable primarily due to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims, partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and income rider restart assumptions.\nInterest sensitive contract benefits were $8.9 billion \nin 2024, an increase of $2.7 billion from $6.2 billion in 2023, primarily driven by significant growth in Athene’s deferred annuity and funding agreement blocks of business, higher rates on new deferred annuity and funding agreement issuances in comparison to its existing blocks of business and an unfavorable change in unlocking, partially offset by a decrease in the change in fair value of FIA embedded derivatives. The decrease in the change in fair value of FIA embedded derivatives of $1.3 billion was primarily due to the favorable change in discount rates used in Athene’s embedded derivative calculations as 2024 experienced an increase in discount rates compared to a decrease in 2023. This was partially offset by the favorable performance of the equity indices to which Athene’s FIA policies are linked, with the 2024 impact amplified by the strong growth in Athene’s FIA block of business over the previous twelve months. The largest percentage of Athene’s FIA policies are linked to the S&P 500 Index, which increased 23.3% in 2024, compared to an increase of 24.2% in 2023. The fair value of FIA embedded derivatives unlocking in 2024 was $67 million unfavorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, while 2023 unlocking was $20 million favorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, partially offset by an increase in lapse and risk margin assumptions. The negative VOBA unlocking related to Athene’s interest sensitive contract liabilities in 2024 was $59 million favorable mainly due to updated economics and an increase in lapse assumptions, while 2023\n \nunlocking was $74 million favorable mainly due to an increase in lapse assumptions. \nPolicy and other operating expenses were $2.1 billion in 2024, an increase of $299 million from $1.8 billion in 2023, primarily driven by $152 million of expense related to guaranty association assessments levied against Athene in connection with the Bankers Life Insurance Company and Colorado Bankers Life Insurance Company insolvencies and an increase in interest expense. Additionally, policy and other operating expenses increased due to an increase in policy acquisition expenses related to significant volume growth in 2024.\nDAC, DSI and VOBA amortization was $941 million in \n2024, an increase of \n$253 million from $688 million in \n2023\n, primarily due to strong growth in Athene’s retail channel in \n2024\n, partially offset by a favorable change in unlocking. Unlocking in \n2024\n was \n$21 million unfavorable \nmainly related to changes\n to projected interest crediting and an increase in lapse assumptions,\n while unlocking in \n2023\n was $36 million unfavorable mainly related to an increase in lapse assumptions and changes to projected interest crediting.\nIncome Tax (Provision) Benefit\nThe Company’s income tax (provision) benefit totaled $(1,062) million and $923 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change to the provision was primarily related to the increase in pretax income subject to income tax and a one-time deferred tax benefit resulting from the enactment of the Bermuda CIT in the fourth quarter of 2023. The (provision) benefit for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign income taxes resulting in an effective income tax rate of 14.3% and (16.5)% for 2024 and 2023, respectively. The most significant reconciling items between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the effective income tax rate were due to the following: (i) foreign, state and local income taxes, including NYC UBT, (ii) income attributable to non-controlling interests, (iii) equity-based compensation net of the limiting provisions for executive compensation under IRC Section 162(m), and (iv) a change in the estimated deferred tax benefit recorded for the Bermuda CIT. The Company does not expect a material increase to its consolidated effective tax rate or earnings and results of operations as a result of the utilization of the deferred tax assets, though the Company can provide no assurance that the impacts will not be material in future years. See note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the Company’s income tax (provision) benefit. \n83\nTable of Contents\nSegment Analysis \nDiscussed below are our results of operations for each of our reportable segments.

This increase was primarily attributable to growth in fee related revenues, including management fees, capital solutions fees and other, net and fee-related performance fees. \nThe increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from Athene and ADS of $237 million and $45 million, respectively, driven by increases in fee-generating AUM and increased subscriptions in 2024, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from Fund X of $21 million, primarily related to the catch-up management fees earned in 2023. Equity management fees included Fund X catch-up management fees of $45 million in 2023.\nCapital solutions fees in 2024 were primarily attributable to fees earned from companies in the (i) media, telecom and technology, (ii) financial services, (iii) manufacturing and industrial and (iv) business services sectors. \nThe increase in fee-related performance fees in 2024 was primarily attributable to fees earned from ADS of $54 million, reflecting the growing contribution from Apollo’s wealth-focused products. \nThe growth in revenues was offset, in part, by increases in non-compensation expenses and fee-related compensation expense. The increase in non-compensation expenses in 2024 was primarily driven by increases in travel and entertainment expenses, placement fees, depreciation and amortization expenses and higher professional fees. In addition, non-compensation expenses in 2024 included fund merger-related costs of $15 million. The increase in fee-related compensation was driven by corresponding growth in fee related revenues and increased headcount in 2024. \n84\nTable of Contents\nAsset Management Operating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the alternative asset management industry and directly impact the performance of our Asset Management segment.

The net increase was primarily driven by the growth of our retirement services client assets, market activity primarily in our credit strategy, and subscriptions across the platform, partially offset by outflows attributable to Atlas. More specifically, the net increase was due to:\n•\nNet flows of $61.7 billion primarily attributable to a $57.8 billion increase related to the funds we manage in our credit strategy primarily consisting of (i) a $34.7 billion increase related to the growth of our retirement services client assets; (ii) $18.3 billion of other net fee-generating movements; and (iii) $15.1 billion of subscriptions primarily related to the direct origination and multi-credit funds we manage, partially offset by $(7.0) billion of outflows resulting from the previously announced conclusion of the Atlas SP-Credit Suisse investment management agreement.\n•\nMarket activity of $21.7 billion primarily attributable to the funds we manage in our credit strategy consisting of $14.8 billion related to our retirement services clients and $2.1 billion related to ISGI.\n•\nRealizations of $(7.7) billion across the credit and equity strategies. \nOrigination, Gross Capital Deployment and Uncalled Commitments\nOrigination represents (i) capital that has been invested in new equity, debt or debt-like investments by Apollo's equity and credit strategies (whether purchased by funds and accounts managed by Apollo, or syndicated to third parties) where Apollo or one of Apollo's origination platforms has sourced, negotiated, or significantly affected the commercial terms of the investment; (ii) new capital pools formed by debt issuances, including CLOs; and (iii) net purchases of certain assets by the funds and accounts we manage that we consider to be private, illiquid, and hard to access assets and which the funds and accounts otherwise may not be able to meaningfully access. Origination generally excludes any issuance of debt or debt-like investments by the portfolio companies of the funds we manage.\nGross capital deployment represents the gross capital that has been invested by the funds and accounts we manage during the relevant period, but excludes certain investment activities primarily related to hedging and cash management functions at the Company. Gross capital deployment is not reduced or netted down by sales or refinancings, and takes into account leverage used by the funds and accounts we manage in gaining exposure to the various investments that they have made.\nUncalled commitments, by contrast, represent unfunded capital commitments that certain of the funds we manage have received from fund investors to fund future or current fund investments and expenses.\n89\nTable of Contents\nOrigination is indicative of our ability to originate assets for the funds we manage, through our origination platforms and our corporate solutions capabilities. Gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments are indicative of the pace and magnitude of fund capital that is deployed or will be deployed. Origination, gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments could result in future revenues that include management fees, capital solutions fees and performance fees to the extent they are fee-generating. They can also give rise to future costs that are related to the hiring of additional resources to manage and account for the additional origination activities and the capital that is deployed or will be deployed. Management uses origination, gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments as key operating metrics since we believe the results are measures of investment activities of the funds we manage.\nThe following presents origination, gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments (in billions):\n \n \n \nNote: Totals may not add due to rounding\n90\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Apollo had $61 billion and $58 billion of dry powder, respectively, which represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment subject to the provisions of the applicable limited partnership agreements or other governing agreements of the funds, partnerships and accounts we manage.

The increase in SRE was primarily driven by higher net investment earnings and strategic capital management fees, partially offset by higher cost of funds and interest and other financing costs. \nNet investment earnings increased $2.1 billion, primarily driven by $25.3 billion of growth in Athene’s average net invested assets, higher rates on new deployment compared to Athene’s existing portfolio related to the higher interest rate environment and an increase in alternative net investment income, partially offset by an increase in income attributable to the ACRA non-controlling interests following the sale of a 50% interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increases in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60% effective December 31, 2023 and 63% effective October 1, 2024. The increase in alternative net investment income compared to 2023 was primarily driven by more favorable performance within retirement services and strategic origination platforms, as well as credit, partially offset by less favorable performance within equity. The increase in income from retirement services platforms was primarily related to underperformance from FWD Group Holdings Limited (“FWD”) and a decrease in the share price of Challenger Limited (“Challenger”) in 2023, partially offset by increased expenses and lower growth impacting the valuation of Athora in 2024. The increase in income from strategic origination platforms was mainly attributable to unfavorable performance from Aqua Finance in 2023 related to macroeconomic headwinds for consumer loan origination, favorable performance from Foundation Home Loans driven by increased origination volumes in 2024 and strong growth within other strategic origination platforms related to the funding of investments in 2024, partially offset by outsized performance from MidCap Financial in 2023.\n91\nTable of Contents\nStrategic capital management fees increased $33 million due to additional fees received from ADIP II as a result of the sale of a 50% interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increases in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60% effective December 31, 2023 and 63% effective October 1, 2024, as well as new business ceded to ACRA 2 in 2024.\nCost of funds increased $2.1 billion, primarily driven by growth in and higher rates on new deferred annuity issuances, growth in and higher rates on new institutional business, including the additional costs of swapping to or issuing funding agreements as floating rate to mitigate SRE sensitivity to floating rate assets, an increase in business mix to institutional business at higher crediting rates and the $114 million operating gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in costs attributable to the ACRA non-controlling interests following the sale of a 50% interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increases in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60% effective December 31, 2023 and 63% effective October 1, 2024, as well as a favorable change in unlocking and a favorable impact to pension group annuity balances related to a refinement in methodology. Unlocking, net of the non-controlling interests, was favorable $16 million primarily related to favorable projected mortality lowering future benefit payments, updated economics and favorable changes in lapse and enhanced income utilization assumptions. These impacts were largely offset by an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims, an increase in the lump sum payment utilization assumption and changes to projected interest crediting. Unlocking, net of the non-controlling interests, in 2023 was unfavorable $24 million primarily related to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims. This impact was partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and income rider restart assumptions, as well as higher interest rates and favorable mortality experience lowering future benefit payments.\nInterest and other financing costs increased $29 million related to higher interest expense resulting from Athene’s debt issuances in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first and fourth quarters of 2024, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from a decrease in the average outstanding balance of short-term repurchase agreements in 2024 compared to 2023.\nNet Investment Spread\nYears ended December 31,\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n2023\n2022\nChange\nFixed income and other net investment earned rate\n4.86 \n%\n4.45 \n%\n41bps\n4.45 \n%\n3.22 \n%\n123bps\nAlternative net investment earned rate\n8.03 \n%\n7.22 \n%\n81bps\n7.22 \n%\n10.42 \n%\nNM\nNet investment earned rate\n5.03 \n%\n4.61 \n%\n42bps\n4.61 \n%\n3.66 \n%\n95bps\nStrategic capital management fees\n0.04 \n%\n0.03 \n%\n1bp\n0.03 \n%\n0.03 \n%\n0bps\nCost of funds\n(3.29)\n%\n(2.71)\n%\n58bps\n(2.71)\n%\n(1.98)\n%\n73bps\nNet investment spread\n1.78 \n%\n1.93 \n%\n(15)bps\n1.93 \n%\n1.71 \n%\n22bps\nNet investment spread was 1.78% in 2024, a decrease of 15 basis points compared to 1.93% in 2023, primarily driven by higher cost of funds, partially offset by a higher net investment earned rate.\nCost of funds was 3.29% in 2024, an increase of 58 basis points compared to 2.71% in 2023, primarily driven by higher rates on new deferred annuity issuances, higher rates on new institutional business, including the additional costs of swapping to or issuing funding agreements as floating rate to mitigate SRE sensitivity to floating rate assets, an increase in business mix to institutional business at higher crediting rates and the $114 million operating gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in costs attributable to the ACRA non-controlling interests following the sale of a 50% interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increases in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60% effective December 31, 2023 and 63% effective October 1, 2024, as well as a favorable change in unlocking and a favorable impact to pension group annuity balances related to a refinement in methodology.\nNet investment earned rate was 5.03% in 2024, an increase of 42 basis points compared to 4.61% in 2023, primarily due to higher returns in both Athene’s fixed income and alternative investment portfolios, partially offset by an increase in income attributable to the ACRA non-controlling interests following the sale of a 50% interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increases in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60% effective December 31, 2023 and 63% effective October 1, 2024\n. \nFixed income and other net investment earned rate was 4.86% in 2024, an increase from 4.45% in 2023, primarily driven by higher rates on new deployment compared to Athene’s existing portfolio related to the higher interest rate environment. \nA\nlternative net investment earned rate was 8.03% in 2024, an increase from 7.22% in 2023, primarily driven by more favorable performance within retirement services and strategic origination platforms, as well as credit, partially offset by less favorable performance within equity. The higher returns on retirement services platforms was primarily related to \n92\nTable of Contents\nunderperformance from FWD and a decrease in the share price of Challenger in 2023, partially offset by increased expenses and lower growth impacting the valuation of Athora in 2024. The higher returns from strategic origination platforms was mainly attributable to unfavorable performance from Aqua Finance in 2023 related to macroeconomic headwinds for consumer loan origination and favorable performance from Foundation Home Loans driven by increased origination volumes in 2024, partially offset by outsized performance from MidCap Financial in 2023.\nInvestment Portfolio\nAthene had total investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, of $314.6 billion and $259.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Athene’s investment strategy seeks to achieve sustainable risk-adjusted returns through the disciplined management of its investment portfolio against its long-duration liabilities, coupled with the diversification of risk. The investment strategies focus primarily on a buy and hold asset allocation strategy that may be adjusted periodically in response to changing market conditions and the nature of Athene’s liability profile. Athene takes advantage of its generally persistent liability profile by identifying investment opportunities with an emphasis on earning incremental yield by taking measured liquidity and complexity risk rather than assuming incremental credit risk. Athene has selected a diverse array of primarily high-grade fixed income assets including corporate bonds, structured securities and commercial and residential real estate loans, among others. Athene also maintains holdings in floating rate and less rate-sensitive instruments, including CLOs, non-agency RMBS and various types of structured products. In addition to its fixed income portfolio, Athene opportunistically allocates approximately 5% of its portfolio to alternative investments where it primarily focuses on fixed income-like, cash flow-based investments.\n93\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the carrying values of Athene’s total investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nCarrying Value\nPercentage of Total\nCarrying Value\nPercentage of Total\nAFS securities, at fair value\nU.S. government and agencies\n$\n7,151 \n2.3 \n%\n$\n5,399 \n2.1 \n%\nU.S. state, municipal and political subdivisions\n921 \n0.3 \n%\n1,046 \n0.4 \n%\nForeign governments\n1,568 \n0.5 \n%\n1,899 \n0.7 \n%\nCorporate\n83,585 \n26.6 \n%\n78,246 \n30.2 \n%\nCLO\n29,182 \n9.3 \n%\n20,207 \n7.8 \n%\nABS\n24,201 \n7.7 \n%\n13,383 \n5.2 \n%\nCMBS\n10,741 \n3.4 \n%\n6,591 \n2.5 \n%\nRMBS\n8,015 \n2.5 \n%\n7,567 \n2.9 \n%\nTotal AFS securities, at fair value\n165,364 \n52.6 \n%\n134,338 \n51.8 \n%\nTrading securities, at fair value\n1,583 \n0.5 \n%\n1,706 \n0.7 \n%\nEquity securities\n1,290 \n0.4 \n%\n1,293 \n0.5 \n%\nMortgage loans, at fair value\n63,239 \n20.1 \n%\n44,115 \n17.0 \n%\nInvestment funds\n107 \n— \n%\n109 \n0.1 \n%\nPolicy loans\n318 \n0.1 \n%\n334 \n0.1 \n%\nFunds withheld at interest\n18,866 \n6.0 \n%\n24,359 \n9.4 \n%\nDerivative assets\n8,154 \n2.6 \n%\n5,298 \n2.1 \n%\nShort-term investments\n447 \n0.2 \n%\n341 \n0.1 \n%\nOther investments\n2,915 \n0.9 \n%\n1,206 \n0.5 \n%\nTotal investments\n262,283 \n83.4 \n%\n213,099 \n82.3 \n%\nInvestments in related parties\nAFS securities, at fair value\nCorporate\n2,137 \n0.7 \n%\n1,352 \n0.5 \n%\nCLO\n6,035 \n1.9 \n%\n4,268 \n1.7 \n%\nABS\n10,631 \n3.4 \n%\n8,389 \n3.2 \n%\nTotal AFS securities, at fair value\n18,803 \n6.0 \n%\n14,009 \n5.4 \n%\nTrading securities, at fair value\n573 \n0.2 \n%\n838 \n0.3 \n%\nEquity securities, at fair value\n234 \n0.1 \n%\n318 \n0.1 \n%\nMortgage loans, at fair value\n1,297 \n0.4 \n%\n1,281 \n0.5 \n%\nInvestment funds\n1,853 \n0.6 \n%\n1,632 \n0.6 \n%\nFunds withheld at interest\n5,050 \n1.6 \n%\n6,474 \n2.5 \n%\nShort-term investments\n743 \n0.2 \n%\n947 \n0.4 \n%\nOther investments, at fair value\n331 \n0.1 \n%\n343 \n0.1 \n%\nTotal related party investments\n28,884 \n9.2 \n%\n25,842 \n9.9 \n%\nTotal investments, including related parties\n291,167 \n92.6 \n%\n238,941 \n92.2 \n%\nInvestments of consolidated VIEs\nTrading securities, at fair value\n2,301 \n0.7 \n%\n2,136 \n0.8 \n%\nMortgage loans, at fair value\n2,579 \n0.8 \n%\n2,173 \n0.8 \n%\nInvestment funds, at fair value\n17,660 \n5.6 \n%\n15,820 \n6.2 \n%\nOther investments\n884 \n0.3 \n%\n103 \n— \n%\nTotal investments of consolidated VIEs\n23,424 \n7.4 \n%\n20,232 \n7.8 \n%\nTotal investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs\n$\n314,591 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n259,173 \n100.0 \n%\nThe \n$55.4 billion increase\n in Athene’s total investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n \ncompared to December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by significant growth from gross organic inflows of $71.0 billion in excess of gross liability outflows of $33.5 billion, reinvestment of earnings and an increase in derivative assets primarily related to the impact of favorable equity market performance in 2024 on Athene’s call options as well as market impacts on Athene’s derivative swaps and forward contracts. Additionally, total investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, \n94\nTable of Contents\nincreased due to the issuance of debt in 2024, the consolidation of new VIEs and an increase in VIE investment funds attributable to favorable performance of the underlying assets within AAA and net contributions from third-party investors into AAA, partially offset by Athene’s distribution of certain investments to AGM as a dividend. These impacts were partially offset by unrealized losses on AFS securities in 2024 of $1.1 billion due to an increase in U.S. Treasury rates, partially offset by credit spread tightening. \nAthene’s investment portfolio consists largely of high quality fixed maturity securities, loans and short-term investments, as well as additional opportunistic holdings in investment funds and other instruments, including equity holdings. Fixed maturity securities and loans include publicly issued corporate bonds, government and other sovereign bonds, privately placed corporate bonds and loans, mortgage loans, CMBS, RMBS, CLOs and ABS. A significant majority of Athene’s AFS portfolio, 97.1% and 96.5% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, was invested in assets considered investment grade with an NAIC designation of 1 or 2.\nAthene\n invests a portion of its investment portfolio in mortgage loans, which are generally comprised of high quality commercial first lien and mezzanine real estate loans. \nAthene\n has acquired mortgage loans through acquisitions and reinsurance arrangements, as well as through an active program to invest in new mortgage loans. It invests in CMLs on income producing properties including hotels, apartments, retail and office buildings, and other commercial and industrial properties. Athene’s RML portfolio primarily consists of first lien RMLs collateralized by properties located in the U.S. \nFunds withheld at interest represent a receivable for amounts contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with modco and funds withheld reinsurance agreements in which Athene acts as the reinsurer. Generally, assets equal to statutory reserves are withheld and legally owned by the ceding company.\nWhile the substantial majority of \nAthene’s\n investment portfolio has been allocated to corporate bonds and structured credit products, a key component of Athene’s investment strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of investment funds with attractive risk and return profiles. \nAthene’s\n investment fund portfolio consists of funds or similar equity structures that employ various strategies including equity and credit funds. Athene has a strong preference for alternative investments that have some or all of the following characteristics, among others: (1) investments with credit- or debt-like characteristics (for example, a stipulated maturity and par value), or alternatively, investments with reduced volatility when compared to pure equity; or (2) investments that Athene believes have less downside risk.\nAthene \nholds derivatives for economic hedging purposes to reduce its exposure to the cash flow variability of assets and liabilities, equity market risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. Athene’s primary use of derivative instruments relates to providing the income needed to fund the annual index credits on its FIA products. Athene primarily uses fixed indexed options to economically hedge indexed annuity products that guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on a percentage of the gain in a specific market index. Athene also uses derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and swaps, to hedge foreign currency exposure resulting from foreign denominated assets and liabilities and to help manage its net floating rate position.\n95\nTable of Contents\nNet Invested Assets\nThe following summarizes \nAthene’s \nnet invested assets:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nNet Invested Asset Value\n1\nPercentage of Total\nNet Invested Asset Value\n1\nPercentage of Total\nCorporate\n$\n86,051 \n34.6 \n%\n$\n82,883 \n38.1 \n%\nCLO\n27,698 \n11.2 \n%\n20,538 \n9.4 \n%\nCredit\n113,749 \n45.8 \n%\n103,421 \n47.5 \n%\nCML\n28,055 \n11.3 \n%\n25,977 \n11.9 \n%\nRML\n27,848 \n11.2 \n%\n18,021 \n8.3 \n%\nRMBS\n7,635 \n3.1 \n%\n7,795 \n3.6 \n%\nCMBS\n8,243 \n3.3 \n%\n5,580 \n2.6 \n%\nReal estate\n71,781 \n28.9 \n%\n57,373 \n26.4 \n%\nABS\n28,670 \n11.5 \n%\n22,202 \n10.2 \n%\nAlternative investments\n12,000 \n4.8 \n%\n11,659 \n5.4 \n%\nState, municipal, political subdivisions and foreign government\n3,237 \n1.3 \n%\n3,384 \n1.5 \n%\nEquity securities\n2,201 \n0.9 \n%\n1,727 \n0.8 \n%\nShort-term investments\n1,015 \n0.4 \n%\n1,048 \n0.5 \n%\nU.S. government and agencies\n5,531 \n2.2 \n%\n4,052 \n1.9 \n%\nOther investments\n52,654 \n21.1 \n%\n44,072 \n20.3 \n%\nCash and cash equivalents\n6,794 \n2.7 \n%\n10,467 \n4.8 \n%\nOther\n3,665 \n1.5 \n%\n2,094 \n1.0 \n%\nNet invested assets\n$\n248,643 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n217,427 \n100.0 \n%\n1\n See “Managing Business Performance - Key Segment and Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures” for the definition of net invested assets.\nAthene’s \nnet invested assets were $248.6 billion and $217.4 billion as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in net invested assets was primarily driven by growth from net organic inflows of $49.1 billion in excess of net liability outflows of $27.2 billion, reinvestment of earnings, the issuance of debt in 2024 and an increase in short term repurchase agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2024, partially offset by an incremental 3% increase in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 63% effective October 1, 2024 and the distribution of certain investments to AGM as a dividend.\nIn managing its business, Athene utilizes net invested assets as presented in the above table. Net invested assets do not correspond to Athene’s total investments, including related parties, on the consolidated statements of financial condition, as discussed previously in “Managing Business Performance - Key Segment and Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures”. Net invested assets represent \nAthene’s\n investments that directly back its net reserve liabilities and surplus assets. Athene believes this view of its portfolio provides a view of the assets for which it has economic exposure. Athene adjusts the presentation for assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions to include or exclude the underlying investments based upon the contractual transfer of economic exposure to such underlying investments. Athene also adjusts for VIEs to show the net investment in the funds, which are included in the alternative investments line above as well as adjusting for the allowance for credit losses. Net invested assets include Athene’s proportionate share of ACRA investments, based on its economic ownership, but exclude the proportionate share of investments associated with the non-controlling interests.\nNet invested assets is utilized by management to evaluate \nAthene’s\n investment portfolio. Net invested assets is used in the computation of net investment earned rate, which allows Athene to analyze the profitability of its investment portfolio. Net invested assets is also used in Athene’s risk management processes for asset purchases, product design and underwriting, stress scenarios, liquidity and ALM.\n96\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Investing\nThe following table presents Principal Investing Income, the performance measure of our Principal Investing segment.\nYears ended December 31,\nTotal Change\nPercentage Change\nYears ended December 31,\nTotal Change\nPercentage Change\n(In millions, except percentages)\n2024\n2023\n2023\n2022\nPrincipal Investing:\nRealized performance fees\n$\n921 \n$\n742 \n$\n179 \n24.1%\n$\n742 \n$\n595 \n$\n147 \n24.7%\nRealized investment income (loss)\n74 \n(2)\n76 \nNM\n(2)\n330 \n(332)\nNM\nPrincipal investing compensation\n(664)\n(601)\n63 \n10.5\n(601)\n(585)\n16 \n2.7\nOther operating expenses\n(60)\n(56)\n4 \n7.1\n(56)\n(56)\n— \n—\nPrincipal Investing Income (PII)\n$\n271\n \n$\n83\n \n$\n188\n \n226.5%\n$\n83\n \n$\n284\n \n$\n(201)\n(70.8)%\nAs described in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—General”, earnings from our Principal Investing segment are inherently more volatile in nature than earnings from our Asset Management segment due to the intrinsic cyclical nature of performance fees, one of the key drivers of PII performance.\nA discussion of our Principal Investing segment analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 is included in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report.\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nIn this section, references to 2024 refer to the year ended December 31, 2024 and references to 2023 refer to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nPII was $271 million in 2024, an increase of $188 million, as compared to $83 million in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in realized performance fees and realized investment income of $179 million and $76 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in principal investing compensation expense of $63 million.\nThe increase in realized performance fees of $179 million in 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in realized performance fees generated from Fund IX, Freedom Parent Holdings and ANRP III, partially offset by a decrease in realized performance fees earned from Fund VIII.\nRealized investment income in 2024 primarily benefited from realized gains earned on the transfer of certain of Apollo’s general partner investments to Athene. Realized investment income in 2023 was negatively impacted by $42 million of losses related to the liquidations of Apollo Strategic Growth Capital II and Acropolis Infrastructure Acquisition Corp., special purpose acquisition companies sponsored by Apollo.\nPrincipal investing compensation of $664 million in 2024 increased $63 million, as compared to $601 million in 2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to an increase in profit sharing expense associated with the corresponding increase in realized performance fees, partially offset by a decrease in profit sharing expense attributable to the Company’s incentive pool, a compensation program through which certain employees are allocated discretionary compensation based on realized performance fees in a given year, and is included within principal investing compensation. In any period, the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance allocations in the period. The incentive pool is separate from the fund related profit sharing expense and may result in greater variability in compensation and have a variable impact on the blended profit sharing percentage during a particular period.\n97\nTable of Contents\nThe Historical Investment Performance of Our Funds\nBelow we present information relating to the historical performance of the funds we manage, including certain legacy Apollo funds that do not have a meaningful amount of unrealized investments, and in respect of which the general partner interest has not been contributed to us.\nWhen considering the data presented below, you should note that the historical results of funds we manage are not indicative of the future results that you should expect from such funds, from any future funds we may raise or from your investment in our common stock.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an investment in any of the Apollo managed funds, and the assets and revenues of the funds we manage are not directly available to us. The historical and potential future returns of the funds we manage are not directly linked to returns on our common stock. Therefore, you should not conclude that continued positive performance of the funds we manage will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our common stock. However, poor performance of the funds that we manage would cause a decline in our revenue from such funds, and would therefore have a negative effect on our performance and in all likelihood the value of our common stock.\nMoreover, the historical returns of funds we manage should not be considered indicative of the future results you should expect from such funds or from any future funds we may raise. There can be no assurance that any Apollo fund will continue to achieve the same results in the future.\nFinally, our private equity IRRs have historically varied greatly from fund to fund. For example, Fund VI generated a 12% gross IRR and a 9% net IRR since its inception through December 31, 2024, while Fund V generated a 61% gross IRR and a 44% net IRR since its inception through its liquidation in 2023. Accordingly, the IRR going forward for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical IRR generated by any particular fund, or for our private equity funds as a whole.

Based on management’s experience, we believe that the Company’s current liquidity position, together with the cash generated from revenues will be sufficient to meet the Company’s anticipated expenses and other working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. For the longer-term liquidity needs of the asset management business, we expect to continue to fund the asset management business’ operations through management fees and performance fees received. The principal sources of liquidity for the retirement services business, in the ordinary course of business, are operating cash flows and holdings of cash, cash equivalents and other readily marketable assets.\nAGM is a holding company whose primary source of cash flow is distributions from its subsidiaries, which are expected to be sufficient to fund cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations. AGM’s primary liquidity needs include the cash-flow requirements relating to its corporate activities, including its day-to-day operations, common stock and preferred stock dividend payments and strategic transactions, such as acquisitions.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had $15.4 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, as well as $5.1 billion of available funds from the AGM credit facility, AHL credit facility, and AHL liquidity facility. \n103\nTable of Contents\nPrimary Uses of Cash \nOver the next 12 months, we expect the Company’s primary liquidity needs will be to:\n•\nsupport the future growth of Apollo’s businesses through strategic corporate investments;\n•\npay the Company’s operating expenses, including, compensation, general, administrative, and other expenses;\n•\nmake payments to policyholders for surrenders, withdrawals and payout benefits;\n•\nmake interest and principal payments on funding agreements;\n•\nmake payments to satisfy pension group annuity obligations and policy acquisition costs;\n•\nmake interest payments on the Company’s debt;\n•\npay taxes and tax related payments; \n•\npay cash dividends;\n•\nrepurchase common stock; and\n•\nmake payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nOver the long term, we believe we will be able to (i) grow Apollo’s Assets Under Management and generate positive investment performance in the funds we manage, which we expect will allow us to grow the Company’s management fees and performance fees and (ii) grow the investment portfolio of retirement services, in each case in amounts sufficient to cover our long-term liquidity requirements, which may include:\n•\nsupporting the future growth of our businesses;\n•\ncreating new or enhancing existing products and investment platforms;\n•\nmaking payments to policyholders;\n•\npursuing new strategic corporate investment opportunities;\n•\npaying interest and principal on the Company’s financing arrangements;\n•\nrepurchasing common stock;\n•\nmaking payments under the tax receivable agreement; and\n•\npaying cash dividends.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe section below discusses in more detail the Company’s primary sources and uses of cash and the primary drivers of cash flows within the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows:\nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating Activities\n$\n3,253 \n$\n6,322 \n$\n3,789 \nInvesting Activities\n(61,801)\n(42,407)\n(23,444)\nFinancing Activities\n57,972 \n42,638 \n28,710 \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(3)\n10 \n(15)\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Cash Held at Consolidated Variable Interest Entities\n$\n(579)\n$\n6,563 \n$\n9,040 \n104\nTable of Contents\nThe assets of our consolidated funds and VIEs, on a gross basis, could have a substantial effect on the accompanying statement of cash flows.

Cash provided by financing activities of our consolidated funds and VIEs primarily includes proceeds from the issuance of debt and contributions from non-controlling interests, partially offset by repayment of debt and distributions to non-controlling interests.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects cash received from the strong organic inflows from retail, flow reinsurance and funding agreements, net of outflows, a favorable change in cash collateral posted for derivative transactions related to the favorable equity market performance in 2023, net capital contributions from non-controlling interests, issuances of the 2053 Subordinated Notes, 2033 Senior Notes and Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, and the issuance of debt by our subsidiary, partially offset by the redemption of the AAM Preferred Stock, the payment of stock dividends, the repayment of short-term repurchase obligations and distribution to redeemable non-controlling interest. Cash provided by financing activities of our consolidated funds and VIEs primarily includes proceeds from the issuance of debt, offset by payments for borrowings under repurchase agreements.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects the strong organic inflows from retail and funding agreements, net of outflows, net capital contributions from non-controlling interests, and the issuance of debt and preferred stock by our subsidiary, partially offset by the payment of stock dividends. Cash provided by financing activities of our consolidated funds and VIEs primarily includes proceeds from the issuance of debt, including repurchase agreements. \nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nFor a summary and a description of the nature of the Company’s commitments, contingencies and contractual obligations, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and “—Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies.” The Company’s commitments are primarily fulfilled through cash flows from operations and financing activities.\nConsolidated Funds and VIEs\nThe Company manages its liquidity needs by evaluating unconsolidated cash flows; however, the Company’s financial statements reflect the financial position of Apollo as well as Apollo’s consolidated funds and VIEs (including previously consolidated SPACs). The primary sources and uses of cash at Apollo’s consolidated funds and VIEs include: (a) raising capital \n106\nTable of Contents\nfrom their investors, which have been reflected historically as non-controlling interests of the consolidated subsidiaries in our financial statements, (b) using capital to make investments, (c) generating cash flows from operations through distributions, interest and the realization of investments, (d) distributing cash flow to investors, and (e) issuing debt to finance investments (CLOs).\nDividends and Distributions\nFor information regarding the quarterly dividends that were made to common stockholders and distribution equivalents on participating securities, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Although the Company currently expects to pay dividends, we may not pay dividends if, among other things, we do not have the cash necessary to pay the dividends. To the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends, we may have to borrow funds to pay dividends, or we may determine not to pay dividends. The declaration, payment and determination of the amount of our dividends are at the sole discretion of the AGM board of directors.\nBecause AGM is a holding company, the primary source of funds for AGM’s dividends is distributions from its operating subsidiaries, AAM and AHL, which are expected to be adequate to fund AGM’s dividends and other cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations. The ability of these operating subsidiaries to make distributions to AGM will depend on satisfying applicable law with respect to such distributions, including surplus and minimum solvency requirements among others, as well as making prior distributions on AHL outstanding preferred stock. Moreover, the ability of AAM and AHL to receive distributions from their own respective subsidiaries will continue to depend on applicable law with respect to such distributions. \nOn February 4, 2025, AGM declared a cash dividend of $0.4625 per share of its common stock, which will be paid on February 28, 2025 to holders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2025. \nOn February 4, 2025, the Company also declared and set aside a cash dividend of $0.8438 per share of its Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, which will be paid on April 30, 2025 to holders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2025.\nRepurchase of Securities\nShare Repurchase Program\nFor information regarding the Company’s share repurchase program, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRepurchase of Other Securities\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our other outstanding debt or equity securities through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not we repurchase any of our other securities and the size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined at our discretion.\nMandatory Convertible Preferred Stock \nOn August 11, 2023, the Company issued 28,750,000 shares, or $1.4 billion aggregate liquidation preference, of its 6.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. There were 28,749,765 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2024. See note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nAsset Management Liquidity\nOur asset management business requires limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of the business. For the asset management business’ longer-term liquidity needs, we expect to continue to fund the asset management business’ operations through management fees and performance fees received. Liquidity needs are also met (to a limited extent) through proceeds from borrowings and equity issuances as described in notes 14 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively. From time to time, if the Company determines that market conditions are favorable after taking into account our liquidity requirements, we may seek to raise proceeds through the issuance of additional debt or equity instruments. \n107\nTable of Contents\nAGM has a registration statement on Form S-3 to provide it with access to the capital markets, subject to market conditions and other factors. \nAt December 31, 2024, the asset management business had $2.7 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, as well as $1.25 billion of available funds from the AGM credit facility.\nFuture Debt Obligations\nThe asset management business had long-term debt of $4.3 billion at December 31, 2024, which includes notes with maturities in 2026, 2029, 2030, 2033, 2048, 2050, 2053 and 2054. See note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the asset management business’ debt arrangements.\nFuture Cash Flows\nOur ability to execute our business strategy, particularly our ability to increase our AUM, depends on our ability to establish new funds and to raise additional investor capital within such funds. Our liquidity will depend on a number of factors, such as our ability to project our financial performance, which is highly dependent on the funds we manage and our ability to manage our projected costs, fund performance, access to credit facilities, compliance with existing credit agreements, as well as industry and market trends. Also during economic downturns the funds we manage might experience cash flow issues or liquidate entirely. In these situations we might be asked to reduce or eliminate the management fee and performance fees we charge, which could adversely impact our cash flow in the future.\nAn increase in the fair value of the investments of the funds we manage, by contrast, could favorably impact our liquidity through higher management fees where the management fees are calculated based on the net asset value, gross assets or adjusted assets. Additionally, higher performance fees not yet realized would generally result when investments appreciate over their cost basis which would not have an impact on the asset management business’ cash flow until realized.\nConsideration of Financing Arrangements \nAs noted above, in limited circumstances, the asset management business may issue debt or equity to supplement its liquidity. The decision to enter into a particular financing arrangement is made after careful consideration of various factors, including the asset management business’ cash flows from operations, future cash needs, current sources of liquidity, demand for the asset management business’ debt or equity, and prevailing interest rates.\nRevolver Facility\nUnder the AGM credit facility, AGM and AMH, as parent borrower and subsidiary borrower, respectively, may borrow in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.25 billion and may incur incremental facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250 million plus additional amounts so long as AGM and AMH are in compliance with a net leverage ratio not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00. Borrowings under the AGM credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including without limitation, permitted acquisitions. The AGM credit facility has a final maturity date of November 21, 2029.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nThe tax receivable agreement provides for the payment to the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes that AGM and its subsidiaries realize subject to the agreement. For more information regarding the tax receivable agreement, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAthora\nAthora is a strategic liabilities platform that acquires and reinsures traditional closed life insurance policies and provides capital and reinsurance solutions to insurers in Europe. In 2017, an AAM subsidiary made a €125 million commitment to Athora, which was fully drawn as of April 2020. An AAM subsidiary committed an incremental €58 million in 2020 to purchase new equity interests. Additionally, in 2021, an AAM subsidiary acquired approximately €21.9 million of new equity interests in Athora.\n108\nTable of Contents\nIn December 2021, an AAM subsidiary committed an additional €250 million to purchase new equity interests to support Athora’s ongoing growth initiatives, of which €180 million was drawn as of December 31, 2024.\nAn AAM subsidiary and Athene are minority investors in Athora with a long-term strategic relationship. Through its share ownership, the AAM subsidiary has approximately 19.9% of the total voting power in Athora, and Athene holds shares in Athora representing 10% of the total voting power in Athora. In addition, Athora shares held by funds and other accounts managed by Apollo represent, in the aggregate, approximately 15.1% of the total voting power in Athora.\nFund Escrow\nAs of December 31, 2024, the remaining investments and escrow cash of Fund VIII was valued at 86% of the fund’s unreturned capital, which was below the required escrow ratio of 115%. As a result, the fund is required to place in escrow current and future performance fee distributions to the general partner until the specified return ratio of 115% is met (at the time of a future distribution) or upon liquidation. Realized performance fees currently distributed to the general partner are limited to potential tax distributions and interest on escrow balances per the fund’s partnership agreement.\nClawback\nPerformance fees from certain of the funds we manage are subject to contingent repayment by the general partner in the event of future losses to the extent that the cumulative performance fees distributed from inception to date exceeds the amount computed as due to the general partner at the final distribution. See “—Overview of Results of Operations—Performance Fees” for the maximum performance fees subject to potential reversal by each fund.\nIndemnification Liability\nThe asset management business recorded an indemnification liability in the event that the Former Managing Partners, Contributing Partners and certain investment professionals are required to pay amounts in connection with a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees. See note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the asset management business’ indemnification liability. \nRetirement Services Liquidity\nThere are two forms of liquidity relevant to our retirement services business: funding liquidity and balance sheet liquidity. Funding liquidity relates to the ability to fund operations. Balance sheet liquidity relates to the ability to sell assets held in Athene’s investment portfolio without incurring significant costs from fees, bid-offer spreads, or market impact. Athene manages its liquidity position by matching projected cash demands with adequate sources of cash and other liquid assets. The principal sources of liquidity for our retirement services business, in the ordinary course of business, are operating cash flows and holdings of cash, cash equivalents and other readily marketable assets.\nAthene’s investment portfolio is structured to ensure a strong liquidity position over time to permit timely payment of policy and contract benefits without requiring asset sales at inopportune times or at depressed prices. In general, liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, highly rated bonds, short-term investments, unaffiliated preferred stock and public common stock, all of which generally have liquid markets with a large number of buyers, but exclude pledged assets, mainly associated with funding agreement and repurchase agreement liabilities. Assets included in modified coinsurance and funds withheld portfolios, including assets held in reinsurance trusts, are available to fund the benefits for the associated obligations but are restricted from other uses. Although the investment portfolio of our retirement services business does contain assets that are generally considered less liquid for liquidity monitoring purposes (primarily mortgage loans, policy loans, real estate, investment funds and affiliated common stock), there is some ability to raise cash from these assets if needed.\nAthene has access to additional liquidity through its AHL credit facility and AHL liquidity facility. The AHL credit facility has a borrowing capacity of $1.25 billion, subject to being increased up to $1.75 billion in total on the terms described in the AHL credit facility. The AHL credit facility has a commitment termination date of June 30, 2028, subject to up to two one-year extensions, and was undrawn as of December 31, 2024. Athene entered into a new AHL liquidity facility on June 28, 2024, which replaced its previous agreement dated as of June 30, 2023. The AHL liquidity facility has a borrowing capacity of $2.6 billion, subject to being increased up to $3.1 billion in total on the terms described in the AHL liquidity facility. The AHL liquidity facility has a commitment termination date of June 27, 2025, subject to additional 364-day extensions, and was undrawn as of December 31, 2024. Athene also has access to $2.0 billion of committed repurchase facilities. Athene has a \n109\nTable of Contents\nregistration statement on Form S-3 to provide it with access to the capital markets, subject to market conditions and other factors. Athene is also the counterparty to repurchase agreements with several different financial institutions, pursuant to which it may obtain short-term liquidity, to the extent available. In addition, through Athene’s membership in the FHLB, it is eligible to borrow under variable rate short-term federal funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity.\nAthene proactively manages its liquidity position to meet cash needs while minimizing adverse impacts on investment returns. Athene analyzes its cash-flow liquidity over the upcoming 12 months by modeling potential demands on liquidity under a variety of scenarios, taking into account the provisions of its policies and contracts in force, its cash flow position, and the volume of cash and readily marketable securities in its portfolio.\nLiquidity risk is monitored, managed and mitigated through a number of stress tests and analyses to assess Athene’s ability to meet its cash flow requirements, as well as the ability of its reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to meet their collateral obligations, under various stress scenarios. Athene further seeks to mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining access to alternative, external sources of liquidity.\nInsurance Subsidiaries’ Operating Liquidity\nThe primary cash flow sources for Athene’s insurance subsidiaries include retirement services product inflows (premiums and deposits), investment income, principal repayments on its investments, net transfers from separate accounts and financial product inflows. Uses of cash include investment purchases, payments to policyholders for surrenders, withdrawals and payout benefits, interest and principal payments on funding agreements and outstanding debt, payments to satisfy pension group annuity obligations, policy acquisition and general operating costs and payment of cash dividends.\nAthene’s policyholder obligations are generally long-term in nature. However, policyholders may elect to withdraw some, or all, of their account value in amounts that exceed Athene’s estimates and assumptions over the life of an annuity contract. Athene includes provisions within its annuity policies, such as surrender charges and MVAs, which are intended to protect it from early withdrawals. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 82% and 79%, respectively, of Athene’s deferred annuity liabilities were subject to penalty upon surrender. In addition, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 66% and 64%, respectively, of policies contained MVAs that may also have the effect of limiting early withdrawals if interest rates increase but may encourage early withdrawals by effectively subsidizing a portion of surrender charges when interest rates decrease. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 33% of Athene’s net reserve liabilities were generally non-surrenderable, including buy-out pension group annuities other than those that can be withdrawn as lump sums, funding agreements and payout annuities, while 54% were subject to penalty upon surrender.\nMembership in Federal Home Loan Bank\nThrough its membership in the FHLB, Athene is eligible to borrow under variable rate short-term federal funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity. The borrowings must be secured by eligible collateral such as mortgage loans, eligible CMBS or RMBS, government or agency securities and guaranteed loans. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Athene had no outstanding borrowings under these arrangements.\nAthene has issued funding agreements to the FHLB. These funding agreements were issued in an investment spread strategy, consistent with other investment spread operations. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Athene had funding agreements outstanding with the FHLB in the aggregate principal amount of $15.6 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively.\nThe maximum FHLB indebtedness by a member is determined by the amount of collateral pledged and cannot exceed a specified percentage of the member’s total statutory assets dependent on the internal credit rating assigned to the member by the FHLB. As of December 31, 2024, Athene’s total maximum borrowing capacity under the FHLB facilities was limited to $49.5 billion. However, Athene’s ability to borrow under the facilities is constrained by the availability of assets that qualify as eligible collateral under the facilities and certain other limitations. Considering these limitations, as of December 31, 2024, Athene had the ability to draw up to an estimated $18.9 billion, inclusive of borrowings then outstanding. This estimate is based on Athene’s internal analysis and assumptions and may not accurately measure collateral which is ultimately acceptable to the FHLB.\n110\nTable of Contents\nSecurities Repurchase Agreements\nAthene engages in repurchase transactions whereby it sells fixed income securities to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms or commercial banks, with a concurrent agreement to repurchase such securities at a determined future date. Athene requires that, at all times during the term of the repurchase agreements, it maintains sufficient cash or other liquid assets to allow it to fund substantially all of the repurchase price. Proceeds received from the sale of securities pursuant to these arrangements are generally invested in short-term investments or maintained in cash, with the offsetting obligation to repurchase the security included within payables for collateral on derivatives and securities to repurchase on the consolidated statements of financial condition. As per the terms of the repurchase agreements, Athene monitors the market value of the securities sold and may be required to deliver additional collateral (which may be in the form of cash or additional securities) to the extent that the value of the securities sold decreases prior to the repurchase date.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the payables for repurchase agreements were $5.7 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, while the fair value of securities and collateral held by counterparties backing the repurchase agreements was $5.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, payables for repurchase agreements, based on original issuance, were comprised of $3.0 billion of short-term and $2.7 billion of long-term repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2023, payables for repurchase agreements, based on original issuance, were comprised of $686 million of short-term and $3.2 billion of long-term repurchase agreements.\nDividends from Insurance Subsidiaries\nAHL is a holding company whose primary liquidity needs include the cash-flow requirements relating to its corporate activities, including its day-to-day operations, debt servicing, preferred and common stock dividend payments and strategic transactions, such as acquisitions. The primary source of AHL’s cash flow is dividends from its subsidiaries, which are expected to be adequate to fund cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations.\nThe ability of AHL’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is limited by applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where the subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as agreements entered into with regulators. These laws and regulations require, among other things, the insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay.\nSubject to these limitations and prior notification to the appropriate regulatory agency, Athene’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay ordinary dividends based on calculations specified under insurance laws of the relevant state of domicile. Any distributions above the amount permitted by statute in any twelve-month period are considered to be extraordinary dividends, and require the approval of the appropriate regulator prior to payment. AHL does not currently plan on having the U.S. subsidiaries pay any dividends to their parents. \nDividends from AHL’s subsidiaries are projected to be the primary source of AHL’s liquidity. Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, each of Athene’s Bermuda insurance subsidiaries is prohibited from paying a dividend in an amount exceeding 25% of the prior year’s statutory capital and surplus, unless at least two members of the board of directors of the Bermuda insurance subsidiary and its principal representative in Bermuda sign and submit to the BMA an affidavit attesting that a dividend in excess of this amount would not cause the Bermuda insurance subsidiary to fail to meet its relevant margins. In certain instances, the Bermuda insurance subsidiary would also be required to provide prior notice to the BMA in advance of the payment of dividends. In the event that such an affidavit is submitted to the BMA in accordance with the Bermuda Insurance Act, and further subject to the Bermuda insurance subsidiary meeting its relevant margins, the Bermuda insurance subsidiary is permitted to distribute up to the sum of 100% of statutory surplus and an amount less than 15% of its total statutory capital. Distributions in excess of this amount require the approval of the BMA.\nThe maximum distribution permitted by law or contract is not necessarily indicative of the insurance subsidiaries’ actual ability to pay such distributions, which may be further restricted by business and other considerations, such as the impact of such distributions on surplus, which could affect Athene’s ratings or competitive position and the amount of premiums that can be written. Specifically, the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from rating agencies, including S&P, AM Best, Fitch and Moody’s, is of particular concern when determining the amount of capital available for distributions. AHL believes its insurance subsidiaries have sufficient statutory capital and surplus, combined with additional capital available to be provided by AHL, to meet their financial strength ratings objectives. Finally, state insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory surplus of Athene’s insurance subsidiaries following any dividend or distribution must be reasonable in relation to their outstanding liabilities and adequate for the insurance subsidiaries’ financial needs.\n111\nTable of Contents\nOther Sources of Funding\nAthene may seek to secure additional funding at the AHL level by means other than dividends from subsidiaries, such as by drawing on its undrawn $1.25 billion AHL credit facility, drawing on its undrawn $2.6 billion AHL liquidity facility or by pursuing future issuances of debt or preferred stock to third-party investors. The AHL credit facility contains various standard covenants with which Athene must comply, including maintaining a consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio of not greater than 35%, maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth of no less than $14.8 billion and restrictions on the ability to incur liens, with certain exceptions. Rates, ratios and terms are as defined in the AHL credit facility. The AHL liquidity facility also contains various standard covenants with which Athene must comply, including maintaining an ALRe minimum consolidated net worth of no less than $10.2 billion and restrictions on the ability to incur liens, with certain exceptions. Rates and terms are as defined in the AHL liquidity facility.\nFuture Debt Obligations\nAthene had long-term debt of $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2024, which includes notes with maturities in 2028, 2030, 2031, 2033, 2034, 2051, 2052, 2054 and 2064. See note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding Athene’s debt arrangements. \nCapital\nAthene believes it has a strong capital position and is well positioned to meet policyholder and other obligations. Athene measures capital sufficiency using various internal capital metrics which reflect management’s view on the various risks inherent to its business, the amount of capital required to support its core operating strategies and the amount of capital necessary to maintain its current ratings in a recessionary environment. The amount of capital required to support Athene’s core operating strategies is determined based upon internal modeling and analysis of economic risk, as well as inputs from rating agency capital models and consideration of both NAIC RBC and Bermuda capital requirements. Capital in excess of this required amount is considered excess equity capital, which is available to deploy. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Athene’s U.S. RBC ratio was 419% and 392%, respectively, its Bermuda RBC ratio was 450% and 400%, respectively, and its consolidated RBC ratio was 430% and 412%, respectively. The formulas for determining the amount of RBC specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. The RBC of Athene’s Bermuda insurance companies presented herein excludes the impact of any deferred taxes that may be recorded on a statutory basis as a result of the enactment of the Bermuda CIT. Athene is currently assessing deferred taxes that may be recorded on a statutory basis as a result of the Bermuda CIT, which could have a positive impact on the statutory capital and surplus of its Bermuda insurance companies.\nACRA\nACRA 1 provided Athene with access to on-demand capital to support its growth strategies and capital deployment opportunities. ACRA 1 provided a capital source to fund both Athene’s inorganic and organic channels. The commitment period for ACRA 1 expired in August 2023.\nSimilar to ACRA 1, ACRA 2 was funded in December 2022 as another long-duration, on-demand capital vehicle. Effective October 1, 2024, ACRA 2 repurchased a portion of its shares held by ALRe, which increased ADIP II’s ownership of economic interests in ACRA 2 to 63%, with ALRe owning the remaining 37%. ALRe holds all of ACRA 2’s voting interests. ACRA 2 participates in certain transactions by drawing a portion of the required capital for such transactions from third-party investors equal to ADIP II’s proportionate economic interest in ACRA 2.\nThese strategic capital solutions allow Athene the flexibility to simultaneously deploy capital across multiple accretive avenues, while maintaining a strong financial position. \n112\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of our accounting policies that are affected most by judgments, estimates and assumptions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies - Overall\nConsolidation\nWe consolidate entities on a variable interest or voting interest model or, if applicable, apply specialized accounting guidance for investment companies. Significant judgment may be required for the application of the VIE guidance and to determine whether entities qualify as investment companies under U.S. GAAP.\nThe assessment of whether an entity is a variable interest entity and the determination of whether Apollo should consolidate requires judgment. Those judgments include, but are not limited to: (i) determining whether the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (ii) evaluating whether the holders of equity investment at risk, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the success of the entity, (iii) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive the expected residual returns from an entity and (iv) evaluating the nature of the relationship and activities of those related parties with shared power or under common control for purposes of determining which party within the related-party group is most closely associated with the VIE. Judgments are also made in determining whether a member in the equity group has a controlling financial interest, including power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and rights to receive benefits or obligations to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to the VIE. This analysis considers all relevant economic interests, including proportionate interests held through related parties. \nAdditionally, evaluating an entity to determine whether it meets the characteristics of an investment company under U.S. GAAP is qualitative in nature and may involve significant judgment. The Company has retained this specialized accounting for investment companies in consolidation. \nEquity-Based Compensation\n \nEquity-based compensation is generally measured based on the grant date fair value of the award. Certain RSUs granted by the Company vest subject to continued employment and the Company’s receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods, sufficient to cover the associated equity-based compensation expense. Equity-based compensation expense for such awards, if and when granted, will be recognized on an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period to the extent the performance fee metrics are met or deemed probable. The addition of these performance measures helps to promote the interests of our shareholders and fund investors by making RSU vesting contingent on the realization and distribution of profits on our funds. For more information regarding Apollo’s equity-based compensation awards, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. The Company’s assumptions made to determine the fair value on grant date are embodied in the calculations of compensation expense.\nA significant part of our compensation expense is derived from amortization of RSUs. The fair value of all RSU grants is based on the grant date fair value, which considers the public share price of AGM. The Company has three types of RSU grants, which we refer to as Plan Grants, Bonus Grants, and Performance Grants. Plan Grants may or may not provide the right to receive dividend equivalents until the RSUs vest and the underlying shares are generally issued by March 15th after the year in which they vest. For Plan Grants, the grant date fair value is based on the public share price of the Company, and is discounted for transfer restrictions and lack of dividends until vested if applicable. Bonus Grants provide the right to receive dividend equivalents on both vested and unvested RSUs and Performance Grants provide the right to receive dividend equivalents on vested RSUs and may also provide the right to receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs. Both Bonus Grants and Performance Grants are generally issued by March 15th of the year following the year in which they vest. For Bonus Grants and Performance Grants, the grant date fair value for the periods presented is based on the public share price of AGM, and is discounted for transfer restrictions.\n113\nTable of Contents\nWe utilized the present value of a growing annuity formula to calculate a discount for the lack of pre-vesting dividends on certain Plan Grant and Performance Grant RSUs. The weighted average for the inputs utilized for the shares granted are presented in the table below for Plan Grants and Performance Grants:\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nPlan Grants:\nDividend Yield\n1\n1.5%\n2.1%\n3.0%\nCost of Equity Capital Rate\n2\n14.2%\n13.7%\n12.3%\nPerformance Grants:\nDividend Yield\n1\n1.3%\n2.2%\n2.9%\nCost of Equity Capital Rate\n2\n14.4%\n12.6%\n12.3%\n1\n Calculated based on the historical dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2024 and the price of the Company’s common stock as of the measurement date of the grant on a weighted average basis.\n2\n Assumes a discount rate that was equivalent to the opportunity cost of foregoing distributions on unvested Plan Grant and Performance Grant RSUs as of the valuation date, based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”). CAPM is a commonly used mathematical model for developing expected returns.\nWe utilize the Finnerty Model to calculate a marketability discount on the Plan Grant, Bonus Grant and Performance Grant RSUs to account for the lag between vesting and issuance. The Finnerty Model provides for a valuation discount reflecting the holding period restriction embedded in a restricted security preventing its sale over a certain period of time. \nThe Finnerty Model proposes to estimate a discount for lack of marketability such as transfer restrictions by using an option pricing theory. This model has gained recognition through its ability to address the magnitude of the discount by considering the volatility of a company’s stock price and the length of restriction. The concept underpinning the Finnerty Model is that a restricted security cannot be sold over a certain period of time. Further simplified, a restricted share of equity in a company can be viewed as having forfeited a put on the average price of the marketable equity over the restriction period (also known as an “Asian Put Option”). If we price an Asian Put Option and compare this value to that of the assumed fully marketable underlying security, we can effectively estimate the marketability discount. The inputs utilized in the Finnerty Model are (i) length of holding period, (ii) volatility and (iii) dividend yield. \n114\nTable of Contents\nThe weighted average for the inputs utilized for the shares granted are presented in the table below for Plan Grants, Bonus Grants and Performance Grants:\n \nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPlan Grants:\nHolding Period Restriction (in years)\n0.5\n4.1\n1.2\nVolatility\n1\n27.8%\n41.4%\n44.8%\nDividend Yield\n2\n1.5%\n2.1%\n3.0%\nBonus Grants:\nHolding Period Restriction (in years)\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\nVolatility\n1\n24.0%\n38.5%\n34.5%\nDividend Yield\n2\n1.5%\n2.3%\n2.9%\nPerformance Grants:\nHolding Period Restriction (in years)\n2.3\n1.1\n0.9\nVolatility\n1\n34.9%\n41.9%\n37.4%\nDividend Yield\n2\n1.3%\n2.2%\n2.9%\n1\n The Company determined the expected volatility based on the volatility of the Company’s common stock price as of the grant date with consideration to comparable companies.\n2\n Calculated based on the historical dividends paid during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and the Company’s common stock price as of the measurement date of the grant on a weighted average basis.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions when the position is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. The Company’s tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether the Company has uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period during which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies - Asset Management\nInvestments, at Fair Value \nOn a quarterly basis, Apollo utilizes valuation committees consisting of members from senior management, to review and approve the valuation results related to the investments of the funds it manages. The Company also retains external valuation firms to provide third-party valuation consulting services to Apollo, which consist of certain limited procedures that management identifies and requests them to perform. The limited procedures provided by the external valuation firms assist management with validating their valuation results or determining fair value. The Company performs various back-testing procedures to validate their valuation approaches, including comparisons between expected and observed outcomes, forecast evaluations and variance analyses. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material.\nThe fair values of the investments in the funds we manage can be impacted by changes to the assumptions used in the underlying valuation models. For further discussion on the impact of changes to valuation assumptions see “Item 7A. \n115\nTable of Contents\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Sensitivities” in this report. There have been no material changes to the valuation approaches utilized during the periods that our financial results are presented in this report.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nExcept for the Company’s debt obligations (each as defined in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements), Apollo’s financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts whose carrying values approximate fair value. See “—Investments, at Fair Value” above. While Apollo’s valuations of portfolio investments are based on assumptions that Apollo believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the actual realized gains or losses will depend on, among other factors, future operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may ultimately differ significantly from the assumptions on which the valuations were based. Financial instruments’ carrying values generally approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of those instruments or variable interest rates related to the borrowings. \nRevenue Recognition\nPerformance Fees\nApollo earns performance fees from funds we manage as a result of such funds achieving specified performance criteria. Such performance fees generally are earned based upon a fixed percentage of realized and unrealized gains of various funds after meeting any applicable hurdle rate or threshold minimum. \nPerformance allocations are performance fees that are generally structured from a legal standpoint as an allocation of capital to the Company. Performance allocations from certain of the funds that we manage are subject to contingent repayment and are generally paid to us as particular investments made by the funds are realized. If, however, upon liquidation of a fund, the aggregate amount paid to us as performance fees exceeds the amount actually due to us based upon the aggregate performance of the fund, the excess (in certain cases net of taxes) is required to be returned by us to that fund. We account for performance allocations as an equity method investment, and accordingly, we accrue performance allocations quarterly based on fair value of the underlying investments and separately assess if contingent repayment is necessary. The determination of performance allocations and contingent repayment considers both the terms of the respective partnership agreements and the current fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used. See “Investments, at Fair Value” below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments in our credit and equity funds.\nIncentive fees are performance fees structured as a contractual fee arrangement rather than a capital allocation. Incentive fees are generally received from the management of CLOs, managed accounts, ADS and MFIC. For a majority of our incentive fees, once the quarterly or annual incentive fees have been determined, there is no look-back to prior periods for a potential contingent repayment, however, certain other incentive fees can be subject to contingent repayment at the end of the life of the entity. In accordance with the revenue recognition standard, certain incentive fees are considered a form of variable consideration and therefore are deferred until fees are probable to not be significantly reversed. There is significant judgment involved in determining if the incentive fees are probable to not be significantly reversed, but generally the Company will defer the revenue until the fees are crystallized or are no longer subject to clawback or reversal. \nManagement Fees\nManagement fees related to the credit funds we manage can be based on net asset value, gross assets, adjusted cost of all unrealized portfolio investments, capital commitments, adjusted assets, capital contributions, or stockholders’ equity, all as defined in the respective partnership agreements. The management fee calculations for the credit funds we manage that consider net asset value, gross assets, adjusted cost of all unrealized portfolio investments and adjusted assets are normally based on the terms of the respective partnership agreements and the current fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used. The management fees related to equity funds we manage, by contrast, are generally based on a fixed percentage of the committed capital or invested capital. The corresponding fee calculations that consider committed capital or invested capital are both objective in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or assumptions. See “Investments, at Fair Value” below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments in the credit and equity funds.\n116\nTable of Contents\nProfit Sharing Expense\n \nProfit sharing expense is primarily a result of agreements with employees to compensate them based on the ownership interest they have in the general partners of the Apollo funds. Therefore, changes in the fair value of the underlying investments in the funds we manage and advise affect profit sharing expense. Employees are generally allocated approximately 30% to 61%, of the total performance fees which is driven primarily by changes in fair value of the underlying fund’s investments and is treated as compensation expense. Additionally, profit sharing expenses paid may be subject to clawback from employees and former employees to the extent not indemnified. When applicable, the accrual for potential clawback of previously distributed profit sharing amounts, which is a component of due from related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition, represents all amounts previously distributed to employees and former employees that would need to be returned to the general partner if the Apollo funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds’ investments as of the reporting date. The actual general partner receivable, however, would not become realized until the end of a fund’s life.\nSeveral of the Company’s employee remuneration programs are dependent upon performance fee realizations, including the incentive pool, and dedicated performance fee rights and certain RSU awards for which vesting is contingent, in part, on the realization of performance fees in a specified period. The Company established these programs to attract and retain, and provide incentive to, partners and employees of the Company and to more closely align the overall compensation of partners and employees with the overall realized performance of the Company. Dedicated performance fee rights entitle their holders to payments arising from performance fee realizations. The incentive pool enables certain employees to earn discretionary compensation based on realized performance fees in a given year, which amounts are reflected in profit sharing expense in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Amounts earned by participants as a result of their performance fee rights (whether dedicated or incentive pool) will vary year-to-year depending on the overall realized performance of the Company (and, in the case of the incentive pool, on their individual performance). There is no assurance that the Company will continue to compensate individuals through the same types of arrangements in the future and there may be periods when the Company determines that allocations of realized performance fees are not sufficient to compensate individuals, which may result in an increase in salary, bonus and benefits, the modification of existing programs or the use of new remuneration programs. Reductions in performance fee revenues could also make it harder to retain employees and cause employees to seek other employment opportunities.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies - Retirement Services\nInvestments\nThe Company is responsible for the fair value measurement of investments presented in the consolidated financial statements. The Company performs regular analysis and review of its valuation techniques, assumptions and inputs used in determining fair value to evaluate if the valuation approaches are appropriate and consistently applied, and the various assumptions are reasonable. The Company also performs quantitative and qualitative analysis and review of the information and prices received from commercial pricing services and broker-dealers, to verify it represents a reasonable estimate of the fair value of each investment. In addition, the Company uses both internally-developed and commercially-available cash flow models to analyze the reasonableness of fair values using credit spreads and other market assumptions, where appropriate. For investment funds, the Company typically recognizes its investment, including those for which it has elected the fair value option, based on net asset value information provided by the general partner or related asset manager. For a discussion of investment funds for which it has elected the fair value option, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n117\nTable of Contents\nValuation of Fixed Maturity Securities, Equity Securities and Mortgage Loans\nThe following table presents the fair value of fixed maturity securities, equity securities and mortgage loans, including those with related parties and those held by consolidated VIEs, by pricing source and fair value hierarchy:\nDecember 31, 2024\n(In millions, except percentages)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nFixed maturity securities\nAFS securities\nPriced via commercial pricing services\n$\n116,317 \n$\n7,818 \n$\n108,495 \n$\n4 \nPriced via independent broker-dealer quotations\n37,582 \n— \n34,896 \n2,686 \nPriced via models or other methods\n30,268 \n— \n278 \n29,990 \nTrading securities\nPriced via commercial pricing services\n1,130 \n21 \n1,109 \n— \nPriced via independent broker-dealer quotations\n453 \n1 \n430 \n22 \nPriced via models or other methods\n573 \n— \n— \n573 \nTrading securities of consolidated VIEs\n2,301 \n— \n347 \n1,954 \nTotal fixed maturity securities, including related parties and consolidated VIEs\n188,624 \n7,840 \n145,555 \n35,229 \nEquity securities\nPriced via commercial pricing services\n1,263 \n190 \n1,073 \n— \nPriced via independent broker-dealer quotations\n— \n— \n— \n— \nPriced via models or other methods\n261 \n— \n— \n261 \nTotal equity securities, including related parties\n1,524 \n190 \n1,073 \n261 \nMortgage loans\nPriced via commercial pricing services\n61,057 \n— \n— \n61,057 \nPriced via independent broker-dealer quotations\n— \n— \n— \n— \nPriced via models or other methods\n3,479 \n— \n— \n3,479 \nMortgage loans of consolidated VIEs\n2,579 \n— \n— \n2,579 \nTotal mortgage loans, including related parties and consolidated VIEs\n67,115 \n— \n— \n67,115 \nTotal fixed maturity securities, equity securities and mortgage loans, including related parties and consolidated VIEs\n$\n257,263 \n$\n8,030 \n$\n146,628 \n$\n102,605 \nPercentage of total\n100.0 \n%\n3.1 \n%\n56.9 \n%\n40.0 \n%\nThe Company measures the fair value of its securities based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the assets, which may include inherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset, or nonperformance risk. The estimate of fair value is the price that would be received to sell a security in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market, or the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market, for that security. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange while not under duress. The valuation of securities involves judgment, is subject to considerable variability and is revised as additional information becomes available. As such, changes in, or deviations from, the assumptions used in such valuations can significantly affect the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in security values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. The Company’s ability to sell securities, or the price ultimately realized upon the sale of securities, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain securities. Accordingly, estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.\nFor fixed maturity securities, the Company obtains the fair values, when available, based on quoted prices in active markets that are regularly and readily obtainable. Generally, these are liquid securities and the valuation does not require significant management judgment. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is based on market standard valuation techniques, giving priority to observable inputs. The Company obtains the fair value for most marketable bonds without an active market from several commercial pricing services. The pricing services incorporate a variety of market observable information in their valuation techniques, including benchmark yields, broker-dealer quotes, credit quality, issuer spreads, bids, \n118\nTable of Contents\noffers, and other reference data. For certain fixed maturity securities without an active market, an internally-developed discounted cash flow or other approach is utilized to calculate the fair value. A discount rate is used, which adjusts a market comparable base rate for securities with similar characteristics for credit spread, market illiquidity or other adjustments. The fair value of privately placed fixed maturity securities is based on the credit quality and duration of comparable marketable securities, which may be securities of another issuer with similar characteristics. In some instances, the Company uses a matrix-based pricing model, which considers the current level of risk-free interest rates, corporate spreads, credit quality of the issuer and cash flow characteristics of the security. The Company also considers additional factors, such as net worth of the borrower, value of collateral, capital structure of the borrower, presence of guarantees and its evaluation of the borrower’s ability to compete in its relevant market.\nFor equity securities, the Company obtains the fair value, when available, based on quoted market prices. Other equity securities, typically private equities or equity securities not traded on an exchange, are valued based on other sources, such as commercial pricing services or brokers.\nFor mortgage loans, the Company uses independent commercial pricing services. Discounted cash flow analysis is performed through which the loans’ contractual cash flows are modeled and an appropriate discount rate is determined to discount the cash flows to arrive at a present value. Financial factors, credit factors, collateral characteristics and current market conditions are all taken into consideration when performing the discounted cash flow analysis. \nThe Company performs vendor due diligence exercises annually for all asset classes to review vendor processes, models and assumptions. Additionally, the Company reviews price movements on a quarterly basis to ensure reasonableness.\nDerivatives\nValuation of Embedded Derivatives on Indexed Annuities\nAthene issues and reinsures products, primarily indexed annuity products, or purchases investments that contain embedded derivatives. If Athene determines the embedded derivative has economic characteristics not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for separately, unless the fair value option is elected on the host contract.\nIndexed annuities and indexed universal life insurance contracts allow the policyholder to elect a fixed interest rate return or an equity market component for which interest credited is based on the performance of certain equity market indices. The equity market option is an embedded derivative, similar to a call option. The benefit reserve is equal to the sum of the fair value of the embedded derivative and the host (or guaranteed) component of the contracts. The fair value of the embedded derivative represents the present value of cash flows attributable to the indexed strategies. The embedded derivative cash flows are based on assumptions for future policy growth, which include assumptions for expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date, future equity option costs, volatility, interest rates and policyholder behavior. The embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects Athene’s own credit rating. The host contract is established at contract inception as the initial account value less the initial fair value of the embedded derivative and accreted over the policy’s life. Contracts acquired through a business combination which contain an embedded derivative are re-bifurcated as of the acquisition date.\nIn general, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives will not directly correspond to the change in fair value of the hedging derivative assets. The derivatives are intended to hedge the index credits expected to be granted at the end of the current term. The options valued in the embedded derivatives represent the rights of the policyholder to receive index credits over the period indexed strategies are made available to the policyholder, which is typically longer than the current term of the options. From an economic basis, Athene believes it is suitable to hedge with options that align with the index terms of its indexed annuity products because policyholder accounts are credited with index performance at the end of each index term. However, because the value of an embedded derivative in an indexed annuity contract is longer-dated, there is a duration mismatch which may lead to differences in the recognition of income and expense for accounting purposes.\nA significant assumption in determining policy liabilities for indexed annuities is the vector of rates used to discount indexed strategy cash flows. The change in risk-free rates is expected to drive most of the movement in the discount rates between periods. Changes to credit spreads for a given credit rating as well as any change to Athene’s credit rating requiring a revised level of nonperformance risk would also be factors in the changes to the discount rate. If the discount rates used to discount the \n119\nTable of Contents\nindexed strategy cash flows were to fluctuate, there would be a resulting change in reserves for indexed annuities recorded through the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Athene had embedded derivative liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy of $11.2 billion. The increase (decrease) to the embedded derivatives on indexed annuity products from hypothetical changes in discount rates is summarized as follows:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\n+100 bps discount rate\n$\n(569)\n–100 bps discount rate\n626 \nHowever, these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables, such as equity price levels and market volatility, which can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values. Therefore, the quantitative impact presented in the table above does not necessarily correspond to the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statements. In determining the ranges, Athene has considered current market conditions, as well as the market level of discount rates that can reasonably be anticipated over the near-term. For additional information regarding sensitivities to interest rate risk and public equity risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n—\nSensitivities”.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nThe future policy benefit liabilities associated with long duration contracts include term and whole-life products, accident and health, disability, and deferred and immediate annuities with life contingencies, which include pension group annuities with life contingencies. Liabilities for nonparticipating long duration contracts are established as the estimated present value of benefits Athene expects to pay to or on behalf of the policyholder and related expenses less the present value of the net premiums to be collected. For immediate annuities with life contingencies, the liability for future policy benefits is equal to the present value of future benefits and related expenses.\nLiabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods which require the use of assumptions related to discount rate, expenses and policyholder behavior. Athene bases certain key assumptions related to policyholder behavior on industry standard data, adjusted to align with company experience, if needed. All cash flow assumptions, apart from expense assumptions, are established at contract issuance and reviewed annually, or more frequently, if actual experience suggests a revision is necessary.\nImmediate annuities with life contingencies, which include pension group annuities with life contingencies, and assumed whole life contracts represent the significant majority of Athene’s liabilities for future policy benefits. Significant assumptions for its immediate annuities with life contingencies include discount rates, assumptions for policyholder longevity and policyholder utilization for contracts with deferred lives, while significant assumptions for its whole life contracts include discount rates and assumptions for policyholder mortality, morbidity and lapse rates. \nIn general, the reserve for future policy benefits associated with life-contingent payout annuities will decrease when longevity decreases, resulting in remeasurement gains in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the discount rate in periods after a cohort has closed will not impact interest expense recognition within the consolidated statements of operations. However, changes in the discount rate will impact the recorded reserve on the consolidated statements of financial condition, with an offsetting unrealized gain or loss recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). Athene uses a single A rate to calculate the present value of reserves related to its immediate annuities with life contingencies and assumed whole life products.\nFor limited-payment contracts where premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, a deferred profit liability is established to the extent that gross premium exceeds the net premium reserve and included within future policy benefits. When the net premium ratio for the corresponding future policy benefit is updated for actual experience and changes to projected cash flow assumptions, both the future policy benefit reserve and deferred profit liability are retrospectively recalculated from the contract issuance date. Also included within the liability for future policy benefits is negative VOBA that was established for blocks of insurance contracts acquired through the Mergers. Negative VOBA is related to Athene’s immediate annuities with life contingencies and is subsequently measured on a basis generally consistent with the deferred profit liability.\n120\nTable of Contents\nThe increase (decrease) to future policy benefit reserves from hypothetical changes in discount rates is summarized as follows:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\n+100 bps discount rate\n$\n(3,393)\n–100 bps discount rate\n4,048 \nMarket Risk Benefits\nMarket risk benefits represent contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contract holder from, and expose the insurance entity to, other-than-nominal capital market risk. Athene issues and reinsures deferred annuity contracts, which include both traditional deferred and indexed annuities, that contain GLWB and GMDB riders. These riders meet the criteria for and are classified as market risk benefits.\nMarket risk benefits are measured at fair value at the contract level and may be recorded as a liability or an asset. At contract inception, Athene assesses the fees and assessments that are collectible from the policyholder, which include explicit rider fees and other contract fees, and allocates them to the extent they are attributable to the market risk benefit. These attributed fees are used in the valuation of the market risk benefits and are never negative or exceed total explicit fees collectible from the policyholder. Athene is also required to project the expected benefits that will be required for the riders in excess of the projected account balance. Determining the projected benefits in excess of the projected account balance requires judgment for economic and actuarial assumptions, both of which are used in determining future policyholder account growth that will drive the amount of benefits required.\nEconomic assumptions include interest rates and implied equity volatilities throughout the duration of the liability. For riders on indexed annuities, this also includes assumptions about projected equity returns, which impact expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date and future equity option costs. When economic assumptions lead to an increase in expected future policy growth from higher interest and index crediting during the accumulation period, the higher projected account balance at the time of rider utilization decreases the inherent value of the rider as less payments for benefits are required in excess of the account balance. All else constant, the increase in the projected account balance will, therefore, result in a decrease to the market risk benefit liability, or an increase if the market risk benefit is in an asset position, with remeasurement gains recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPolicyholder behavior assumptions are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods to estimate decrements to policies with riders including lapses, full and partial withdrawals (surrender rate) and mortality and the utilization of the benefit riders. Base lapse rates consider the level of surrender charges and are dynamically adjusted based on the level of current interest rates relative to the guaranteed rates and the amount by which any rider guarantees are in a net positive position. Rider utilization assumptions consider the number and timing of policyholders electing the riders. Athene tracks and updates this assumption as experience emerges. Mortality assumptions are set at the product level and are generally based on standard industry tables with adjustments for historical experience and a provision for mortality improvement. While economic assumptions impact the projected account value and the benefits paid in excess of the account value, policyholder behavior assumptions, such as surrenders, impact the expected number of policies that will elect to utilize the rider. An expected increase in decrements and decrease in rider utilization, all else constant, will result in a decrease to the market risk benefit liability or an increase in the market risk benefit asset with remeasurement gains recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAll inputs, including expected fees and assessments and economic and policyholder behavior assumptions, are used to project excess benefits and fees over a range of risk-neutral, stochastic interest rate scenarios. For riders on indexed annuities, stochastic equity return scenarios are also included within the range. The discount rate used to present value the projected cash flows is a significant assumption, with the change in risk-free rates expected to drive most of the movement in discount rates between periods. A risk margin is deducted from the discount rate to reflect the uncertainty in the projected cash flows, such as variations in policyholder behavior, and a credit spread is added to reflect Athene’s risk of nonperformance. If the discount rates used were to fluctuate, there would be a resulting change in reserves for the market risk benefits recorded through the consolidated statements of operations, except for the portion related to the change in nonperformance risk, which is recorded through other comprehensive income (loss).\n121\nTable of Contents\nThe increase (decrease) to the net market risk benefit balance from hypothetical changes in the discount rate is summarized as follows:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\n+100 bps discount rate\n$\n(867)\n–100 bps discount rate\n748 \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA list of recent accounting pronouncements that are relevant to Apollo and its industries is included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nFixed and determinable payments due in connection with the Company’s material contractual obligations are as follows as of December 31, 2024:\n(In millions)\n2025\n2026\n - \n2027\n2028\n - \n2029\n2030 and Thereafter\nTotal\nAsset Management\nOperating lease obligations\n1\n$\n82 \n$\n160 \n$\n156 \n$\n430 \n$\n828 \nOther long-term obligations\n2\n33 \n1 \n— \n— \n34 \nAGM credit facility\n3\n1 \n2 \n2 \n— \n5 \nDebt obligations\n3\n234 \n934 \n1,071 \n6,446 \n8,685 \n350 \n1,097 \n1,229 \n6,876 \n9,552 \nRetirement Services\nInterest sensitive contract liabilities\n21,781 \n59,626 \n77,107 \n95,123 \n253,637 \nFuture policy benefits\n2,944 \n5,617 \n4,932 \n36,409 \n49,902 \nMarket risk benefits\n— \n— \n— \n6,219 \n6,219 \nOther policy claims and benefits\n107 \n— \n— \n— \n107 \nDividends payable to policyholders\n8 \n15 \n13 \n56 \n92 \nDebt obligations\n3\n333 \n664 \n1,603 \n10,234 \n12,834 \nSecurities to repurchase\n4\n4,281 \n1,689 \n— \n— \n5,970 \n29,454 \n67,611 \n83,655 \n148,041 \n328,761 \nObligations\n$\n29,804 \n$\n68,708 \n$\n84,884 \n$\n154,917 \n$\n338,313 \n1\n Operating lease obligations excludes $156 million of other operating expenses associated with operating leases. \n2\n Includes (i) payments on management service agreements related to certain assets and (ii) payments with respect to certain consulting agreements entered into by the Company.

Under the terms of the Transaction, Atlas originally agreed to pay CS an amount of $3.3 billion by February 8, 2028. This deferred purchase price is an obligation first of Atlas, second of AAA, third of AAM, fourth of AHL and fifth of AARe. Each of AARe and AAM issued an assurance letter to CS for the full deferred purchase obligation amount of $3.3 billion. In March 2024, in connection with Atlas concluding its investment management agreement with CS, Atlas will no longer receive $0.8 billion of fees and the deferred purchase price obligation is reduced by a corresponding amount from $3.3 billion to $2.5 billion. In addition, certain strategic investors have made equity commitments to Atlas which therefore obligates these investors for a portion of the deferred purchase price obligation.\nIn exchange for the purchase price, Atlas originally received approximately $0.4 billion in cash and a portfolio of senior secured warehouse assets, subject to debt, with approximately $1 billion of tangible equity value. These warehouse assets are senior secured assets at industry standard loan-to-value ratios, structured to investment grade-equivalent criteria, and were approved by Atlas in connection with this Transaction. Atlas also benefits generally from the net spread earned on these assets in excess of its cost of financing. Finally, Atlas will earn total fees of $0.4 billion under the terms of the investment management agreement with CS, including management fees and transition and termination payments. As a result, the guarantee related to the Company’s aforementioned assurance letter is not probable of payment and, therefore, a liability has not been reflected on the consolidated financial statements.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nThe 2053 Subordinated Notes and the 2054 Subordinated Notes issued by AGM are guaranteed on a junior, unsecured basis, and the 2033 Senior Notes and the 2054 Senior Notes issued by AGM are both guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis, by AAM, together with certain Apollo intermediary holding companies (collectively, the “Guarantors”). The Guarantors fully and unconditionally guarantee payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest (i) on the 2053 Subordinated Notes and the 2054 Subordinated Notes on a subordinated, unsecured basis and (ii) on the 2033 Senior Notes and the 2054 Senior Notes on a senior, unsecured basis. See note 14 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these debt obligations.\nAGM, as issuer, and the Guarantors are holding companies. The primary sources of cash flow are dependent upon distributions from their respective subsidiaries to meet their future obligations under the notes and the guarantees, respectively. The 2033 Senior Notes, the 2054 Senior Notes, the 2053 Subordinated Notes and the 2054 Subordinated Notes are not guaranteed by any fee generating businesses, Apollo-managed funds, or Athene and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities will have a direct claim only against AGM as issuer.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of AGM, as the issuer of the debt securities, and the Guarantors on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances within the Guarantors and equity in the earnings from and investments in any non-guarantor subsidiary.
