These reports are available publicly on the Securities and Exchange Commission website, \nwww.sec.gov\n, and on our website, \nwww.steeldynamics.com \nunder “Investors – SEC Filings.”\nDescription of the Business\nWe are one of the largest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers in the United States, based on estimated steelmaking and steel coating capacity of approximately 16 million tons and actual metals recycling volumes, with one of the most diversified product and end market portfolios in the domestic steel industry, combined with meaningful downstream steel fabrication operations. We are currently continuing with commissioning and startup of our aluminum operations to further diversify our end markets with plans to supply aluminum flat rolled products with high recycled content to the countercyclical sustainable beverage can industry, in addition to the automotive and industrial sectors. Our primary sources of revenue are currently from the manufacture and sale of steel products, the processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals, and the fabrication and sale of steel joists and deck products.\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOperating Statement Classifications\nNet Sales\n. Net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped, product mix, and related pricing. We charge premium prices for certain grades of steel, product dimensions, certain smaller volumes, and for value-added processing or coating of our steel products. Except for the steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and claims from these sales at the point in time control of the product transfers to the customer, upon shipment or delivery. Our steel fabrication operations recognize revenues over time based on completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract.\nCosts of Goods Sold\n. Our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products. The principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes (which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold), steel substrate, direct and indirect labor and related benefits, alloys, zinc, transportation and freight, repairs and maintenance, utilities such as electricity and natural gas, and depreciation.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales, finance and accounting, and administrative departments, including, among other items, labor and related benefits, and professional services. \nCompanywide profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets are each separately presented in the statements of income.\nInterest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest\n. Interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt, net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects.\nOther (Income) Expense, net\n. Other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits, short-term and other investments, and any other non-operating income activity, including income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Other expense consists of any non-operating costs, such as certain acquisition and financing expenses.\n​\nResults Overview\nIn the third quarter of 2025 we achieved record quarterly steel shipments of 3.6 million tons. Our metals recycling operations benefitted from higher domestic steel industry demand, while our steel fabrication segment continued to experience consistently strong order activity as realized average selling prices declined slightly.\nConsolidated operating income increased $112.3 million, or 28%, to $507.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to the third quarter of 2024 as steel and metals recycling operations metal spreads expanded. Third quarter 2025 net income attributable to Steel Dynamics, Inc. increased $85.9 million, or 27%, to $403.7 million, compared to the third quarter of 2024, consistent with increased operating income.\nConsolidated operating income decreased $539.8 million, or 32%, to $1.2 billion for the first nine months of 2025, compared to the first nine months of 2024. First nine months 2025 net income attributable to Steel Dynamics, Inc. decreased $410.3 million, or 31%, to $919.6 million, compared to the first nine months of 2024, consistent with decreased operating income.\n​\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSegment Operating Results 2025 vs. 2024 (\ndollars in thousands\n)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n​\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n​\n2025\n​\n% Change\n​\n​\n2024\n​\n2025\n​\n% Change\n​\n2024\nNet sales:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n   Steel Operations Segment\n$\n 3,650,856\n​\n21% \n​\n$\n 3,024,008\n​\n$\n 10,189,415\n​\n4% \n​\n$\n 9,786,498\n   Metals Recycling Operations Segment\n​\n 1,134,127\n​\n10% \n​\n​\n 1,029,677\n​\n​\n 3,368,787\n​\n6% \n​\n​\n 3,181,046\n   Steel Fabrication Operations Segment\n​\n 378,259\n​\n(16)%\n​\n​\n 449,803\n​\n​\n 1,071,394\n​\n(22)%\n​\n​\n 1,375,302\n   Aluminum Operations Segment\n​\n 104,444\n​\n26% \n​\n​\n 83,209\n​\n​\n 298,658\n​\n26% \n​\n​\n 237,169\n   Other\n​\n 320,763\n​\n(22)%\n​\n​\n 411,733\n​\n​\n 1,030,600\n​\n(11)%\n​\n​\n 1,163,985\n​\n​\n 5,588,449\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 4,998,430\n​\n​\n 15,958,854\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 15,744,000\n   Intra-company\n​\n (760,234)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n (656,815)\n​\n​\n (2,196,321)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n (2,075,748)\n​\n$\n 4,828,215\n​\n11% \n​\n$\n 4,341,615\n​\n$\n 13,762,533\n​\n1% \n​\n$\n 13,668,252\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOperating income (loss):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n   Steel Operations Segment\n$\n 496,792\n​\n65% \n​\n$\n 301,254\n​\n$\n 1,106,748\n​\n(22)%\n​\n$\n 1,410,805\n   Metals Recycling Operations Segment\n​\n 31,533\n​\n414% \n​\n​\n 6,134\n​\n​\n 78,533\n​\n88% \n​\n​\n 41,725\n   Steel Fabrication Operations Segment\n​\n 107,020\n​\n(35)%\n​\n​\n 165,592\n​\n​\n 316,880\n​\n(40)%\n​\n​\n 524,672\n   Aluminum Operations Segment\n​\n (56,510)\n​\n(157)%\n​\n​\n (22,018)\n​\n​\n (125,872)\n​\n(190)%\n​\n​\n (43,435)\n   Other\n​\n (72,051)\n​\n(20)%\n​\n​\n (60,154)\n​\n​\n (204,143)\n​\n12% \n​\n​\n (231,961)\n​\n​\n 506,784\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 390,808\n​\n​\n 1,172,146\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 1,701,806\n   Intra-company\n​\n 973\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 4,629\n​\n​\n (6,390)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 3,729\n​\n$\n 507,757\n​\n28% \n​\n$\n 395,437\n​\n$\n 1,165,756\n​\n(32)%\n​\n$\n 1,705,535\n​\nSteel Operations Segment\nSteel operations include our EAF steel mills, including Butler Flat Roll Division, Columbus Flat Roll Division, Southwest-Sinton Flat Roll Division, Structural and Rail Division, Engineered Bar Products Division, Roanoke Bar Division, and Steel of West Virginia; steel coating and processing operations at The Techs, Heartland Flat Roll Division, United Steel Supply, and Vulcan Threaded Products, Inc.; warehouse operations in Mexico; and a 75% controlling equity interest in SDI Biocarbon Solutions, LLC. Steel operations accounted for 73% and 67% of our consolidated net sales during the three-month periods ending September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively, and 72% and 69% during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nSteel Operations Segment Shipments (tons):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n​\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n​\n2025\n​\n% Change\n​\n2024\n​\n2025\n​\n% Change\n​\n2024\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTotal shipments\n 3,613,330\n​\n14% \n​\n 3,181,377\n​\n 10,444,667\n​\n8% \n​\n 9,640,171\n    Intra-segment shipments\n (348,469)\n​\n​\n​\n (320,674)\n​\n (1,038,297)\n​\n​\n​\n (1,001,795)\nSteel Operations Segment shipments\n 3,264,861\n​\n14% \n​\n 2,860,703\n​\n 9,406,370\n​\n9% \n​\n 8,638,376\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nExternal shipments\n 3,162,805\n​\n15% \n​\n 2,754,853\n​\n 9,123,456\n​\n10% \n​\n 8,311,539\n​\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSteel Operations Segment Results 2025 vs. 2024\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, our steel operations achieved record shipments of 3.6 million tons (3.3 million excluding intra-segment) as imports declined from the elevated levels seen earlier in the year. We continue to observe some hesitancy from customers due to trade uncertainties, despite several encouraging demand drivers—such as manufacturing onshoring, infrastructure program funding, lower interest rates, and the increasing regionalization of supply chains in the US. Third quarter 2025 total steel segment average selling prices increased 6%, or $61 per ton, compared to the third quarter of 2024, while segment shipments increased 14%. Net sales for the steel operations in the third quarter of 2025 increased 21% compared to the same period in 2024, due to the increased segment shipments, coupled with increased average selling prices. Net sales for the steel operations increased 4% in the first nine months of 2025 when compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to increased segment shipments offsetting decreased average selling prices, particularly in the first quarter of 2025.\nMetallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost, generally comprising approximately 55% to 65% of our steel mill operations’ manufacturing costs. Our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel mills increased $14 per ton, or 4%, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, consistent with overall increased domestic ferrous scrap pricing noted below in the Metals Recycling Operations segment discussion. In the first nine months of 2025, our metallic raw material cost per ton was flat compared to the same period in 2024.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, as a result of average selling prices rising more than scrap costs, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average steel mill selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed in our steel mills) increased 7% compared to the third quarter of 2024. As a result of this metal spread expansion, operating income for the steel operations increased 65%, to $496.8 million, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. First nine months 2025 operating income decreased 22%, to $1.1 billion, compared to the first nine months of 2024 due primarily to a 7% decrease in metal spread, as average selling prices decreased more than scrap costs despite higher shipment volume.\n​\n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMetals Recycling Operations Segment\nMetals recycling operations include our OmniSource ferrous and nonferrous processing, transportation, marketing, brokerage, and scrap management services throughout the United States and in Central and Northern Mexico. Our steel mills utilize a large portion of the ferrous scrap sold by our metals recycling operations as raw material in our steelmaking operations, and the remainder is sold to other consumers, such as other steel manufacturers and foundries. In the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, 66% and 63%, respectively, of metals recycling operations ferrous scrap was sold to our own steel mills, while our steel mill utilization was 88% and 80% in the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Metals recycling operations accounted for 11% and 12% of our consolidated net sales during the three-month periods ending September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively, and 12% and 11% during the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively.\nMetals Recycling Operations Segment Shipments:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n​\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n​\n2025\n​\n% Change\n​\n2024\n​\n2025\n​\n% Change\n​\n2024\nFerrous metal (gross tons)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n   Total \n 1,590,153\n​\n9% \n​\n 1,461,810\n​\n 4,639,168\n​\n5% \n​\n 4,429,523\n   Inter-company\n (1,052,133)\n​\n​\n​\n (924,728)\n​\n (2,998,508)\n​\n​\n​\n (2,764,348)\n      External shipments\n 538,020\n​\n0% \n​\n 537,082\n​\n 1,640,660\n​\n(1)%\n​\n 1,665,175\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNonferrous metals (thousands of pounds)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n   Total \n 242,842\n​\n1% \n​\n 241,292\n​\n 721,499\n​\n(2)%\n​\n 739,057\n   Inter-company\n (53,799)\n​\n​\n​\n (44,556)\n​\n (142,780)\n​\n​\n​\n (137,720)\n      External shipments\n 189,043\n​\n(4)%\n​\n 196,736\n​\n 578,719\n​\n(4)%\n​\n 601,337\n​\nMetals Recycling Operations Segment Results 2025 vs. 2024\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, our metals recycling operations benefitted from increased domestic steel mill utilization, resulting in near record quarterly ferrous shipments. Ferrous scrap shipments increased 9% compared to the same period in 2024 while nonferrous shipments increased 1%. Ferrous scrap average selling prices increased 6% during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, while nonferrous scrap prices increased 3%, resulting in an overall 10% increase in segment net sales. Ferrous metal spreads (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap) increased 3% during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, and nonferrous metal spreads increased 74%, particularly due to copper. As a result of the increased metals spreads, particularly within nonferrous, metals recycling operations operating income increased 414% to $31.5 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024.\nNet sales for our metals recycling operations in the first nine months of 2025 increased 6% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by increased ferrous volumes and increased selling prices for both ferrous and nonferrous metals. Ferrous scrap average selling prices increased 2% during the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, while nonferrous average selling prices increased 7%. Ferrous shipments increased 5% and nonferrous shipments decreased 2% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the first nine months of 2024. Ferrous metal spreads were flat, while nonferrous metal spreads increased 32% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the first nine months of 2024. As a result of the combination of these volume and metal spread changes, metals recycling operations operating income in the first nine months of 2025 of $78.5 million increased 88% from the first nine months of 2024.\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNet sales for our metals recycling operations in the first nine months of 2025 increased 6% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by increased ferrous volumes and increased selling prices for both ferrous and nonferrous metals.

As a result of the combination of these volume and metal spread changes, metals recycling operations operating income in the first nine months of 2025 of $78.5 million increased 88% from the first nine months of 2024.\nSteel Fabrication Operations Segment\nSteel fabrication operations include our New Millennium Building Systems’ joist and deck plants located throughout the United States, and in Northern Mexico. Revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of girders, steel joists and steel deck used within the non-residential construction industry. Steel fabrication operations accounted for 8% of our consolidated net sales during the three-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2025, and 10% during the three-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024.\nSteel Fabrication Operations Segment Results 2025 vs. 2024\nNet sales for the steel fabrication operations decreased 16% during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, as average selling prices decreased $341 per ton, or 12%, and volume decreased 4% from the third quarter of 2024. While demand remained historically strong, the third quarter of 2025 sales volumes were down compared to the third quarter of 2024, with continued declining selling prices, as industry average selling prices continue to move toward pre-pandemic levels. Our steel fabrication operations continue to benefit from the solid non-residential construction market, continued onshoring of manufacturing, and the U.S. infrastructure program, as evidenced by an order backlog that extends through the first quarter of 2026. Net sales for the segment decreased 22% during the first nine months of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, as volume decreased 8%, and average selling prices decreased 15%.\nThe purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations, historically representing approximately two-thirds of the total cost of manufacturing. The average cost per ton of steel consumed decreased 4% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel) contracted 17% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Metal spread compression coupled with decreased volume resulted in operating income decreasing 35% to $107.0 million in the third quarter 2025, compared to $165.6 million in the same period in 2024. For the first nine months of 2025, operating income decreased 40% to $316.9 million compared to the first nine months of 2024, as a result of an 18% decrease in metal spread, coupled with decreased volumes.\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAluminum Operations Segment\nAluminum operations include our recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill nearing completion of construction in Columbus, Mississippi, two satellite recycled aluminum slab centers in the southwest United States and Central Mexico, and an ancillary recycled aluminum deox-rod facility, formerly included in the results of our metals recycling operations segment. We successfully produced and sold our first aluminum coils late in the second quarter of 2025, and we expect volume to steadily increase as we continue to commission and ramp operations. The results of this segment largely consist of construction, start-up, and commissioning costs recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses, which continued to increase in the third quarter of 2025, consistent with increased headcount and start-up costs\n. \n​\nOther Consolidated Results\nThird Quarter Consolidated Results 2025 vs. 2024\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses.\n Selling, general and administrative expenses of $200.8 million during the third quarter of 2025 increased 20% from $167.7 million during the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense and the ongoing commissioning related to the growth of the aluminum operations segment during 2025. Selling, general and administrative expenses represented 4.2% and 3.9% of net sales during the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nProfit sharing expense during the third quarter of 2025 of $42.4 million increased 23% from $34.4 million during the same period in 2024, consistent with increased pretax earnings. This increase in profit sharing expense was the primary driver of increased operating loss for our other operations of 20% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Profit sharing expense for eligible employees is 8% of consolidated pretax income excluding noncontrolling interests and other items.\nInterest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest. \nDuring the third quarter of 2025, net interest expense of $13.6 million decreased 20% from $17.1 million during the third quarter of 2024. This decrease is primarily a result of higher capitalized interest during the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 due to ongoing construction and expansion projects, primarily within our aluminum operations.\nOther (Income) Expense, net. \n Net other income was $19.7 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $29.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $10.0 million due primarily to decreased interest income due to lower invested cash balances during 2025.\nIncome Tax Expense. \nThird quarter 2025 income tax expense of $109.9 million, at an effective income tax rate of 21.4%, increased 26% compared to $87.1 million, also at an effective income tax rate of 21.4%, during the third quarter of 2024, consistent with increased pretax earnings.\nFirst Nine Months Consolidated Results 2025 vs. 2024 \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses.\n Selling, general and administrative expenses of $580.7 million during the first nine months of 2025 increased 19% from $487.2 million during the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense related to the execution of our growth strategy during 2025. Selling, general and administrative expenses represented 4.2% and 3.6% of net sales during the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nProfit sharing expense during the first nine months of 2025 of $95.8 million decreased 34% from $145.1 million during the same period in 2024, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. This decrease in profit sharing expense was the primary driver of decreased operating loss for our other operations of 12% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.\nInterest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest.\n  During the first nine months of 2025, interest expense of $43.1 million increased 3% from $41.8 million during the first nine months of 2024. This increase is primarily a result of \n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\nhigher outstanding long-term debt balances during the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 due to our issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2025.\nOther (Income) Expense, net. \n Net other income was $59.7 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared to $75.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, a decrease of $15.5 million due primarily to the impact of decreased interest income due to lower invested cash balances in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.\nIncome Tax Expense. \nFirst nine months 2025 income tax expense of $259.6 million, at an effective income tax rate of 22.0%, decreased 35% compared to $398.8 million, at an effective income tax rate of 22.9%, during the first nine months of 2024, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. In July 2025, U.S. Congress enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”), which included significant provisions modifying the U.S. tax framework. These legislative changes did not and are not expected to have a material impact on our third quarter and future effective tax rates, tax liabilities, and cash taxes. As required by ASC 740, \nIncome Taxes,\n the estimated impact of the OBBBA has been included in our financial results in the third quarter of 2025, the period of enactment. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources and Long-term Debt. \nOur business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations, and to remain in compliance with environmental laws. Our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, including expansion projects, principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, dividends to our shareholders, potential stock repurchases and acquisitions or investments. We have met and intend to continue to meet these liquidity requirements primarily with available cash and cash provided by operations, long-term borrowings, and we also have availability under our unsecured Revolver. Our liquidity at September 30, 2025, is as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCash and equivalents\n​\n$\n 770,356\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOther investments\n​\n​\n 245,569\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nRevolver availability\n​\n​\n 1,190,640\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTotal liquidity\n​\n$\n 2,206,565\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOur total outstanding debt of $3.8 billion increased $551.4 million compared to December 31, 2024, due to our issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2025 as described in Note 3, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment at maturity of our $400.0 million 2.400% notes due June 2025, and may include working capital, capital expenditures, advances for or investments in our subsidiaries, acquisitions, redemption and repayment of other outstanding indebtedness, and purchases of our common stock. Our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current maturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total stockholders’ equity) was 29.7% and 26.5% at September 30, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nOur unsecured credit agreement has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Facility), which provides a $1.2 billion Revolver and matures in July 2028. Subject to certain conditions, we have the ability to increase the Facility size by $500.0 million. The unsecured Revolver is available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. The Facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability to incur indebtedness and permit liens on certain assets. Our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the unsecured Revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants\n. At September 30, 2025, we had $1.2 billion of availability on the Revolver, $9.4 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings outstanding.\nThe financial covenants under our Facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50:1.00. Our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve-months (LTM) consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Facility (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash \n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\ntransactions as defined in the Facility) by our LTM gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. In addition, a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.60:1.00 must be maintained. At September 30, 2025, our interest coverage ratio and debt to capitalization ratio were 13.50:1.00 and 0.30:1.00, respectively. We were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2025, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months.\nWorking Capital (representing excess of current assets over current liabilities). \nWe generated cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2025 compared to $1.5 billion in the same 2024 period. Working capital increased $841.9 million, or 26%, during the first nine months of 2025 to $4.1 billion at September 30, 2025, due primarily to the issuance of our $600.0 million 5.250% notes due in May 2035 and $400.0 million 5.750% notes due in May 2055, offset by the repayment of our $400.0 million of 2.400% senior notes in June 2025, as well as a $344.8 million dollar increase in accounts receivable consistent with increased steel prices and sales volumes in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024.\nCapital Investments. \nDuring the first nine months of 2025, we invested $759.5 million in property, plant and equipment, primarily within our aluminum operations and steel operations segments, compared with $1.4 billion invested during the same period in 2024. \nWe are nearing completion of construction of our recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill with two new supporting satellite recycled aluminum slab centers, which are being funded by available cash and cash flow from operations. Related expenditures began in the third quarter of 2022 and have continued through 2025.\n Our liquidity of $2.2 billion and anticipated future operating cash flow generation is sufficient to provide for our planned 2025 capital requirements.\nCash Dividends. \nAs a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation capability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 9% to $0.50 per share in the first quarter of 2025 (from $0.46 per share for each quarter in 2024), resulting in declared cash dividends of $221.7 million during the first nine months of 2025, compared to $214.6 million during the same period in 2024. We paid cash dividends of $218.1 million and $212.2 million during the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our board of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. The determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans.\nOther. \nOur board of directors has authorized share repurchase programs during prior years and the current year, the most recent of which occurred in February 2025 for a program of up to $1.5 billion of the company’s common stock. Under the share repurchase programs, purchases take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects, our cash flows from operations, and general economic conditions. The share repurchase programs do not require us to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended, extended, or terminated by us at any time. The share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date. There were $660.6 million and $917.0 million of share repurchases during the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2025, we had $1.0 billion remaining available to purchase under the February 2025 share repurchase program. \nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial, and business conditions, along with competition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. We believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including borrowings under our Facility, if necessary, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and funding anticipated capital expenditures.\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents"
