MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-looking statements\nCertain information and statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, statements \ncontaining the words “forecast,” “guidance,” “goals,” “projects,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” \n“seeks,” “should,” “targets,” or “will,” or the negative of those words or similar words, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the \nmeaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as \namended. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that \nmay affect our future plans of operations, business strategy, results of operations, and financial position. A number of important factors \ncould cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by the forward-looking statements, including, \nbut not limited to, the following:\n•\nOperating factors, such as a failure to operate our business successfully in comparison to market expectations or in \ncomparison to our competitors, our inability to obtain capital when desired or refinance debt maturities when desired, and/\nor a failure to maintain our status as a REIT for federal tax purposes;\n•\nMarket and industry factors, such as adverse developments concerning the life science industry and/or our tenants;\n•\nGovernment factors, such as any unfavorable effects resulting from federal, state, local, and/or foreign government \npolicies, laws, and/or funding levels;\n•\nGlobal factors, such as negative economic, social, political, financial, credit market, banking conditions, and/or regional \narmed hostilities; and\n•\nOther factors, such as climate change, cyber intrusions, and/or changes in laws, regulations, and financial accounting \nstandards.\nGlobal trade policies\nWe have been monitoring and will continue to monitor macroeconomic trends and uncertainties. In particular, we are \nassessing how recent fluctuations in international trade relations and trade policies could adversely affect our business or the \nbusinesses of our tenants. \nIn early March 2025, the U.S. government imposed or indicated that it would impose a series of tariffs on certain goods from \nCanada and Mexico as well as raise tariffs on Chinese imports. President Trump has also indicated his intent to impose a “major” \npharmaceutical-specific tariff, which could adversely affect our business and/or the business of our tenants. As a result of these \ndevelopments, the global securities and trade markets have reacted with volatility, and trade tensions remain high.\nThe imposition of tariffs or the potential future imposition of additional or modified tariffs in the current geopolitical climate could \nhave material adverse effects on the net profitability, revenues, or operations of Alexandria and many other companies. While we are \nevaluating the potential impacts of such tariffs, as well as our ability to mitigate such impacts, these recent trends may in the meantime \ninterrupt supply chains, fragment international business relationships, and create unknown risks that would thereby affect our or our \ntenants’ business operations.\nThis list of risks and uncertainties is not exhaustive. Additional information regarding risk factors that may affect us is included \nunder Part I; “Item 1A. Risk factors”; and “Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of \noperations” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and under respective sections in this quarterly \nreport on Form 10-Q. Readers of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should also read our other documents filed publicly with the SEC \nfor further discussion regarding such factors.\n51\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax \npurposes. \nAlexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE: ARE),\n an\n \nS&P 500\n®\n company, is a best-in-class, mission-driven life science \nREIT making a positive and lasting impact on the world. With our founding in 1994, Alexandria pioneered the life science real estate \nniche. \nAlexandria is the preeminent and longest-tenured owner, operator, and developer of collaborative Megacampus™ ecosystems in \nAAA life science innovation cluster locations, including Greater Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, \nResearch Triangle, and New York City.\n As of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, Alexandria has a total market capitalization of\n \n$27.8 billion\n and an \nasset base in North America that includes\n \n39.1 million\n RSF\n of operating properties\n and\n \n4.2 million\n RSF\n of Class A/A+ properties \nundergoing construction and \no\nne\n \n100%\n pre-leased\n committed near-term project expected to commence construction in the next year\n.\n \nWe develop dynamic Megacampus ecosystems that enable and inspire some of the world’s most brilliant minds and innovative \ncompanies to create life-changing scientific and technological innovations. We believe in the utmost professionalism, humility, and \nteamwork. Our tenants include multinational pharmaceutical companies; life science product, service, and device companies; public \nand private biotechnology companies; advanced technologies companies; biomedical institutions; U.S. government institutions; and \nothers. Alexandria has a long-standing and proven track record of developing Class A/A+ properties clustered in highly dynamic and \ncollaborative Megacampus environments that enhance our tenants’ ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and \ninspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. Alexandria also provides strategic capital to transformative life science \ncompanies through our venture capital platform. \nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n:\n•\nInvestment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represented \n53%\n o\nf our annual rental revenue;\n•\nApproximately \n97%\n \nof our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) contained effective annual rent escalations \napproximating\n \n3%\n that were either fixed\n \nor indexed based on a consumer price index or other index; \n•\nApproximately \n91%\n \nof our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay \nsubstantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other \noperating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent; \n•\nApproximately \n92%\n of our leases (on an \nannual rental revenue\n basis) \nprovided for the recapture of capital expenditures \n(such as HVAC maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement, and parking lot resurfacing) that we believe would \ntypically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases; and\n•\n82%\n of our leasing activity during the last twelve months was generated from our existing tenant base.\nA key element of our business strategy is our unique focus on Class A/A+ properties primarily located in collaborative \nMegacampus ecosystems in AAA life science innovation clusters. Our Megacampus ecosystems are designed for optionality and \nscalability, offering our tenants a clear path to address their growth requirements, including through our future developments and \nredevelopments. Strategically located near top academic and medical research institutions and equipped with curated amenities and \nservices, and convenient access to transit, our Megacampus ecosystems are designed to support our tenants in attracting and retaining \ntop talent and in meeting our tenants’ growth needs, which we believe is a key driver of tenant demand for our properties. Our strategy \nalso includes drawing upon our deep, broad, and long-standing real estate and life science industry relationships in order to retain \ntenants, identify and attract new and leading tenants, and source additional real estate.\n52\nExecutive summary\nOperating results\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet (loss) income attributable to Alexandria’s \ncommon stockholders – diluted:\nIn millions\n$\n(234.9)\n$\n164.7\n$\n(356.1)\n$\n374.5\nPer share\n$\n(1.38)\n$\n0.96\n$\n(2.09)\n$\n2.18\nFunds from operations attributable to Alexandria’s \ncommon stockholders – diluted, as adjusted:\nIn millions\n$\n377.8\n$\n407.9\n$\n1,166.3\n$\n1,217.3\nPer share\n$\n2.22\n$\n2.37\n$\n6.85\n$\n7.08\nFor additional information, refer to “Funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to Alexandria \nReal Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders” under “\nDefinitions and reconciliations\n” and to the tabular presentation of these items \nin “\nResults of operations\n” in Item 2.\nA sector-leading REIT with a high-quality, diverse tenant base, strong margins, and long lease terms\n(As of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, unless stated otherwise)\nOccupancy of operating properties in North America\n90.6%\nPercentage of total annual rental revenue in effect from Megacampus platform\n77%\nPercentage of total annual rental revenue in effect from investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants\n53%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin for the \nthree months ended September 30, 2025\n71%\nPercentage of leases containing annual rent escalations\n97%\nWeighted-average remaining lease term:\nTop 20 tenants\n9.4\nyears\nAll tenants\n7.5\nyears\nStrong tenant collections for the three months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025\n:\nTenant rents and receivables for the three months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025\n collected as of the date of this \nreport\n99.9%\nStrong and flexible balance sheet with significant liquidity;\n \ntop 15%\n \ncredit rating\n ranking among all publicly traded U.S. REITs \nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, unless stated otherwise:\n•\nNet debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA of \n6.1x\n \nand\n \nfixed-charge coverage ratio of \n3.9x\n for the \nthree months \nended September 30, 2025\n annualized,\n with targets for the three months ended December 31, 2025 annualized of\n \n5.5x\n to \n6.0x\n and \n3.6x\n to \n4.1x\n, respectively.\n•\nSignificant liquidity of\n \n$4.2 billion\n, or\n \n4.2x\n our debt maturities through 2027\n.\n•\nOnly \n7%\n of our total debt matures through 202\n7\n.\n•\n11.6\n years weighted-average remaining term of deb\nt,\n \nlongest\n among S&P 500 REITs\n.\n•\nSince \n2021\n, our \nquarter-end fixed-rate debt has averaged \n96.7%\n.\n•\nT\notal debt and preferred stock to gross assets of \n31%\n.\n•\n$166.9 million\n of capital contribution commitments from existing consolidated real estate joint venture partners to fund \nconstruction from \nOctober 1, 2025\n through \n2027\n and beyond\n.\n53\nSolid leasing volume and rental rate increases\n•\nLeasing volume of \n1,171,344\n RSF during the \nthree months ended September 30, 2025\n.\n \n•\nIncludes the largest life science lease in company history with a long-standing multinational pharmaceutical tenant for \na \n16-year build-to-suit lease expansion aggregating \n466,598\n RSF\n on the Campus Point by Alexandria Megacampus \nin our University Town Center submarket.\n•\nLeasing of p\nreviously vacant space aggregating \n256,633\n RSF, up \n40%\n, over the quarterly average over the last five \nquarters.\n•\nRental rate increases on lease renewals and re-leasing of space of\n \n15.2%\n and \n6.1%\n (cash basis)\n for the \nthree months \nended September 30, 2025\n and \n13.6%\n and \n6.8%\n (cash basis) for the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n.\n•\n82%\n \nof our leasing activity during the last twelve months \nwas generated from our existing tenant base.\nSeptember 30, 2025\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nLease renewals and re-leasing of space:\nRental rate increase\n15.2%\n13.6%\nRental rate increase (cash basis)\n6.1%\n6.8%\nRSF \n354,367\n1,722,184\nLeasing of previously vacant space – RSF\n256,633\n550,986\nLeasing of development and redevelopment space – RSF\n560,344\n698,542\nTotal leasing activity – RSF\n1,171,344\n2,971,712\nKey operating metrics\n•\nT\notal revenues \n•\n$751.9 million\n, \ndown\n \n5.0%\n,\n for the \nthree months ended September 30, 2025\n, compared to \n$791.6 million\n f\nor the \nthree \nmonths ended September 30, 2024\n.

Although we seek to minimize the risks posed by these trends and uncertainties as discussed in the mitigating factors section \nbelow, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in preventing material impacts on our future results of \noperations, financial position, and cash flows. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk factors” within “Part II – Other information” of this quarterly report \non Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk factors” within Part I in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, \n2024\n for \ndiscussion of additional risks we face.\n•\nNew competitive supply may exert pressure on our rental rates and occupancy, and adversely affect our operating \nresults.\n \n•\nDuring and after the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift toward hybrid and remote work arrangements has led certain office and \nother real estate companies to repurpose their underutilized office spaces into laboratory facilities. Our success and the \nsuccess of other laboratory operators have prompted and may continue to prompt new and existing life science developers to \ncommence speculative redevelopment and/or development projects in anticipation of demand for laboratory facilities. These \nconversion and speculative development projects have contributed to a significant influx of new laboratory properties in key \nmarkets such as Boston, San Diego, and the San Francisco Bay Area, heightening competitive pressures and diluting \nlandlords’ pricing power in certain submarkets. \n•\nTo remain competitive with the influx of new laboratory properties, we may be required to reduce our rental rates and/or offer \nmore tenant improvement allowances or additional tenant concessions, including free rent, to retain existing tenants, or attract \nnew tenants. Furthermore, our existing operating properties may require additional revenue- and non-revenue-enhancing \ncapital investments earlier than typically expected. The table below reflects a trend of increasing revenue- and non-revenue-\nenhancing capital expenditures, which include tenant improvement expenditures. The table also presents the trend, on a per \nRSF basis, for our tenant improvements and leasing commissions, free rent concessions, decreasing growth in rental rates \nrelated to our renewed/re-leased spaces, and decreases in our operating occupancy (dollars in thousands, except per RSF \namounts):\nRevenue- and \nNon-Revenue- \nEnhancing \nCapital \nExpenditures\nTenant \nImprovements/\nLeasing \nCommissions \nper RSF \nFree Rent \nConcessions per \nAnnum \n(leases executed in \ntrailing 12 months)\nRental Rate \nIncreases \n(on renewed/\nre-leased \nspaces)\nOperating \nOccupancy \n(as of each \nperiod end) \nFiscal year 2023\n$\n260,392\n$\n26.09\n0.6 months\n29.4%\n94.6%\nFiscal year 2024\n$\n273,377\n$\n46.89\n0.7 months\n16.9%\n94.6%\nNine months ended September 30, 2025\n$\n230,867\n$\n66.29\n1.2 months\n13.6%\n90.6%\nMidpoint of \n2025\n guidance range\n$\n415,000\nN/A\n11.0%\n90.8%\n(1)\n(1)\nOur guidance assumes an approximate 1% benefit related to a range of assets with vacancy that could potentially qualify for held for sale designation during \nthe fourth quarter of 2025.

However, given the elevated supply of new laboratory space \nin these markets, there can be no assurance that we will be able to re-lease some or all of this space on acceptable terms or \nwithin anticipated time frames, even at reduced rates.\nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, we anticipate that \n4.2 million\n RSF\n \nof our projects undergoing construction and \none\n \n100%\n pre-\nleased\n committed near-term project expected to commence construction in the \nnext year\n will be \nplaced into service from \n2025\n \nthrough\n \n2028\n and will generate \n$390 million\n in future incremental annual net operating income\n. These projects are\n \n43%\n \nleased \nor under lease negotiations\n as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n.\n Additionally, landlord-funded tenant improvement allowances have \nincreased significantly for first-generation space, including development and redevelopment projects, with most space in shell \ncondition requiring landlords to fund the full build-out cost. This trend places additional pressure on projected returns and \noverall economics. Realization of the aforementioned risks could hinder our ability to secure tenants for the remaining \nunleased RSF related to these projects at the expected rates, or at all, potentially leading to a shortfall in, or delays in the \ncommencement of, the projected incremental annual net operating income.\n57\n•\nUnfavorable macroeconomic environment, capital markets, and life science industry fundamentals may negatively \nimpact the value of our real estate and non-real estate portfolios which could result in significant impairments, and \nmay limit our ability to raise capital efficiently to further our business objectives.\n \nThe effective execution of our development and redevelopment activities is contingent on access to capital required to fund \nprojects. The midpoint of our range for \n2025\n construction spend is \n$1.75 billion\n. \nThis includes significant remaining \nconstruction costs to complete our active pipeline, and anticipated increases in both revenue- and non-revenue-enhancing \ncapital expenditures in our operating portfolio. We expect funding for construction spending in 2026 to be similar or slightly \nhigher than the\n \n$1.75 billion\n midpoint of \nour guidance range for 2025 construction in order to complete our active construction \nprojects and significant revenue- and non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures necessary to lease vacant space. \nAdditionally, given the factors previously described which could negatively impact EBITDA, we would require significant equity-\ntype capital to manage our leverage profile. \n•\nLower property valuations and increased capitalization rates\n. A portion of our projected construction spending and \nacquisition and other opportunistic uses of capital spending is expected to be funded through dispositions and sales of \npartial interests in core and non-core real estate assets. Real estate investments are generally less liquid than many other \ninvestment types, which can present challenges in selling our properties timely or at desirable prices, especially in an \nenvironment of oversupply. \nReal estate sales can be particularly challenging given the demand for real estate is impacted by an economic climate \nmarked by ongoing uncertainties around tenant demand for space and elevated interest rates, in addition to those related \nto oversupply. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target range from \n5.25%\n–\n5.50%\n at the end of \n2023 to \n4.25%\n–\n4.50%\n during 2024, and to \n4.00%\n–\n4.25%\n in September 2025, interest rates remain elevated. This could \ncontinue to limit access to debt and/or equity financing for prospective buyers of our real estate assets, potentially \neliminating their participation in the market or forcing them to seek more expensive alternative funding options. All other \naspects being equal, such challenges for buyers lead to an excess of properties available for sale, which exert downward \npressure on property valuations and elevate capitalization rates, adversely impacting the sales proceeds we expect from \nour real estate asset sales.\nThe new supply, discussed above, combined with high interest rates and reduced market liquidity, has resulted in a \nprolonged period of lower property valuations and higher capitalization rates, potentially leading to significant additional \nreal estate impairments and making it more challenging to execute asset sales within expected timelines and at favorable \npricing. For additional information about our dispositions, refer to “\nSales of real estate assets and impairment of real \nestate\n” in Note 3 – “Investments in real estate” to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in “Item 1. Financial \nstatements” (“Item 1”) for additional information. In \n2025\n, we expect to complete dispositions and sales of partial interests \nof approximately \n$1.50 billion\n at the midpoint of our \n2025\n guidance range. However, we may not be able to achieve this \nand/or other targets disclosed in our 2025 guidance as a result of the uncertainties discussed in this section as well as in \n“Item 1A. Risk factors” within “Part II – Other information” of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and “Item 1A. Risk factors” \nwithin Part I in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, \n2024\n.\nThe table below presents total dispositions and a trend of increasing impairments of real estate and capitalization rates \nassociated with dispositions and sales of partial interests in our real estate assets (dollars in thousands), which is partly \nattributable to the quality of core and non-core assets we sold during each period. There is no assurance that this upward \ntrend will stabilize or reverse in the future. \nTotal Dispositions and \nSales of Partial \nInterests\nImpairment of\nReal Estate\nCapitalization \nRates\n(1)\nCapitalization \nRates \n(Cash Basis)\n(1)\n2023\n$\n1,314,414\n$\n461,114\n6.7%\n5.9%\n2024\n$\n1,382,453\n$\n223,068\n7.7%\n6.5%\nNine months ended September 30, 2025\n$\n342,441\n$\n485,630\nN/A\n(2)\nMidpoint of \n2025\n guidance range\n$\n1,500,000\n$\n828,500\nN/A\n(1)\nCapitalization rates are calculated only for stabilized operating assets sold. Refer to “Capitalization rates” under “\nDefinitions and reconciliations\n”\n for\n \nadditional information.\n(2)\nThere were no significant stabilized laboratory dispositions completed during the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n.\nThe midpoint of our 2025 guidance range for dispositions of real estate assets is\n \n$1.5 billion\n. As of September 30, 2025, \nwe have completed dispositions aggregating\n \n$340.9 million\n, and expect to complete an additional\n \n$1.2 billion\n of \ndispositions during the fourth quarter of 202\n5 to achieve the midpoint of our 2025 guidance range. We continue to \nevaluate a significant number of disposition targets, including non-core operating properties, both stabilized and \nunstabilized, and land parcels.\n58\nUnder U.S. GAAP, existing real estate assets are evaluated for impairment upon indication of potential impairment. \nImpairments of real estate assets held and used are recognized if future undiscounted cash flows, including estimated \nproceeds from eventual sale of an asset, are less than the carrying amount of the asset. For real estate assets held for \nsale, impairments are recognized if the expected sales price less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount. For \nadditional information on accounting for real estate impairments, refer to “Impairment of long-lived assets” in Note 2 – \n“Summary of significant accounting policies” to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we have evaluated a large number of potential disposition targets under a probability-weighted \nmethod, including under the held and used and held for sale models. In each case, no impairment charge was required. If \nthese specific assets meet the criteria to be designated as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2025, we may incur \nimpairments ranging from\n \n$0\n to \n$685 million\n.\nOur revised 2025 guidance range for impairments of real estate is from\n \n$485.6 million\n to\n \n$1.17 billion\n (\nwith a midpoint at \n$828.5 million\n) consisting of\n \n$485.6 million\n \nrecognized in our consolidated statements of operations during the \nnine \nmonths ended September 30, 2025\n and additional potential impairments \nranging from \n$0\n to \n$685 million\n \nduring the fourth \nquarter of 2025. If these impairments are recognized during the fourth quarter of 2025, they will have a material impact on \nour net income and earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2025. However, these impairments will not \nimpact our funds from operations (“FFO”) per share as Nareit requires the add-back of real estate impairment charges. \nFFO and FFO per share, as adjusted represent non-GAAP measures. For their definitions and reconciliations from the \nmost directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, refer to “Funds from operations and \nfunds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders” under \n“Definitions and reconciliations” in Item 2. \nWe expect a significant source of funding from the sale of non-core assets in 2026. We anticipate an end to our large-\nscale non-core asset sales program in 2026 or early 2027. As of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n,\n \n77%\n of our annual rental revenue\n is \nfrom our Megacampus™ platform and we expect this percentage to continue to grow over time. \n•\nIncreased cost and limited availability of capital.\n \nIn\n February \n2025\n, we issued \n$550.0 million\n of unsecured senior notes\n \npayable\n, primarily to refinance our\n \n$600.0 million\n \nunsecured senior notes payable that matured in April 2025\n. Currently, we\n \ndo not expect to issue any additional new debt in 2025. \nHowever, should we encounter difficulties in selling our real estate\n \nassets at our targeted prices, we may need to increase our reliance on debt financing to fund our construction projects,\n \nwhich are projected to aggregate approximately \n$1.75 billion\n i\nn construction spending based on the midpoint of our \n2025\n \nguidance range. Elevated benchmark interest rates may result in debt funding options that are costlier, less accessible, or\n \neven unavailable, potentially limiting our ability to complete our development and redevelopment projects on schedule and\n \nthereby delaying our expected incremental annual net operating income generation and negatively affecting our business.\nThe table below reflects interest rates related to our unsecured senior notes payable issued in \n2023\n, \n2024\n, and in \nFebruary \n2025\n (dollars in thousands). There is no assurance that high debt costs will not continue into the future.\nUnsecured Senior \nNotes Payable Issued\nInterest Rate\n(1)\n2023\n$\n1,000,000\n5.07%\n2024\n$\n1,000,000\n5.57%\nFebruary 2025 issuance and midpoint of our \n2025\n guidance\n$\n550,000\n5.66%\n(1)\nIncludes amortization of loan fees, amortization of debt premiums (discounts), and other bank fees.\n•\nCapitali\nzed Interest.\n \nIn \n2025\n, our capitalized interest and interest expense are expected to be \n$335 million\n and \n$210 million\n, respectively, each at the midpoints of our \n2025\n guidance ranges\n. Our strategic focus is on prioritizing the \ncompletion of our projects under construction that are highly leased. Additionally, we invest in our future pipeline with the \ngoals of enhancing value and reducing the timeline to allow for vertical construction. This is in response to our expectation \nof increased future demand for these projects and is reflected in our expectation for capitalized interest. Refer to \n“\nCapitalized interest\n” under “\nDefinitions and reconciliations\n” in Item 2 for additional information.\nThe challenging macroeconomic environment, including the elevated supply of laboratory space, high costs or \nunavailability of debt, and challenges in obtaining sufficient proceeds from real estate dispositions, as discussed above, \nhave, however, necessitated and may continue to necessitate a reevaluation of our current plans, and lead to a temporary \nsuspension of our construction projects, delay of future projects, or sale of non-income-producing property. This could \nresult in a decline in our capitalized interest for \n2025\n and beyond below our current projections and a further increase in \ninterest expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations.\n59\nThe table below presents gross interest expense, capitalized interest, and interest expense in \n2023\n and \n2024\n and \nprojections for 2025 based on the midpoint of our \n2025\n guidance ranges (in thousands):\nGross Interest Expense\nCapitalized Interest\nInterest Expense\n2023\n$\n438,182\n$\n(363,978)\n$\n74,204\n2024\n$\n516,799\n$\n(330,961)\n$\n185,838\nMidpoint of \n2025\n guidance range\n$\n545,000\n$\n(335,000)\n$\n210,000\nIn addition to capitalized interest, we incur capitalized projects costs, including property taxes, insurance, and other costs \ndirectly related and essential to the construction of Class A/A+ properties. If we cease activities necessary to prepare a \nproject for its intended use, costs related to such project are expensed as incurred. \nDuring the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n, our average real estate basis capitalized aggregated\n \n$8.2 billion\n. This \nincludes: \n•\n$2.8 billion\n \nrelated to development and redevelopment projects under construction and \none\n \n100%\n pre-leased \ncommitted near-term project expected to commence construction in the next year\n;\n•\n$1.1 billion\n \nrelated to smaller redevelopments and repositioning capital projects; and\n•\n$4.2 billion\n related to future pipeline projects expected to reach key milestones in the fourth quarter of 2025 and 2026, \nincluding various phases of entitlement, design, site work, and other activities necessary to begin aboveground \nvertical construction, on\n \nApril 14, 2026\n, on a weighted-average real estate investment basis\n.\n \nAt that time, we may \nevaluate whether to proceed with additional pre-construction and/or construction activities based on leasing demand \nand/or market conditions, pause future investments, or consider the potential dispositions of real estate assets.\n•\nVolatility in non-real estate investments\n.\n We hold strategic investments in publicly traded companies and privately held \nentities primarily involved in the life science industry. These investments are subject to market and sector-specific risks \nthat can substantially affect their valuation. Like many other industries, the life science industry is susceptible to \nmacroeconomic challenges, such as ongoing economic uncertainty and a tighter capital environment. These factors may \nlead to increased volatility in the valuation of our non-real estate investments. \nIn such a challenging environment, distributions from our investments — which we may receive as dividends, as \nliquidation distributions from our investments in limited partnerships, or as a result of mergers and acquisitions that lead to \nour privately held investees being acquired by other entities — may be limited and could result in lower realized gains. \nMoreover, we may face challenges in selling these securities at optimal prices, potentially disrupting our capital strategy. \nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to realize these gains or sustain our historical level of annual realized \ngains in the future, and in periods with limited or no realized gains, our FFO per share, as adjusted, may be adversely \naffected.  \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recognized\n \n$94.7 million\n, o\nr an average of approximately\n \n$32 million\n \nper quarter, in realized gains on non-real estate investments. The midpoint of our revised guidance range for realized \ngains on non-real estate investments assumes approximately\n \n$15 million\n in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nThe table below presents \nrealized\n gains, impairments, and unrealized losses\n on our non-real estate investments (in \nthousands):\nNon-Real Estate Investments\nRealized Gains\n(1)\nImpairments \nUnrealized Losses\n2023\n$\n80,628\n$\n74,550\n$\n201,475\n2024\n$\n117,214\n$\n58,090\n$\n112,246\nNine months ended September 30, 2025\n$\n94,650\n$\n75,535\n$\n71,568\nMidpoint of \n2025\n guidance range\n$\n110,000\nN/A\n(1)\nExcludes impairment charges.\nGross u\nnrealized g\nains\n related to non-real estate investments held as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, \nDecember 31, 2024\n, and \nDecember 31, 2023\n aggregated to \n$180.4 million\n, \n$228.1 million\n, and \n$320.4 million\n, respectively. \nUnfavorable market conditions could also indicate potential impairment of our investments in privately held entities that do \nnot report NAV per share and lead to the recognition of additional significant non-real estate impairments. \n60\n•\nGovernment policy and regulatory disruption\n. Recent and ongoing policy actions by the U.S. government have introduced \nsignificant volatility and uncertainty into the life science ecosystem, with direct implications for our tenants, non-real estate \ninvestments, and overall business. Material developments include workforce reductions at the National Institutes of Health \nand U.S. Food and Drug Administration, reimbursement cuts at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and \nfunding freezes affecting research at certain U.S. research institutions. These changes have led to the suspension of \nmany research projects, delays in regulatory reviews and approvals of drugs and other medical products, and increased \nbarriers to clinical and regulatory progress, including for early-stage life science companies. Moreover, foreign markets, \nespecially China, are rapidly gaining ground as global biotechnology leaders due to their centralized funding and faster \nregulatory timelines. The U.S. life science industry risks losing its competitive advantage as companies increasingly look \nabroad to conduct research. Combined with new immigration restrictions that affect international research talent, these \npolicy actions threaten the long-term viability of the U.S. biomedical industry. The cumulative effect of these developments \nmay significantly reduce tenant demand for U.S. life science real estate. At the same time, trade tensions and widespread \ntariffs may increase the cost of capital and key materials, which could delay or reduce our development pipeline. Refer to \n“Item 1A. Risk factors” within “Part II – Other information” of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for more information.\nThe realization of any of the aforementioned risks could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and operating \nperformance, including but not limited to our income from rentals, net operating income, results of operations, funds from operations, \noperating margins, initial stabilized yields (unlevered) on new or existing construction projects, occupancy, EPS, FFO per share, FFO \nper share, as adjusted, and net cash provided by operating activities. These impacts could decrease Adjusted EBITDA, adversely \nimpacting our key metrics such as our Adjusted EBITDA margin and Net Debt and Preferred Stock to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, as well \nas our credit ratings and credit rating outlooks. To preserve liquidity and mitigate an increase to our Net Debt and Preferred Stock to \nAdjusted EBITDA ratio that may be caused by potential declines in Adjusted EBITDA, we may seek additional capital through equity \nofferings, pursue additional sales of real and non-real estate assets, which could be dilutive to existing stockholders. A reduction in \nearnings and/or net cash provided by operating activities could potentially necessitate or make advisable a reduction in our dividends \nper share, as determined by our board of directors. Any of the foregoing could further negatively affect our business and the market \nvalue of our common stock.   \n•\nMitigating factors:\n•\nMegacampus strategy: focusing on premier Class A/A+ assets in AAA life science innovation cluster locations.\n \nAlexandria has established a high-quality Labspace\n®\n asset base predominantly concentrated in markets with high barriers \nto entry. Despite a recent increase in the availability of laboratory space, we expect to continue to benefit from our focus \non Class A/A+ assets strategically clustered in Megacampus ecosystems in AAA life science innovation cluster locations \nin close proximity to top academic and medical research institutions. This proximity is a key driver of tenant demand. \nThese campuses are used in two distinct ways: (i) to house the research operations of our tenants and (ii) to recruit and \nretain the best talent available from a limited pool, which underscores why their scale, strategic design, and location are \ncritical. \nChief executive officers of life science companies typically anticipate rapid growth upon their companies’ achievement of \nscientific milestones. Our Megacampus ecosystems, which offer both high visibility and a clear path for growth, are \ndesigned for scalability to accommodate our tenants’ growth. \nOur future developments and redevelopments aggregate\n \n26.4 million\n RSF\n \nas of September 30, 2025\n, of which\n \n76%\n is \nconcentrated within our Megacampus ecosystems\n. Their \nstrategic locations and path for growth serve as powerful incentives for tenants to lease space from us. \nMoreover, our tenants recognize that their success is directly linked to their ability to attract and retain personnel to \nadvance their science. With our Megacampus ecosystems, we aim to provide a superior set of amenities, services, and \naccess to transit. With inspiring design and people-centric amenities, we believe these campuses enhance our tenants’ \nconfidence in using these spaces as effective recruiting tools. In contrast, we believe that a significant amount of the \ncompetitive supply in the market today consists of isolated facilities that provide operational space but lack the scale and \nstrategic design of our Megacampus ecosystems.  \nConsequently, we believe an external growth strategy that focuses on the development of new Megacampus ecosystems, \nand the enhancement of existing ones, serves as our most effective defense against competitive supply. Over the past \nthree decades, we have established a significant market presence in AAA innovation cluster locations, which is \nchallenging to replicate due to the significant time and capital requirement. We believe the focus on our Megacampus \nstrategy will continue to position us favorably over the supply of new competitive laboratory spaces. The strength of this \nstrategy is reflected in the \n2025\n performance metrics below, achieved despite a challenging macroeconomic environment:\n61\n•\nLeasing volume aggregating \n3.0 million\n RSF for the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n. \nIn July 2025, we executed the largest life science lease in company history with a long-standing multinational \npharmaceutical tenant for a \n1\n6-year build-to-suit lease expansion\n aggregating\n \n466,598\n RSF\n on the \nCampus \nPoint by Alexandria Megacampus in our University Town Center submarket\n.\n•\nWeighted-average lease term\n of \n12.6\n years \nfor leases executed during the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n.\n•\nProjects expected to stabilize in \n2025\n and \n2026\n are\n \n80%\n leased/negotiating\n. \n•\nRental rate increases of \n13.6%\n and \n6.8%\n (cash basis) for the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n.\n•\nOccupancy of \n90.6%\n \nas of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n.\n•\nStrength of our brand.\n \nAs a recognized leader in the life science and real estate sectors, Alexandria has successfully \nbuilt a diverse and high-quality tenant base. Over the past three decades, we have fostered long-standing relationships \nand strategic partnerships with our tenants, which have enabled us to maintain strong occupancy, leasing, and growth in \nnet operating income and cash flows and to effectively navigate through various economic cycles. Key indicators of our \nbrand strength include the following:\n•\nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, \n82%\n of our leasing activity during the last twelve months was generated from our existing \ntenant base.\n•\nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, \n90%\n of our top 20 tenant annual rental revenue is derived from investment-grade or \npublicly traded large cap companies.\n•\nOur tenant collections have remained consistently high, averaging \n99.8%\n since the beginning of 2021 through \nSeptember 30, 2025\n.\n•\nPrudent financial management.\n Our strong and flexible balance sheet and prudent balance sheet management are key \nfactors in our ability to navigate macroeconomic uncertainties and capitalize on new opportunities. The strength of our \nfinancial position is highlighted by several key indicators:\n•\nOur significant liquidity o\nf \n$4.2 billion\n \nas of September 30, 2025\n provides us the flexibility to address our operational \nneeds and to pursue strategic opportunities.\n•\nWe expect to have the ability to self-fund a large portion of our capital requirements through the following sources in \n2025\n:\n•\n$475 million\n in net cash provided by operating activities after dividends at the midpoint of our \n2025\n guidance \nrange\n.\n•\n$166.9 million\n in capital contributions to fund construction expected from our existing consolidated real estate \njoint venture partners from \nOctober 1, 2025\n through December 31, \n2027\n and beyond\n.\n•\n$1.50 billion\n from dispositions and sales of partial interests in real estate assets at the midpoint of our \n2025\n \nguidance range.\n \n•\nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, \nour credit ratings from \nS&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Ratings were\n \nBBB+\n and \nBaa1\n, \nrespectively, which rank in the\n \ntop 15%\n \namong all publicly traded U.S. REITs\n.\n•\nOur net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA ratio\n target is \n5.5x to 6.0x\n for the fourth quarter of 2025 \nannualized.\n•\nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, \nou\nr fixed-rate debt represents \n88.6%\n of our total debt,\n which provides predictability in debt \nservicing costs. \nSince \n2021\n, our quarter-end fixed-rate debt has averaged\n \n96.7%\n.\n•\nOur debt maturity schedule is well laddered, which provides us with financial flexibility and reduces short-term \nrefinancing risks\n. \nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, only \n7%\n of our debt matures through 2027\n.\n•\nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, \nthe weighted-average remaining term of our debt is \n11.6\n years\n,\n \nlongest\n among S&P 500 \nREITs, \ndemonstrating our strategic approach to debt management and our focus on maintaining manageable annual \ndebt maturities.\n•\nOperational excellence of our team.\n Alexandria focuses on operational excellence in the direct asset management and \noperations of our Labspace\n®\n asset base. Our team is composed of highly experienced, educated, and professionally \ncredentialed facilities specialists. This expertise is essential in ensuring a secure and efficient environment for \ngroundbreaking scientific research and has been cultivated and maintained over many years. \nThe demanding nature of laboratory-based scientific research requires strict adherence to safety standards set by local, \nstate, and federal regulatory bodies. Key compliance aspects include good manufacturing practices (GMP) and Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certifications, adherence to national biosafety level guidelines, proper \npermitting and handling of hazardous waste generation and chemical storage, maintenance of safety stations, effective \nmanagement of ultra-low temperature freezers, and careful licensing and management of radioactive materials. \n62\n•\nLife science fundamentals.\n We monitor market demand trends, particularly in the life science industry, to optimally align \nour property offerings with tenant requirements. The life science industry has shown strong long-term growth, fueled by \nmultifaceted sources of funding, including private venture capital, biopharmaceutical spend, government funding, and \nphilanthropic support for biomedical innovation. We believe our focus on high-quality Labspace\n®\n assets in prime locations \npositions us to effectively capitalize on these long-term trends:\n•\nThe R&D expenditures by U.S. publicly traded life science companies nearly doubled in 2023 compared to 2014. As \nof \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n17\n of the top 20 pharma R&D spenders (for the year 2023) are Alexandria tenants.\n•\nThe sector’s growth is further supported by substantial funding of life science companies by private-venture capital, \nwhich aggregated over $40 billion in 2024, or over 2.5x the capital deployed in 2014. \n•\nOther mitigating factors\n•\nImprovement in office market.\n The increase in demand for premium office space since 2024, primarily driven by the \ntechnology sector, particularly companies focused on artificial intelligence, absorbed some of the market’s supply \npreviously anticipated for life science use, which is now being repositioned back into offices. High ceilings, improved \nventilation systems, and abundant natural light have become highly desirable features, appealing to office and \nadvanced technologies tenants. We expect this trend may lead to the exit from the life science sector of \ninexperienced life science real estate developers and expedite the resolution of the oversupply impacting the sector.\n•\nProjected decrease in general and administrative expenses.\n Over the past several years, we have implemented \ncomprehensive measures to reduce our expenditures across our organization, including our general and \nadministrative expenses, which provided savings during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year \nended December 31, 2023. These initiatives are expected to generate a reduction in general and administrative \nexpenses of approximately\n \n$49 million\n, or \n29%\n,\n during the year ending December 31, \n2025\n (at the midpoint of our \n2025 guidance range) compared to the year ended December 31, \n2024\n. These savings are expected to stem from a \nvariety of implemented cost-control and efficiency initiatives, including, but not limited to, the following:\n(i)\nPersonnel-related matters, including:\n•\nReduction in headcount over the last two years.\n•\nRestructuring of various compensation plans.\n(ii)\nStreamlining of business processes:\n•\nImplementation of systems upgrades, process improvements, and smarter technology.\n•\nRenegotiation of contracts related to legal, technology, and operational support services, and \nelimination of redundancies through better alignment and consolidation of roles. \nWe anticipate that approximately half of the cost reductions expected to be achieved in 2025 will continue in 2026. \n63\nOperating summary\nSame Property Performance:\n  Net Operating Income Changes\nRental Rate Growth: \nRenewed/Re-Leased Space\nMargins\n(2)\nFavorable Lease Structure\n(3)\nOperating\nAdjusted EBITDA\nStrategic Lease Structure by Owner and \nOperator of Collaborative Megacampus Ecosystems\n68%\n71%\nIncreasing cash flows\nPercentage of leases containing annual \nrent escalations\n97\n%\nStable cash flows\nLong-Duration Lease Terms\n(4)\nPercentage of triple net leases\n91\n%\n9.4 Years\n7.5 Years\nLower capex burden\nPercentage of leases providing for the \nrecapture of capital expenditures \n92\n%\nTop 20 Tenants\nAll Tenants\nNet Debt and Preferred Stock \nto Adjusted EBITDA\n(5)\nFixed-Charge Coverage Ratio\n(5)\n(3.1)%\n2024\nYTD \n9/30/25\n(1)\n5.5x to 6.0x\n3.6x\n to \n4.1x\nRefer to “\nSame properties\n” and “\nDefinitions and reconciliations\n” in Item 2 for additional details. “\nDefinitions and reconciliations\n” contains the definitions of “Fixed-charge \ncoverage ratio,” “Net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA,” and “Net operating income” and their respective reconciliations from the most directly comparable \nfinancial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\n(1)\nRefer to footnote 1 in “Same properties” in Item 2 for additional details.  \n(2)\nFor the \nthree months ended September 30, 2025\n.\n(3)\nPercentages calculated based on our annual rental revenue in effect\n \nas of September 30, 2025\n.\n(4)\nRepresents the weighted-average remaining term based on annual rental revenue in effect \nas of September 30, 2025\n.\n(5)\nQuarter annualized. \n64\nStable Cash Flows From Our High-Quality and Diverse Mix of \nApproximately \n700\n Tenants\nInvestment-Grade or Publicly Traded \nLarge Cap Tenants\n90%\nof ARE’s Top 20 Tenant \nAnnual Rental Revenue\n53%\nof ARE’s Total Annual \nRental Revenue\nLife Science \nProduct, \nService, and \nDevice\nMultinational \nPharmaceutical\nPublic \nBiotechnology \n– Approved or \nMarketed \nProduct\nOther\n(1)\nAdvanced \nTechnologies\n(2)\n \nPublic \nBiotechnology – \nPreclinical or \nClinical Stage\nGovernment \nInstitutions\nBiomedical\nInstitutions\n(3)\n \nPrivate \nBiotechnology\nPercentage of ARE’s \nAnnual Rental Revenue\nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n.

The weighted-average \nexpected delivery date is approximately \nMay 1, 2026\n, and the expected annual rental revenue is approximately \n$46 million\n. \n70\nInvestments in real estate\nA key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of \nnew\n \nClass A/A+ properties, and property enhancements identified during the underwriting of certain acquired properties, primarily located in \ncollaborative Megacampus ecosystems in AAA life science innovation clusters. These projects are focused on providing high-quality, \ngeneric, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of a wide range of tenants. Upon completion, each development or \nredevelopment project is expected to generate increases in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development and \nredevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe may result in higher \noccupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value. Our pre-construction \nactivities are undertaken in order to prepare the property for its intended use and include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and \nother activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements.\nOur investments in real estate consisted of the following as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n (dollars in thousands):\nDevelopment and Redevelopment\nUnder Construction\n100%\n \nPre-leased \nCommitted \nNear Term\n(1)\nOperating\n2025 and \n2026\n2027 and \nBeyond\nFuture\nSubtotal\nTotal\nSquare footage\nOperating\n37,303,013\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n37,303,013\nFuture Class A/A+ development and \nredevelopment properties\n—\n969,524\n2,803,640\n466,598\n24,257,782\n28,497,544\n28,497,544\nFuture development and redevelopment square \nfeet currently included in rental properties\n(2)\n—\n—\n—\n(52,620)\n(2,082,454)\n(2,135,074)\n(2,135,074)\nTotal square footage, excluding properties held for \nsale\n37,303,013\n969,524\n2,803,640\n413,978\n22,175,328\n26,362,470\n63,665,483\nProperties held for sale\n1,811,787\n—\n—\n—\n939,756\n939,756\n2,751,543\nTotal square footage\n39,114,800\n969,524\n2,803,640\n413,978\n23,115,084\n27,302,226\n66,417,026\nInvestments in real estate\nGross book value as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n(3)\n$\n29,451,717\n$\n901,674\n$\n2,762,729\n$\n60,398\n$\n4,984,144\n$\n8,708,945\n(4)\n$\n38,160,662\nProperties held for sale\n883,455\n—\n—\n—\n112,681\n112,681\n996,136\nTotal gross investment in real estate, excluding \nproperties held for sale\n$\n28,568,262\n$\n901,674\n$\n2,762,729\n$\n60,398\n$\n4,871,463\n$\n8,596,264\n$\n37,164,526\n20%\nNon-Income- \nProducing Assets\nProjects under active construction with \nstabilization in 2025-2027 and beyond \nand one 100% pre-leased committed \nnear-term project expected to commence \nin the next year–\n \n$3.7 billion\nFuture development projects\n(5)\n and land parcels, \nprimarily located in Megacampuses with critical \nmilestones in 4Q25 and 2026 –\n \n$4.9 billion\nNon-Income-Producing Assets as a Percentage of Gross Assets\n(1)\nRepresents a single-tenant project that expands the existing \nCampus Point by Alexandria Megacampus\n, where we currently have a\n \n55%\n interest\n.

We believe that such tabular presentation promotes a better understanding for investors of \nthe corporate-level decisions made and activities performed that significantly affect comparison of our operating results from period to \nperiod. We also believe that this tabular presentation will supplement for investors an understanding of our disclosures and real estate \noperating results. Gains or losses on sales of real estate and impairments of real estate are related to corporate-level decisions to \ndispose of real estate. Gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt are related to corporate-level financing decisions focused on our \ncapital structure strategy. Significant realized and unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, impairments of real estate \nand non-real estate investments, and acceleration of stock compensation expense due to the resignations of executive officers are not \nrelated to the operating performance of our real estate assets as they result from strategic, corporate-level non-real estate investment \ndecisions and external market conditions. Impairments of non-real estate investments and changes in provision for expected credit \nlosses on financial instruments are not related to the operating performance of our real estate as they represent the write-down of non-\nreal estate investments when their fair values decrease below their respective carrying values due to changes in general market or \nother conditions outside of our control. Significant items, whether a gain or loss, included in the tabular disclosure for current periods \nare described in further detail in Item 2.

The tables below also \nprovide a reconciliation of EPS attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted, the most directly comparable financial \nmeasure presented in accordance with GAAP, to funds from operations per share and funds from operations per share, as adjusted, \nnon-GAAP measures, and other key assumptions included in our updated guidance for the year ending \nDecember 31, 2025\n. There can \nbe no assurance that actual amounts will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations. Refer to our discussion of “Forward-\nlooking statements” and “Trends that may affect our future results” included in the beginning of this Item 2.\nKey changes to our 2025 guidance include the following:\n1)\nThe midpoint of our guidance range for 2025 net (loss) income per share was reduced by \n$3.44\n from \n$0.50\n to \n$(2.94)\n.\n  In \naddition to the items discussed in item 2 below, the update to our guidance range for 2025 net (loss) income per share \nincludes the following:\n•\nPotential additional impairments of real estate (including impairments on stabilized and non-stabilized properties and land) \nthat may be recognized during the three months ending December 31, 2025, ranging from \n$0\n to \n$685 million\n, related to \nassets that could potentially be sold in the fourth quarter of 2025 or 2026, and if such assets meet the held for sale criteria \nduring the three months ending December 31, 2025, considering market factors, buyer ability to perform, our desire to \nproceed with a sale at a particular price, and other factors. As of September 30, 2025, these assets were evaluated under \nthe held for use model and were determined to be recoverable using a weighted-average probability approach. However, \nif any of these assets subsequently meet the criteria to be designated as held for sale, we could recognize impairment \ncharges to reduce the carrying value of these assets to each asset’s fair value less costs to sell.\n•\nPotential additional gain on sales of real estate that may be recognized during the three months ending December 31, \n2025, ranging from \n$0\n to \n$240 million\n, related to assets that may be sold in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n•\nThese potential impairments and gains on sales of real estate will not impact our funds from operations per share \npursuant to the Nareit definition of funds from operations.\n2)\nThe midpoint of our guidance range for 2025 funds from operations per share – diluted, as adjusted, was reduced by \n25 cents\n, \nfrom \n$9.26\n to \n$9.01\n. The primary drivers of the change include the following:\n•\nA \n1.0%\n reduction in projected 2025 same property net operating income and a \n0.9%\n reduction in our projected operating \noccupancy percentage in North America as of December 31, 2025 (at the midpoints of our guidance ranges), primarily due \nto slower than anticipated re-leasing of expiring spaces and lease-up of vacancy in our operating portfolio, reflecting \nreduced demand across the life science industry.\n•\nA reduction in projected 2025 realized gains on non-real estate investments. The midpoint of our revised guidance range \nfor \n2025\n realized gains on non-real estate investments assumes approximately \n$15 million\n in the fourth quarter of 2025, \ncompared to the quarterly average \nr\nealized gains of approximately \n$32 million\n per quarter\n for the nine months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025.\n3)\nOur guidance range for net debt and preferred stock Adjusted EBITDA – fourth quarter of 2025 annualized increased from less \nthan or equal to 5.2x to a range of \n5.5x to 6.0x\n. The primary drivers of the change include the following:\n•\nA \n$450 million\n reduction in the midpoint of our guidance range for 2025 dispositions and sales of partial interests. This \nincludes expected delays in the closing of certain dispositions that are now anticipated to be completed during the first half \nof 2026.\n•\nA reduction in projected Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2025 related to the changes in same property \nperformance (net operating income) and realized gains on non-real estate investments as described above.\n98\nProjected \n2025\n Earnings per Share and Funds From Operations \nper Share Attributable to Alexandria’s Common Stockholders \n– Diluted\nAs of 10/27/25\nAs of 7/21/25\nKey Changes\nto Midpoint\nNet (loss) income per share\n(1)\n$(5.68) to $(0.20)\n$0.40 to $0.60\n(2)\nDepreciation and amortization of real estate assets\n7.05\n7.05\nGain on sales of real estate\n(0.14) to (1.54)\n(0.08)\n(2)\nImpairment of real estate – rental properties and land\n(3)\n6.69 to 2.67\n0.77\n(2)\nAllocation of unvested restricted stock awards\n(0.03)\n(0.03)\nFunds from operations per share\n(4)\n$7.89 to $7.95\n$8.11 to $8.31\nUnrealized losses on non-real estate investments\n0.42\n0.53\nImpairment of non-real estate investments\n0.45\n0.30\nImpairment of real estate\n0.23\n0.23\nAllocation to unvested restricted stock awards\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\nFunds from operations per share, as adjusted\n(4)\n$8.98 to $9.04\n$9.16 to $9.36\nMidpoint\n$9.01\n$9.26\nReduction of \n25 cents\n(2)\n(1)\nExcludes unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments after \nSeptember 30, 2025\n \nthat are required to be recognized in earnings and are excluded from \nfunds from operations per share, as adjusted.\n(2)\nRefer to the discussion regarding key changes to our 2025 guidance above for additional details.\n(3)\nRefer to Note 3 – “Investments in real estate” to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for additional information.\n(4)\nRefer to “\nFunds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders\n” under “\nDefinitions \nand reconciliations\n” in Item 2 for additional information.\nKey Assumptions\n(1)\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nAs of 10/27/25\nAs of 7/21/25\nKey Changes\nto Midpoint\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nOperating occupancy percentage in North America as of \nDecember 31, 2025\n90.0%\n91.6%\n(2)\n90.9%\n92.5%\n90 bps reduction\nLease renewals and re-leasing of space:\nRental rate changes\n7.0%\n15.0%\n(3)\n9.0%\n17.0%\n200 bps reduction\n(2)\nRental rate changes (cash basis)\n0.5%\n8.5%\n0.5%\n8.5%\nNo change\nSame property performance:\nNet operating income changes\n(4.7)%\n(2.7)%\n(3.7)%\n(1.7)%\n100 bps reduction\nNet operating income changes (cash basis)\n(1.2)%\n0.8%\n(1.2)%\n0.8%\nNo change\nStraight-line rent revenue\n$\n75\n$\n95\n$\n96\n$\n116\n$21 million reduction\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n$\n112\n$\n127\n$\n112\n$\n127\nNo Change\nCapitalization of interest\n$\n320\n$\n350\n$\n320\n$\n350\nInterest expense\n(4)\n$\n195\n$\n225\n$\n185\n$\n215\n$10 million increase\n(3)\nRealized gains on non-real estate investments\n(5)\n$\n100\n$\n120\n$\n100\n$\n130\n$5 million reduction\n(1)\nOur assumptions presented in the table above are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed as “Forward-looking statements” under \nPart I; “Item 1A.

To the extent our full-year earnings guidance is updated during the year, we will provide additional disclosure supporting reasons for any \nsignificant changes to such guidance\n.\n(2)\nOur guidance assumes an approximate \n1%\n benefit related to a range of assets with vacancy that could potentially qualify for classification as held for sale by \nDecember 31, 2025. These assets have not yet reached the criteria for held for sale designation as of September 30, 2025.\n(3)\nIn October 2025, we executed a one-year lease extension aggregating \n247,743\n RSF with an investment-grade rated government institution tenant at a recently acquired \noffice property in our Canada market.\n At acquisition, this building was originally targeted for a future change in use, but we instead renewed the existing tenant through \nthe beginning of 2027, with no incremental capital investment. We continue to evaluate options to convert this space, subject to market conditions. \nThe impact from this \nrenewal on our 2025 rental rate changes is anticipated to result in a reduction of approximately \n2.0%\n.\n(4)\nThe increase in the midpoint of our guidance range for 2025 interest expense is primarily due to the \n$450 million\n reduction to the midpoint of our guidance range for \n2025 dispositions and sales of partial interests, which includes expected delays in the closing of certain dispositions that are now anticipated to be completed in the first \nhalf of 2026.\n(5)\nRepresents realized gains and losses included in funds from operations per share – diluted, as adjusted, and excludes significant impairments realized on non-real \nestate investments, if any. \nThe midpoint of our revised guidance range for \n2025\n realized gains on non-real estate investments assumes approximately \n$15 million\n in the \nfourth quarter of 2025, compared to the quarterly average realized gains of approximately \n$32 million\n per quarter for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

The following is an initial summary of key items \nthat are expected to impact 2026 results: \n•\nCore operations \n– Slower demand across the life science sector and increased supply for life science real estate could negatively \nimpact future occupancy. Additional considerations include the following:\n•\nSame property net operating income decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months \nended September 30, 2024 of \n6.0%\n \nr\neflects a decline relative to the first half of 2025. Refer to “Same properties” in Item 2 for \nadditional details. \n•\nOperating occupancy has decreased four consecutive quarters from\n \n94.7%\n as of September 30, 2024\n to\n \n90.6%\n as \nof \nSeptember 30, 2025. \n•\nBefore the benefit of excluding assets designated as held for sale which contained vacancy, occupancy during the three \nmonths ended September 30, 2025 declined \n1.1%\n compared to the three months ended June 30, 2025, primarily related to \nlease expirations during the third quarter of 2025. These lease expirations resulting in the \n1.1%\n decline in occupancy \npreviously generated annual rental revenue aggregating approximately \n$29.0 million\n and had a weighted-average lease \nexpiration date at the end of \nJuly 2025\n. We are currently marketing these spaces.\n•\nOur guidance for operating occupancy percentage in North America as of December 31, 2025 assumes an approximate \n1%\n \nbenefit related to a range of assets with vacancy that could potentially qualify for designation as held for sale by December 31, \n2025, but that have not yet qualified as of September 30, 2025. After considering this potential adjustment, the midpoint of our \nguidance range for occupancy as of December 31, 2025 implies an\n \n80\n b\nps decline in operating occupancy percentage during \nthe fourth quarter of 2025.\n•\nThere are key lease expirations primarily located in the Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area, and San Diego markets \naggregating \n1.2 million\n RSF with a weighted-average lease expiration date of \nMarch 19, 2026\n and annual rental revenue \naggregating \n$81 million\n, which are expected to become vacant upon lease expiration. We expect downtime on these spaces \nranging from \n6 to 24 \nmonths on a weighted-average basis. \nRefer to “Summary of contractual lease expirations” in Item 2 for \nadditional details. \n•\nCapitalized interest\n – There is approximately\n \n$4.2 billion\n of average real estate basis capitalized \nduring the nine months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025, related to future pipeline projects undergoing critical pre-construction activities, including various phases of \nentitlement, design, site work, and other activities necessary to begin aboveground vertical construction. We expect these projects \nto reach anticipated pre-construction milestones on\n \nApril 14, 2026\n, on a weighted-average real estate investment basis. We will \nevaluate, on an asset-by-asset basis, whether to (i) proceed with additional pre-construction and/or construction activities based on \nleasing demand and/or market conditions, (ii) pause future investments, or (iii) consider the potential dispositions of these real \nestate assets. If we cease activities necessary to prepare a project for its intended use, costs related to such project, including \ninterest, payroll, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the construction of Class A/A+ \nproperties, will be expensed as incurred. Refer to “Average real estate basis used for capitalization of interest” in Item 2 for \nadditional details.\n•\nRealized gains on non-real estate investments \n– T\nhe midpoint of our revised guidance range for 2025 realized gains on non-real \nestate investments assumes approximately \n$15 million\n for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to the quarterly average realized \ngains of approximately \n$32 million\n per quarter for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. \nRefer to “Note 7 – Investments” to \nour unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for additional details.  \n•\nGeneral and administrative expenses \n– Over the past several years, we have implemented comprehensive measures to reduce our \nexpenditures across our organization, including our general and administrative expenses. These initiatives are expected to \ngenerate a reduction in general and administrative expenses of approximately\n \n$49 million\n, or \n29%\n, during the year ending \nDecember 31, 2025 (at the midpoint of our 2025 guidance range) compared to the year ended December 31, 2024. Given that \nsome of these costs savings are expected to be temporary in nature, we anticipate approximately half of the cost reductions \nexpected to be achieved in 2025 will continue in 2026.\n•\nDispositions and equity-type capital\n•\nAs of October 27, 2025, our share of pending dispositions subject to non-refundable deposits, signed letters of intent, and/or \npurchase and sale agreement negotiations aggregated \n$1.0 billion\n. \nWe expect these dispositions to close in late fourth quarter \nof 2025; therefore, the corresponding reduction in EBITDA is expected to impact the first quarter of 2026. Refer to \n“Dispositions and sale of partial interests” in Item 2 for additional details. \n•\nWe expect construction spending in 2026 to be similar or slightly higher than the\n \n$1.75 billion\n midpoint of our guidance range \nfor 2025\n construction in order to complete our active construction projects and significant revenue- and non-revenue-\nenhancing capital expenditures necessary to lease vacant space. Given the factors previously described that could negatively \nimpact EBITDA, we may require significant equity-type capital to manage our leverage profile. \n•\nWe expect a significant source of funding to come from the sale of non-core assets in 2026. We anticipate an end to our large-\nscale non-core asset sales program in 2026 or early 2027.\n As of September 30, 2025, \n77%\n of our annual rental revenue is \nfrom our Megacampus™ platform\n, and we expect this percentage to continue to grow over time. \n•\nDividends and net cash provided by operating activities after dividends\n•\nFrom 2013 to 2025, dividends per share and funds from operations per share, as adjusted have been highly correlated, with \ncumulative increases of \n102%\n and \n105%\n, respectively. \n•\nThe factors previously described could lead to a reduction in funds from operations per share, as adjusted and net cash \nprovided by operating activities. At the current dividend rate, the amount of net cash provided by operating activities after \npayment of dividends available to recycle and address our 2026 capital needs could be reduced. As a result, we expect our \nBoard of Directors to carefully evaluate our 2026 dividend strategy.\n101\nConsolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures\nWe present components of balance sheet and operating results information for the noncontrolling interest share of our \nconsolidated real estate joint ventures and for our share of investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures to help investors \nestimate balance sheet and operating results information related to our partially owned entities. These amounts are estimated by \ncomputing, for each joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, the noncontrolling interest percentage of each financial \nitem to arrive at the cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented. In addition, for our real estate joint ventures \nthat we do not control and do not consolidate, we apply our economic ownership percentage to the unconsolidated real estate joint \nventures to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented. Refer to Note 4 – “Consolidated and unconsolidated real \nestate joint ventures” to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for further discussion.\nConsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures\n(1)\nProperty/Market/Submarket\nNoncontrolling\nInterest Share\nOperating RSF\nat 100%\n50 and 60 Binney Street/Greater Boston/Cambridge/Inner Suburbs\n66.0%\n532,395\n75/125 Binney Street/Greater Boston/Cambridge/Inner Suburbs\n60.0%\n388,270\n100 and 225 Binney Street and 300 Third Street/Greater Boston/Cambridge/Inner Suburbs\n70.0%\n870,641\n15 Necco Street/Greater Boston/Seaport Innovation District\n43.3%\n345,996\n285, 299, 307, and 345 Dorchester Avenue/Greater Boston/Seaport Innovation District\n40.0%\n—\n(2)\nAlexandria Center\n®\n for Science and Technology – Mission Bay/San Francisco Bay Area/\nMission Bay\n(3)\n75.0%\n548,215\n601, 611, 651\n(2)\n, 681, 685, and 701 Gateway Boulevard/San Francisco Bay Area/\nSouth San Francisco\n50.0%\n874,234\n751 Gateway Boulevard/San Francisco Bay Area/South San Francisco\n49.0%\n230,592\n211 and 213 East Grand Avenue/San Francisco Bay Area/South San Francisco\n70.0%\n300,930\n500 Forbes Boulevard/San Francisco Bay Area/South San Francisco\n90.0%\n155,685\nAlexandria Center\n®\n for Life Science – Millbrae/San Francisco Bay Area/South San Francisco\n51.5%\n285,346\n3215 Merryfield Row/San Diego/Torrey Pines\n70.0%\n170,523\nCampus Point by Alexandria/San Diego/University Town Center\n(2)(4)\n45.0%\n(5)\n1,212,414\n5200 Illumina Way/San Diego/University Town Center\n49.0%\n792,687\n9625 Towne Centre Drive/San Diego/University Town Center\n70.0%\n163,648\nSD Tech by Alexandria/San Diego/Sorrento Mesa\n(2)(6)\n50.0%\n829,437\nSummers Ridge Science Park/San Diego/Sorrento Mesa\n(7)\n70.0%\n316,531\n1201 and 1208 Eastlake Avenue East/Seattle/Lake Union\n70.0%\n206,134\n400 Dexter Avenue North/Seattle/Lake Union\n70.0%\n290,754\n800 Mercer Street/Seattle/Lake Union\n40.0%\n—\n(2)\nUnconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures\nProperty/Market/Submarket\nOur Ownership \nShare\n(8)\nOperating RSF\nat 100%\n1655 and 1725 Third Street/San Francisco Bay Area/Mission Bay\n10.0%\n586,208\n1450 Research Boulevard/Maryland/Rockville\n73.2%\n(9)\n42,012\n101 West Dickman Street/Maryland/Beltsville\n58.4%\n(9)\n142,933\n Refer to “Joint venture financial information” under “Definitions and reconciliations” in Item 2 for additional details.\n(1)\nIn addition to the real estate joint ventures listed, we have \none\n consolidated real estate joint venture in the Greater Boston market in which a partner holds a \n$48.7 million\n \nredeemable noncontrolling interest earning a fixed return. \n(2)\nRepresents a property currently under construction or in our future development and redevelopment pipeline.

D\nuring the three months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock. As of the date of this report, the approximate value of \nshares authorized and\n remaining under this program was \n$241.8 million\n. Subject to\n market conditions, we may consider repurchasing additional shares of our common \nstock.\n(3)\nIn August 2025, we repaid a secured construction loan held by our development project at 99 Coolidge Avenue in our Cambridge/Inner Suburbs submarket. Refer to \nNote 10 – “Secured and unsecured senior debt” to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for additional information.\nThe key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above include favorable real estate transaction and \ncapital market environments, performance of our core operating properties, lease-up and delivery of current and future development \nand redevelopment projects, and leasing activity. Our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and \nuncertainties, including those discussed as “Forward-looking statements” under Part I; “Item 1A. Risk factors”; and “Item 7. \nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year \nended \nDecember 31, 2024\n; as well as in “Item 1A. Risk factors”; and “Item 2. Trends that may affect our future results” within “Part II – \nOther information” of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We expect to update our forecast for key sources and uses of capital on a \nquarterly basis. \n108\nSources of capital\nNet cash provided by operating activities after dividends\nWe expect to retain \n$425 million\n to \n$525 million\n of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock \ndividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the year ending \nDecember 31, 2025\n, \nexcluding the payment of our final \ninstallmen\nt of\n \n$135.0 million\n made in January 20\n25 for the ground lease at the Alexandria Technology Square\n®\n Megacampus\n.\n For \npurposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities representing timing differences are excluded. For the year \nending \nDecember 31, 2025\n, we expect our recently delivered projects, our development and redevelopment projects expected to be \ndelivered, and contributions from Same Properties to contribute to income from rentals, net operating income, and cash flows. We \nanticipate contractual near-term growth in annual net operating income (cash basis) of\n \n$50 million\n related to the commencement of \ncontractual rents on the projects recently placed into service that are near the end of their initial free rent period. Refer to “\nCash flows\n” \nin Item 2 for a discussion of cash flows provided by operating activities for the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n.\nDebt\nWe expect to fund a portion of our capital needs for \n2025\n from issuances under our commercial paper program, issuances of \nunsecured senior notes payable, and/or borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit.\nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, \nour unsecured senior line of credit, which matures in\n \n2030\n, including extension options under our \ncontrol, had aggregate commitments of \n$5.0 billion\n and bore an interest rate of SOFR plus \n0.855%\n. In addition to the cost of borrowing, \nthe unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of \n0.145%\n b\nased on the aggregate commitments outstanding. \nBased upon our ability to achieve certain annual sustainability targets, the interest rate and facility fee rate are also subject to\n upward or \ndownward adjustments of up to \nfour\n basis points with respect to the interest rate and up to \none\n basis point with respect to the facility fee \nrate\n. \nBased on certain sustainability metrics achieved in accordance with the terms of our unsecured senior line of credit \nagreement, \nthe borrowing rate was reduced by \ntwo\n basis points to \nS\nOFR plus \n0.855%\n, from SOFR plus \n0.875%\n, and the facility fee \nwas reduced by \n0.5\n basis point to \n0.145%\n from \n0.15%\n.\n As of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, \nw\ne had \nno\n outstanding balance on our unsecured \nline of credit. \nOur commercial paper program provides us with the ability to issue up to \n$2.5 billion\n of commercial paper notes with a maturity \nof generally \n30\n days or less and with a maximum maturity of \n397\n days from the date of issuanc\ne.\n Our commercial paper program is \nbacked by our unsecured senior line of credit, and at all times we expect to retain a minimum undrawn amount of borrowing capacity \nunder our unsecured senior line of credit equal to any outstanding balance under our commercial paper program. We use borrowings \nunder the program to fund short-term capital needs. The notes issued under our commercial paper program are sold under customary \nterms in the commercial paper market. They are typically issued at a discount to par, representing a yield to maturity dictated by market \nconditions at the time of issuance. In the event we are unable to issue commercial paper notes or refinance outstanding commercial \npaper notes under terms equal to or more favorable than those under the unsecured senior line of credit, we expect to borrow under the \nunsecured senior line of credit. The commercial paper notes sold during the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n were issued at a \nweighted-average yield to maturity\n o\nf \n4.64%\n.\n \nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, w\ne had \n$1.5 billion\n of c\nommercial paper notes outstanding\n.\nIn February 2025, we issued \n$550.0 million\n of unsecured senior notes payable, due \n2035\n, with an interest rate of \n5.50%\n. \nThe following table presents our average debt outstanding and weighted-average interest rates during the \nthree and nine \nmonths ended September 30, 2025\n (dollars in thousands): \nAverage Debt Outstanding\nWeighted-Average Interest Rate\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2025\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nLong-term fixed-rate debt\n$\n12,121,219\n$\n12,290,203\n3.88%\n3.86%\nShort-term variable-rate unsecured \nsenior line of credit and commercial \npaper program\n \ndebt\n1,503,453\n935,353\n4.64\n4.64\nBlended average interest rate\n13,624,672\n13,225,556\n3.96\n3.92\nLoan fee amortization and annual facility \nfee related to unsecured senior line of \ncredit\nN/A\nN/A\n0.14\n0.13\nTotal/weighted average\n$\n13,624,672\n$\n13,225,556\n4.10%\n4.05%\n109\nReal estate dispositions and sales of partial interests\nWe expect to continue to focus on the disciplined execution of select sales of real estate. Future sales will provide an important \nsource of capital to fund our development and redevelopment projects and opportunistic share repurchases and also provide significant \ncapital for growth. We may also consider additional sales of partial interests in core Class A/A+ properties, development projects, and/or \nland. For the year ending December 31, \n2025\n, we expect real estate dispositions and sales of partial interests in real estate assets to \nrange from\n \n$1.10 billion\n to \n$1.90 billion\n.\n \nThe amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary \ndepending upon the amount of EBITDA associated with the assets sold.\nRefer to Note 3 – “Investments in real estate,” Note 4 – “Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures,” and \nNote 14 – “Stockholders’ equity” to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 and to “Dispositions and sales of partial \ninterests” in Item 2 for additional information on our real estate dispositions.\nAs a REIT, we are generally subject to a 100% tax on the net income from real estate asset sales that the IRS characterizes as \n“prohibited transactions.” We do not expect our sales will be categorized as prohibited transactions. However, unless we meet certain \n“safe harbor” requirements, whether a real estate asset sale is a “prohibited transaction” will be based on the facts and circumstances \nof the sale. Our real estate asset sales may not always meet such “safe harbor” requirements. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk factors” in our \nannual report on Form 10-K for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n for additional information about the “prohibited transaction” tax.\nCommon equity transactions\nDuring the \nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2025\n, we have not issued any common stock under our ATM \nprogram.\n \nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, the remaining aggregate amount available under our ATM program for future sales of common \nstock was \n$1.47 billion\n.\n \nOther sources\nAs a well-known seasoned issuer, we may, from time to time, issue securities at our discretion based on our needs and market \nconditions, including, as necessary, to balance our use of incremental debt capital. \nAdditionally, we, together with joint venture partners, hold interests in real estate joint ventures that we consolidate in our \nfinancial statements. These existing joint ventures provide significant equity capital to fund a portion of our future construction spending, \nand our joint venture partners may also contribute equity into these entities for financing-related activities. \nFrom \nOctober 1, 2025\n \nthrough December 31, \n2027\n and beyond, we expect to receive capital contributions aggregating \n$166.9 million\n from existing \nconsolidated real estate joint venture partners to fund construction\n. During the year ending December 31, \n2025\n, contributions from \nnoncontrolling interests from existing joint venture partners are expected to aggregate to up to \n$230.0 million\n at the midpoint of our \nguidance range for 2025 construction spending\n.\n110\nUses of capital\nSummary of capital expenditures\nOne of our primary uses of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction of properties. \nW\ne currently have projects in our development and redevelopment pipeline aggregating \n4.2 million\n RSF\n of Class A/A+ properties \nundergoing construction and \none\n \n100%\n pre-leased\n committed near-term project expected to commence construction in the next year\n. \nWe incur capitalized construction costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and other construction activities. We \nalso incur additional capitalized project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential \nto the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project, during periods when activities necessary to prepare \nan asset for its intended use are in progress. Refer to “\nNew\n Class A/A+ development and redevelopment properties: current projects” \nand “\nSummary of capital expenditures\n” in Item 2 for additional information on our capital expenditures.\nWe capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period in which activities necessary to prepare an asset for \nits intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. Capitalized \ninterest, classified in investments in real estate in our consolidated balance sheets, \na\nggregated \n$248.6 million\n f\nor the \nnine months \nended September 30, 2025\n, consistent with \n$249.4 million\n \ncapitalized during \nnine months ended September 30, 2024\n. This reflects a \nconsistent weighted-average capitalized cost basis of\n \n$8.2 billion\n for the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n, as compared to \n$8.1 billion\n for the \nnine months ended September 30, 2024\n.   \nProperty taxes, insurance on real estate, and indirect project costs, such as construction, administration, legal fees, and office \ncosts that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is \nundergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. We capitalized payroll and other indirect costs related to development, \nredevelopment, pre-construction, and construction projects aggregating\n \n$69.6 million\n and \n$76.8 million\n, and property taxes, insurance \non real estate, and indirect project costs\n aggregating\n \n$111.7 million\n \nand\n \n$96.5 million\n during \nthe \nnine months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025\n and \n2024\n, respectively.\n \nPre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of \nconstruction of aboveground building improvements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time \nrequired to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and \nare required for the vertical construction of buildings. Should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the \ninterest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct and indirect project costs related to the asset would be expensed as incurred. \nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nFluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total \nexpenses and net income. For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction \nactivities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased \nby approximately \n$43.0 million\n for the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n.\nWe use third-party brokers to assist in our leasing activity, who are paid on a contingent basis upon successful leasing. We are \nrequired to capitalize initial direct costs related to successful leasing transactions that result directly from and are essential to the lease \ntransaction and would not have been incurred had that lease transaction not been successfully executed. During the \nnine months \nended September 30, 2025\n, we capitalized total initial direct leasing costs of \n$95.7 million\n. Costs that we incur to negotiate or arrange a \nlease regardless of its outcome, such as fixed employee compensation, tax, or legal advice to negotiate lease terms, and other costs, \nare expensed as incurred.\nReal estate acquisitions and common stock repurchase program\nUnder our common stock repurchase program \nauthorized in December 2024, \nwe may repurchase up to \n$500.0 million\n of our\n \ncommon stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise through \nDecember 31, 2025\n.\n \n•\nDuring the \nthree months ended September 30, 2025\n, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock.\n•\nDuring the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n, we repurchased \n2.2 million\n shares of common stock for an aggregate \nvalue of \n$208 million\n at an average price per share of \n$96.71\n.\n•\nAs of the date of this report, the approximate value of shares authorized and remaining under this program was \n$241.8 \nmillion\n.\nWe have not made any real estate acquisitions during the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n.\nFor the year ending December 31, \n2025\n, we expect real estate acquisitions and other opportunistic uses of capital, including \ncommon stock repurchases, to aggregate\n up to \n$500 million\n. \n111\nDividends\nDuring the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n and \n2024\n, we paid common stock dividends of\n \n$684.4 million\n and \n$671.4 million\n,\n respectively. The \nincrease\n of \n$13.1 million\n in dividends paid on our common stock for the \nnine months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, compared to the \nnine months ended September 30, 2024\n, was primarily due to an increase in the related \ndividends to\n \n$3.96\n \nper common share\n paid for the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n from \n$3.84\n per common share\n paid for the \nnine months ended September 30, 2024\n. We have historically funded the payment of our common stock dividends using net cash \nprovided by operating activities. We expect to continue funding future quarterly common stock dividends from net cash provided by \noperating activities, which may be supplemented by proceeds from periodic asset dispositions, issuances of additional debt and/or \nequity securities, and borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and/or our commercial paper program. Future dividends are \nat the discretion of our Board and subject to various considerations, including net income, cash flows, capital requirements, debt \ncovenants, market conditions, dividend yield, taxable income, payout ratios, and other factors. There can be no assurance that we will \ncontinue our historical dividend per share growth or maintain dividends at the current level.\nUnsecured senior notes payable and unsecured senior line of credit\nThe requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our unsecured senior \nnotes payable as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n were as follows: \nCovenant Ratios\n(1)\nRequirement\nSeptember 30, 2025\nTotal Debt to Total Assets\nLess than or equal to 60%\n32%\nSecured Debt to Total Assets\nLess than or equal to 40%\n—%\nConsolidated EBITDA\n(2)\n to Interest Expense\nGreater than or equal to 1.5x\n9.8x\nUnencumbered Total Asset Value to Unsecured Debt\nGreater than or equal to 150%\n302%\n(1)\nAll covenant ratio titles utilize terms as defined in the respective debt agreements.\n(2)\nThe calculation of consolidated EBITDA is based on the definitions contained in our loan agreements and is not directly comparable to the computation of EBITDA as \ndescribed in Exchange Act Release No. 47226.\nIn addition, the terms of the indentures, among other things, limit the ability of the Company, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, \nL.P., and the Company’s subsidiaries to (i) consummate a merger, or consolidate, or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets \nand (ii) incur certain secured or unsecured indebtedness.\nThe requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our unsecured senior line \nof credit as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n were as follows:\nCovenant Ratios\n(1)\nRequirement\nSeptember 30, 2025\nLeverage Ratio\nLess than or equal to 60.0%\n33.6%\nSecured Debt Ratio\nLess than or equal to 45.0%\n—%\nFixed-Charge Coverage Ratio\nGreater than or equal to 1.50x\n3.58x\nUnsecured Interest Coverage Ratio\nGreater than or equal to 1.75x\n8.54x\n(1)\nAll covenant ratio titles utilize terms as defined in the credit agreement.\nEstimated interest payments\nEstimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt are calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including interest \npayment dates and scheduled maturity dates. As of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n,\n \n88.6%\n \nof our debt was fixed-rate debt\n.\n For additional \ninformation regarding our debt, refer to Note 10 – “Secured and unsecured senior debt” to our unaudited consolidated financial \nstatements in Item 1.\n112\nGround lease obligations\nGround lease obligations as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n included leases for \n31\n \nof our properties and accounted for approximately \n8%\n of our total number of properties. \nAmong these\n \n31\n properties, \n17\n properties are subject to ground leases with a weighted-average \nremaining lease term of \n40\n years\n, including extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. \nThese\n leases are with a single \nlessor in our Greater Stanford submarket with whom we have extended \nthree\n ground leases over the past 10 years. \nOur remaining \n14\n properties subject to ground leases are located across multiple submarkets and have remaining lease terms \nranging from approximately \n45\n to \n81\n years\n. The weighted-average remaining lease term of these ground leases is\n \n73\n years\n, including \nextension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise.\nIn many cases, we seek to extend our ground leases well ahead of their scheduled contractual expirations. If we are \nsuccessful in extending ground leases, we could see significant up-front or increased recurring future payments to the ground lessor \nand/or increased ground lease expense, which may require us to increase our capital funding needs.\nOperating lease agreements\nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, the remaining contractual payments under ground and office lease agreements in which we are the \nlessee aggregated\n \n$757.9 million\n and \n$20.9 million\n,\n respectively. As of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, our operating lease liability, calculated as \nthe present value of the remaining payments aggregating \n$778.8 million\n under our operating lease agreements, including our extension \noptions that we are reasonably certain to exercise, was \n$362.0 million\n and\n was classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and \nother liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. As of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, the weighted-average remaining lease term of operating \nleases in which we are the lessee was approximately \n54 years\n, including extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, \nand the weighted-average discount rate was \n4.7%\n. Our corresponding operating lease right-of-use assets, adjusted for initial direct \nleasing costs and other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, aggregated \n$713.4 million\n. \nWe classify the right-of-use asset in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to “\nLease accounting\n” in Note 2 – \n“Summary of significant accounting policies” to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for additional information.\nCommitments\nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing \ndevelopment, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated\n \n$1.1 billion\n. We expect payments for these \nobligations to occur over \none\n to \nthree\n year\ns, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We may have the ability to cease \nthe construction of certain projects, which would result in the reduction of our commitments. In addition, we have letters of credit and \nperformance obligations aggregati\nn\ng \n$5.3 million\n.\nWe are committed to funding approximately \n$377.0 million\n related to our non-real estate investments. These funding \ncommitments are primarily associated with our investments in privately held entities that report NAV and expire at various dates over \nthe next \n11 years\n, with a weighted-average expiration of \n7.9 years\n \nas of September 30, 2025\n.\n  \nOur former joint venture partner in the Greater Boston market has an option, subject to certain conditions, to obtain a \n \n$50 million\n secured loan\n from us, which, if the option is exercised, will bear interest at\n \nSOFR plus 6.5%\n, with a floor of 9.0%\n and\n a term \nnot to exceed \nfive\n years.\n \nAs of September 30, 2025\n, the option has not been exercised. \n In July 2025, we amended the agreement for our consolidated joint venture at 99 Coolidge Avenue in our Cambridge/Inner \nSuburbs submarket. Pursuant to the amended agreement, our partner has a put option beginning January 2026 to require us to \npurchase its redeemable noncontrolling interest \naggregating \n$48.7 million\n plus any unpaid distributions accruing at a fixed annual rate \nof \n4.05%\n. \nExposure to environmental liabilities\nIn connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain \nthe existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not \nrevealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of \noperations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I \nenvironmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to \ncertain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.\n113\nForeign currency translation gains and losses\nThe following table presents the change in accumulated other comprehensive \nloss\n attributable to Alexandria Real Estate \nEquities, Inc.’s stockholders during the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n primarily due to the changes in the foreign exchange \nrates for our real estate investments in Canada (in thousands). We reclassify unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses \ninto net income as we dispose of these holdings. \nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n(46,252)\nOther comprehensive income before reclassifications\n14,049\nNet other comprehensive income\n14,049\nBalance as of September 30, 2025\n$\n(32,203)\nInflation\nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, approximately\n \n91%\n of our leases\n (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which \nrequire tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and \nother operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately \n97%\n of our leases (on an annual rental \nrevenue basis) contained effective annual rent escalations approximating \n3%\n th\nat were either fixed or indexed based on a consumer \nprice index or other indices. Accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to \nsignificant risks from inflation. A period of inflation, however, could cause an increase in the cost of issuing new unsecured senior notes \npayable and our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper \nprogram, and secured loans held by our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.\n114\nIssuer and guarantor subsidiary summarized financial information\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (the “Issuer”) has sold certain debt securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, \nas amended, that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P. (the “LP” or the “Guarantor \nSubsidiary”), an indirectly 100% owned subsidiary of the Issuer. The Issuer’s other subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, the \nsubsidiaries that own substantially all of its real estate (collectively, the “Combined Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”), will not provide a \nguarantee of such securities, including the subsidiaries that are partially or 100% owned by the LP. The following summarized financial \ninformation presents, on a combined basis, balance sheet information as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n and \nDecember 31, 2024\n, and results \nof operations and comprehensive income for the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n and year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n for the \nIssuer and the Guarantor Subsidiary. The information presented below excludes eliminations necessary to arrive at the information on a \nconsolidated basis. In presenting the summarized financial statements, the equity method of accounting has been applied to (i) the \nIssuer’s interests in the Guarantor Subsidiary, (ii) the Guarantor Subsidiary’s interests in the Combined Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, \nand (iii) the Combined Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries’ interests in the Guarantor Subsidiary, where applicable, even though all such \nsubsidiaries meet the requirements to be consolidated under GAAP. All assets and liabilities have been allocated to the Issuer and the \nGuarantor Subsidiary generally based on legal entity ownership.\nThe following tables present combined summarized financial information as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n and \nDecember 31, 2024\n \nand for the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n and \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n for the Issuer and Guarantor Subsidiary. \nAmounts provided do not represent our total consolidated amounts (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nAssets:\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n139,186\n$\n103,993\nOther assets\n180,796\n153,913\nTotal assets\n$\n319,982\n$\n257,906\nLiabilities:\nUnsecured senior notes payable\n$\n12,044,999\n$\n12,094,465\nUnsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper\n1,548,542\n—\nOther liabilities\n540,406\n542,322\nTotal liabilities\n$\n14,133,947\n$\n12,636,787\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30, 2025\nYear Ended \nDecember 31, 2024\nTotal revenues\n$\n34,489\n$\n59,023\nTotal expenses\n(248,954)\n(349,437)\nNet loss\n(214,465)\n(290,414)\nNet income attributable to unvested restricted stock awards\n(7,452)\n(13,394)\nNet loss attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders\n$\n(221,917)\n$\n(303,808)\nAs of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n,\n \n359\n of our \n375\n p\nroperties\n \nwere held indirectly by the REIT’s wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, \nAlexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P.\nCritical accounting estimates\nRefer to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n for a discussion of our critical accounting \nestimates related to recognition of real estate acquired, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of non-real estate investments, and \nmonitoring of tenant credit quality.\n115\nDefinitions and reconciliations\nThis section contains additional information on certain non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations from the most \ndirectly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and the reasons why we use these \nsupplemental measures of performance and believe they provide useful information to investors, as well as the definitions of other \nterms used in this report.\nFunds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common \nstockholders\nGAAP-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish \nover time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the \nNareit Board of Governors established funds from operations as an improved measurement tool. Since its introduction, funds from \noperations has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among equity REITs. We believe that funds from operations is \nhelpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. Moreover, we believe that funds from operations, as \nadjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without \nhaving to account for differences recognized because of real estate acquisition and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital \nstructure, capital market transactions, variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control, or other \ncorporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties. \nThe 2018 White Paper published by the Nareit Board of Governors (the “Nareit White Paper”) defines funds from operations as \nnet income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments of real estate, plus \ndepreciation and amortization of operating real estate assets, and after adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated \npartnerships and real estate joint ventures. Impairments represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability \nperiod is less than the carrying value due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating \nperformance of the properties during the corresponding period.\nWe compute funds from operations, as adjusted, as funds from operations calculated in accordance with the Nareit White \nPaper, excluding significant gains, losses, and impairments realized on non-real estate investments, unrealized gains or losses on non-\nreal estate investments, impairments of real estate primarily consisting of right-of-use assets and pre-acquisition costs related to \nprojects that we decided to no longer pursue, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, changes in the provision for expected \ncredit losses on financial instruments, significant termination fees, acceleration of stock compensation expense due to the resignations \nof executive officers, deal costs, the income tax effect related to such items, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our \nunvested restricted stock awards. We compute the amount that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards with nonforfeitable \ndividends using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, we allocate net income (after amounts attributable to noncontrolling \ninterests) to common stockholders and to unvested restricted stock awards with nonforfeitable dividends by applying the respective \nweighted-average shares outstanding during each quarter-to-date and year-to-date period. This may result in a difference of the \nsummation of the quarter-to-date and year-to-date amounts. Neither funds from operations nor funds from operations, as adjusted, \nshould be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indications of financial performance, or to \ncash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the \navailability of funds for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. \nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) to funds from operations for the share of consolidated real estate joint \nventures attributable to noncontrolling interests and our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures for the \nthree and nine months \nended September 30, 2025\n (in thousands):\nNoncontrolling Interest Share of \nConsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures\nOur Share of Unconsolidated \nReal Estate Joint Ventures\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2025\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nNet income (loss)\n$\n34,909\n$\n127,323\n$\n201\n$\n(9,327)\nDepreciation and amortization of real \nestate assets\n45,327\n114,785\n852\n2,848\nGain on sale of interest of \nunconsolidated JV\n—\n—\n(458)\n(458)\nImpairment of real estate\n—\n—\n—\n8,673\nFunds from operations\n$\n80,236\n$\n242,108\n$\n595\n$\n1,736\n116\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common \nstockholders, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, including our share of amounts from \nconsolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, to funds from operations attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, \nInc.’s common stockholders – diluted, and funds from operations attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common \nstockholders – diluted, as adjusted, and the related per share amounts for the \nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2025\n and \n2024\n (in thousands, except per share amounts).

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated \nas earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses \non early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, impairments of real estate, changes in provision for expected \ncredit losses on financial instruments, and significant termination fees. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes unrealized gains or losses and \nsignificant realized gains or losses and impairments that result from our non-real estate investments. These non-real estate investment \namounts are classified in our consolidated statements of operations outside of total revenues.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with relevant and useful information as it allows investors to evaluate the \noperating performance of our business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and \nfinancing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments, our capital structure, capital market transactions, and \nvariances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. For example, we exclude gains or losses on the early \nextinguishment of debt to allow investors to measure our performance independent of our indebtedness and capital structure. We \nbelieve that adjusting for the effects of impairments and gains or losses on sales of real estate, significant impairments and realized \ngains or losses on non-real estate investments, changes in provision for expected credit losses on financial instruments, and significant \ntermination fees allows investors to evaluate performance from period to period on a consistent basis without having to account for \ndifferences recognized because of investing and financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments or other \ncorporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties.\nIn addition, we believe that excluding charges related to stock compensation and unrealized gains or losses facilitates for \ninvestors a comparison of our business activities across periods without the volatility resulting from market forces outside of our control. \nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a measure of our performance. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our historical expenditures or \nfuture requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure of performance, \nit does not represent net income (loss) or cash flows from operations calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, and it should \nnot be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity.\nIn order to calculate the Adjusted EBITDA margin, we divide Adjusted EBITDA by total revenues as presented in our \nconsolidated statements of operations. We believe that this supplemental performance measure provides investors with additional \nuseful information regarding the profitability of our operating activities.\nWe are not able to forecast the net income of future periods without unreasonable effort and therefore do not provide a \nreconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA on a forward-looking basis. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and/or \namount of items that depend on market conditions outside of our control, including the timing of dispositions, capital events, and \nfinancing decisions, as well as quarterly components such as gain on sales of real estate, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate \ninvestments, impairments of real estate, impairments of non-real estate investments, and changes in provision for expected credit \nlosses on financial instruments.

Annual rental revenue \nper RSF is computed by dividing annual rental revenue by the sum of 100% of the RSF of our consolidated properties and our share of \nthe RSF of properties held in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. As of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, approximately \n91%\n of our leases (on \nan annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, \nutilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to \nbase rent. Annual rental revenue excludes these operating expenses recovered from our tenants. Amounts recovered from our tenants \nrelated to these operating expenses, along with base rent, are classified in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of \noperations.\nCapitalization rates\nCapitalization rates are calculated based on net operating income and net operating income (cash basis) annualized, \nexcluding lease termination fees, on stabilized operating assets for the quarter preceding the date on which the property is sold, or \nnear-term prospective net operating income.\nCapitalized interest\nWe capitalize interest cost as a cost of a project during periods for which activities necessary to develop, redevelop, or \nreposition a project for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has \nbeen incurred. Activities necessary to develop, redevelop, or reposition a project include pre-construction activities such as \nentitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building \nimprovements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective \ntenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of \nbuildings. If we cease activities necessary to prepare a project for its intended use, interest costs related to such project are expensed \nas incurred.\n120\nCash interest\nCash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP plus capitalized interest, less amortization of \nloan fees and debt premiums (discounts).\n Refer to “\nFixed-charge coverage ratio\n” in this section for a reconciliation of interest expense, \nthe most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to cash interest.\nClass A/A+ properties and AAA locations\nClass A/A+ properties are properties clustered in AAA locations that provide innovative tenants with highly dynamic and \ncollaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, \nefficiency, creativity, and success. These properties are typically well-located, professionally managed, and well-maintained, offering a \nwide range of amenities and featuring premium construction materials and finishes. Class A/A+ properties are generally newer or have \nundergone substantial redevelopment and are generally expected to command higher annual rental rates compared to other classes of \nsimilar properties. AAA locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related \nbusinesses. It is important to note that our definition of property classification may not be directly comparable to other equity REITs.\nCredit rating\nRepresents the credit ratings assigned by S&P Global Ratings or Moody’s Ratings as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n. A credit rating is \nnot a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time.\nDevelopment, redevelopment, and pre-construction\nA key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new \nClass A/A+ properties, as well as property enhancements identified during the underwriting of certain acquired properties. These efforts \nare primarily concentrated in collaborative Megacampus™ ecosystems within AAA life science innovation clusters, as well as other \nstrategic locations that support innovation and growth. These projects are generally focused on providing high-quality, generic, and \nreusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of a wide range of tenants. Upon completion, each development or \nredevelopment project is expected to generate increases in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development and \nredevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher \noccupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.\nDevelopment projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable laboratory facilities. \nRedevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of acquired office, warehouse, or shell space into laboratory space. \nWe generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new Class A/A+ laboratory space without \nfirst securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality Class A/A+ properties.\nPre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of\n \nconstruction of aboveground building improvements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time\n \nrequired to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and\n \nare required for the vertical construction of buildings. Ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to\n \ngenerate significant revenue and cash flows.\nDevelopment, redevelopment, and pre-construction spending also includes the following costs: (i) amounts to bring certain\n \nacquired properties up to market standard and/or other costs identified during the acquisition process (generally within two years of\n \nacquisition) and (ii) permanent conversion of space for highly flexible, move-in-ready laboratory space to foster the growth of promising\n \nearly- and growth-stage life science companies.\nRevenue-enhancing and repositioning capital expenditures represent spending to reposition or significantly change the use of \na property, including through improvement in the asset quality from Class B to Class A/A+.\nNon-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures represent costs required to maintain the current revenues of a stabilized \nproperty, including the associated costs for renewed and re-leased space.\nDividend payout ratio (common stock)\nDividend payout ratio (common stock) is the ratio of the absolute dollar amount of dividends on our common stock (shares of \ncommon stock outstanding on the respective record dates multiplied by the related dividend per share) to funds from operations \nattributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted, as adjusted.\nDividend yield\nDividend yield for the quarter represents the annualized quarter dividend divided by the closing common stock price at the end \nof the quarter.\n121\nFixed-charge coverage ratio\nFixed-charge coverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure representing the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to cash interest and \nfixed charges. We believe that this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy fixed financing \nobligations and preferred stock dividends. Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP plus \ncapitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts).\nThe following table reconciles interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in \naccordance with GAAP, to cash interest and computes fixed-charge coverage ratio\n for the \nthree and nine months ended September 30, \n2025\n and \n2024\n (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n532,502\n$\n554,908\n$\n1,617,450\n$\n1,660,551\nInterest expense\n$\n54,852\n$\n43,550\n$\n161,024\n$\n130,179\nCapitalized interest\n86,091\n86,496\n248,579\n249,375\nAmortization of loan fees\n(4,505)\n(4,222)\n(13,811)\n(12,510)\nAmortization of debt discounts\n(325)\n(330)\n(1,009)\n(976)\nCash interest and fixed charges\n$\n136,113\n$\n125,494\n$\n394,783\n$\n366,068\nFixed-charge coverage ratio:\n– quarter annualized\n3.9x\n4.4x\n4.1x\n4.5x\n– trailing 12 months\n4.1x\n4.5x\n4.1x\n4.5x\nWe are not able to forecast the net income of future periods without unreasonable effort and therefore do not provide a \nreconciliation for fixed-charge coverage ratio on a forward-looking basis. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing \nand/or amount of items that depend on market conditions outside of our control, including the timing of dispositions, capital events, and \nfinancing decisions, as well as quarterly components such as gain on sales of real estate, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate \ninvestments, impairments of real estate, impairments of non-real estate investments, and changes in provision for expected credit \nlosses on financial instruments. Our attempt to predict these amounts may produce significant but inaccurate estimates, which would be \npotentially misleading for our investors.\nGross assets\nGross assets are calculated as total assets plus accumulated depreciation\n as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n and \nDecember 31, 2024\n \n(in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nTotal assets\n$\n37,375,148\n$\n37,527,449\nAccumulated depreciation\n6,416,745\n5,625,179\nGross assets\n$\n43,791,893\n$\n43,152,628\n122\nIncremental annual net operating income on development and redevelopment projects\nIncremental annual net operating income represents the amount of net operating income, on an annual basis, expected to be \nrealized upon a project being placed into service and achieving full occupancy. Incremental annual net operating income is calculated \nas the initial stabilized yield multiplied by the project’s total cost at completion.\nInitial stabilized yield (unlevered)\nInitial stabilized yield is calculated as the estimated amounts of net operating income at stabilization divided by our investment \nin the property. For this calculation, we exclude any tenant-funded and tenant-built landlord improvements from our investment in the \nproperty. Our initial stabilized yield excludes the benefit of leverage. Our cash rents related to our development and redevelopment \nprojects are generally expected to increase over time due to contractual annual rent escalations. Our estimates for initial stabilized \nyields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the \nproject. We expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner if there are significant changes to the expected \nproject yields or costs.\n•\nInitial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the \nterm(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis, and any amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-\nfunded and tenant-built landlord improvements.\n•\nInitial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have \nelapsed and our total cash investment in the property.\nInvestment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants\nInvestment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represent tenants that are investment-grade rated or publicly traded \ncompanies with an average daily market capitalization greater than $10 billion for the twelve months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025\n, as \nreported by Bloomberg Professional Services. Credit ratings from Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings reflect credit ratings of the \ntenant’s parent entity, and there can be no assurance that a tenant’s parent entity will satisfy the tenant’s lease obligation upon such \ntenant’s default. We monitor the credit quality and related material changes of our tenants. Material changes that cause a tenant’s \nmarket capitalization to decrease below $10 billion, which are not immediately reflected in the twelve-month average, may result in their \nexclusion from this measure.\nInvestments in real estate\nThe following table presents our new Class A/A+ development and redevelopment pipeline, excluding properties held for sale, \nas a percentage of gross assets and as a percentage of annual rental revenue as of \nSeptember 30, 2025\n (dollars in thousands): \nPercentage of\nBook Value\nGross Assets\nAnnual Rental \nRevenue\nProjects under active construction and one \n100%\n pre-leased committed near-\nterm project expected to commence in the next year\n$\n3,724,801\n9%\n—%\nFuture development projects\n(1) \nand land parcels primarily located in \nMegacampuses\n4,871,463\n11\n1\n$\n8,596,264\n20%\n1%\n(1)\nIncludes projects with existing buildings that are generating or can generate operating cash flows.

We present the proportionate share of certain financial line items \nas follows: (i) for each real estate joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, which are controlled by us through \ncontractual rights or majority voting rights, but of which we own less than 100%, we apply the noncontrolling interest economic \nownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at the amount of such cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component \npresented; and (ii) for each real estate joint venture that we do not control and do not consolidate, which are instead controlled jointly or \nby our joint venture partners through contractual rights or majority voting rights, we apply our economic ownership percentage to each \nfinancial item to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented. \nThe components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures do not represent \nour legal claim to those items. For each entity that we do not wholly own, the joint venture agreement generally determines what equity \nholders can receive upon capital events, such as sales or refinancing, or in the event of a liquidation. Equity holders are normally \nentitled to their respective legal ownership of any residual cash from a joint venture only after all liabilities, priority distributions, and \nclaims have been repaid or satisfied.\nWe believe that this information can help investors estimate the balance sheet and operating results information related to our \npartially owned entities. Presenting this information provides a perspective not immediately available from consolidated financial \nstatements and one that can supplement an understanding of the joint venture assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in \nour consolidated results.\nThe components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures are limited as an \nanalytical tool as the overall economic ownership interest does not represent our legal claim to each of our joint ventures’ assets, \nliabilities, or results of operations. In addition, joint venture financial information may include financial information related to the \nunconsolidated real estate joint ventures that we do not control. We believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding \nof our operating results and our total assets and liabilities, joint venture financial information should be examined in conjunction with our \nconsolidated statements of operations and balance sheets. Joint venture financial information should not be considered an alternative \nto our consolidated financial statements, which are presented and prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n124\nMegacampus™\nA Megacampus ecosystem is a cluster campus that consists of approximately 1 million RSF or greater, including operating, \nactive development/redevelopment, and land RSF less operating RSF expected to be demolished.

We believe net operating \nincome provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects \nthose income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure \nfor investors to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated real estate assets. Net operating income on a cash basis is net \noperating income adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent, amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease revenue, \namortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded and tenant-built landlord improvements, and changes in the provision for \nexpected credit losses on financial instruments required by GAAP. We believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to \ninvestors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent revenue and the amortization of \nacquired above- and below-market leases and tenant-funded and tenant-built landlord improvements.\n126\nFurthermore, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure of our consolidated properties\n \nbecause, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs,\n \nwhich provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. Net operating income can be used to measure the initial\n \nstabilized yields of our properties by calculating net operating income generated by a property divided by our investment in the property.\n \nNet operating income excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to the\n \nresults of operations of our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real\n \nestate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization,\n \nbecause of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of operating performance at the property level.\n \nImpairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairments of real estate\n \nto be property-level operating expenses. Impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the\n \ncurrent operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. Our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in\n \nthe value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. These impairments result from investing decisions or a deterioration\n \nin market conditions. We also exclude realized and unrealized investment gain or loss, which results from investment decisions that\n \noccur at the corporate level related to non-real estate investments in publicly traded companies and certain privately held entities.\n \nTherefore, we do not consider these activities to be an indication of operating performance of our real estate assets at the property\n \nlevel. Our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as\n \nlosses on early extinguishment of debt and changes in provision for expected credit losses on financial instruments, as these charges\n \noften relate to corporate strategy. Property operating expenses included in determining net operating income primarily consist of costs\n \nthat are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases;\n \ncontracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries.\n \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional\n \nfees, rent, and supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. We calculate operating margin as net operating\n \nincome divided by total revenues.\nWe believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should \nbe examined in conjunction with net income or loss as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. Net operating income \nshould not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows \nas a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions.\nWe are not able to forecast the net income of future periods without unreasonable effort and therefore do not provide a \nreconciliation for net operating income on a forward-looking basis. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and/or \namount of items that depend on market conditions outside of our control, including the timing of dispositions, capital events, and \nfinancing decisions, as well as quarterly components such as gain on sales of real estate, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate \ninvestments, impairments of real estate, impairments of non-real estate investments, and changes in provision for expected credit \nlosses on financial instruments. Our attempt to predict these amounts may produce significant but inaccurate estimates, which would be \npotentially misleading for our investors.\nOperating statistics\nWe present certain operating statistics related to our properties, including number of properties, RSF, occupancy percentage, \nleasing activity, and contractual lease expirations as of the end of the period. We believe these measures are useful to investors \nbecause they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. We compute the number of properties, RSF, occupancy \npercentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations at 100%, excluding RSF at properties classified as held for sale, for all \nproperties in which we have an investment, including properties owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint \nventures.\n For operating metrics based on annual rental revenue, refer to “\nAnnual rental revenue\n” in this section.\nSame property comparisons\nAs a result of changes within our total property portfolio during the comparative periods presented, including changes from \nassets acquired or sold, properties placed into development or redevelopment, and development or redevelopment properties recently \nplaced into service, the consolidated total income from rentals, as well as rental operating expenses in our operating results, can show \nsignificant changes from period to period. In order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given quarterly or \nannual period, we analyze the operating performance for all consolidated properties that were fully operating for the entirety of the \ncomparative periods presented, referred to as same properties. We separately present quarterly and year-to-date same property results \nto align with the interim financial information required by the SEC in our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial \ncondition and results of operations. These same properties are analyzed separately from properties acquired subsequent to the first day \nin the earliest comparable quarterly or year-to-date period presented, properties that underwent development or redevelopment at any \ntime during the comparative periods, unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, properties classified as held for sale, and corporate \nentities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results. Additionally, \ntermination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of same properties.\n Refer to “\nSame properties\n” in Item 2 for additional information.\n127\nStabilized occupancy date\nThe stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which a development or redevelopment project is expected to \nreach occupancy of 95% or greater.\nTenant recoveries\nTenant recoveries represent revenues comprising reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and \nmaintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses and earned in the period during which the applicable expenses \nare incurred and the tenant’s obligation to reimburse us arises.\nWe classify rental revenues and tenant recoveries generated through the leasing of real estate assets within revenues in \nincome from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations.\n We provide investors with a separate presentation of rental revenues \nand tenant recoveries in “\nResults of operations\n” in Item 2 because we believe it promotes investors’ understanding of our operating \nresults. \nWe believe that the presentation of tenant recoveries is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to recover \noperating expenses under our triple net leases, including recoveries of utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes, \ncommon area expenses, and other operating expenses, and of our ability to mitigate the effect to net income for any significant \nvariability to components of our operating expenses.\nThe following table reconciles income from rentals to tenant recoveries for the \nthree and nine months ended September 30, \n2025\n and \n2024\n (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nIncome from rentals\n$\n735,849\n$\n775,744\n$\n2,216,303\n$\n2,286,457\nRental revenues\n(541,070)\n(579,569)\n(1,646,559)\n(1,737,804)\nTenant recoveries\n$\n194,779\n$\n196,175\n$\n569,744\n$\n548,653\nTotal equity capitalization\nTotal equity capitalization is equal to the outstanding shares of common stock multiplied by the closing price on the last trading \nday at the end of each period presented.\nTotal market capitalization\nTotal market capitalization is equal to the sum of total equity capitalization and total debt.\nUnencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income\n \nUnencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we \nbelieve is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets as it \nreflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. Unencumbered net operating income is \nderived from assets classified in continuing operations, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security \ninterest, as of the period for which income is presented.\nThe following table summarizes unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income for the \nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2025\n and \n2024\n (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nUnencumbered net operating income\n$\n512,710\n$\n553,589\n$\n1,579,167\n$\n1,644,687\nEncumbered net operating income\n—\n4,753\n2,913\n13,929\nTotal net operating income\n$\n512,710\n$\n558,342\n$\n1,582,080\n$\n1,658,616\nUnencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total \nnet operating income\n100.0%\n99.1%\n99.8%\n99.2%\n128\nWeighted-average shares of common stock outstanding – diluted\nFrom time to time, we enter into capital market transactions, including forward equity sales agreements (“Forward \nAgreements”), to fund acquisitions, to fund construction of our development and redevelopment projects, and for general working \ncapital purposes. While the Forward Agreements are outstanding, we are required to consider the potential dilutive effect of our Forward \nAgreements under the treasury stock method. Under this method, we also include the dilutive effect of unvested restricted stock awards \n(“RSAs”) with forfeitable dividends in the calculation of diluted shares. \nRefer to Note 13 – “Earnings per share” and Note 14 – \n“Stockholders’ equity” to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for additional information.\nThe weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding used in calculating EPS – diluted, funds from operations per \nshare – diluted, and funds from operations per share – diluted, as adjusted, for the \nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2025\n \nand \n2024\n are calculated as follows.
