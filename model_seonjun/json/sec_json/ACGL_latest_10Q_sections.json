We reported solid results for the 2025 third quarter, with an annualized net income return on average common equity and operating return on average common equity of 23.8% and 18.5%, respectively. See “\nComment on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n.” Meaningful contributions from all three segments along with solid investment returns pushed our year to date book value growth to 17.3%.\nWe continue to execute our cycle management strategy by actively allocating capital to the segments with the best risk-adjusted returns, while retaining the flexibility to invest in our platform when we find attractive opportunities. This approach, combined with a diversified global platform and strong distribution relationships, allows us to adapt dynamically to shifting market conditions. Our strong balance sheet and capital-generating capabilities, permit us to both invest in our business, and return capital to investors. During the 2025 third quarter, we repurchased $732 million of Arch shares in the quarter. \nAs competition in the overall property and casualty market is increasing, some sectors are seeing increased pressure while others continue to experience rate improvements. We continue to believe the property and casualty market presents meaningful opportunities,\n \nas we lean into the strength of our brand, including underwriting discipline, a longer term view of risk, and use risk-based pricing tools to generate profitable business.\nOur insurance segment reported $129 million of underwriting income for the 2025 third quarter, with net premium written nearly $2 billion, which is an increase of 7.3% from the 2024 third quarter. Growth in net premiums written primarily resulted from the U.S MidCorp and Entertainment Insurance businesses acquired from Allianz on August 1, 2024 (“MCE Acquisition”). The acquired business provides a significant platform from which we intend to build further scale in the middle market sector. We saw selective growth in our North American other liability occurrence business of 17%, supported by middle market and double-digit rate increases in E&S casualty.\nNet premiums written in our North American property and short-tail book increased 15%, where growth in middle market admitted property more than offset declines in E&S property. International premium volume remained stable, as the Lloyd’s and London market businesses are experiencing increased, but rational, competition. Our long-term investment in establishing a leadership position at Lloyd’s continues to yield strong results reflected in favorable signings and our ability to attract top-tier underwriting talent.\nOur reinsurance segment contributed $482 million of underwriting income in the 2025 third quarter. Net premiums written were $1.7 billion, down roughly 11% when compared to 2024 third quarter, reflecting current pricing conditions in short-tail and property catastrophe lines and increased retentions by cedants. We are growing selectively and focusing on areas where margins are attractive. We continue to like our prospects in most lines of business and, with improving conditions in casualty lines, our agility and ability to create opportunities is an advantage for us in this market. Our diversified reinsurance platform, supported by strong partnerships with our brokers and ceding companies across multiple lines and geographies, further enhances our ability to navigate a competitive environment. \nOur mortgage segment continued to deliver a steady level of earnings, generating $260 million of underwriting income in the 2025 third quarter. While new originations remained modest due to affordability challenges, underlying fundamentals remained strong and our U.S. market share was stable as industry pricing discipline held. The persistency of our in force U.S. primary mortgage insurance portfolio remained a healthy 82.3% and our delinquency rate remained low. We continue to expect the mortgage segment to serve as a steady diversifying contributor to our overall earnings and generate attractive underwriting income given the high credit quality and embedded equity of our in-force portfolio.\nARCH CAPITAL\n 39\n2025 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL MEASURES\nManagement uses the following three key financial indicators in evaluating our performance and measuring the overall growth in value generated for Arch Capital’s common shareholders:\nBook Value per Share\nBook value per share represents total common shareholders’ equity available to Arch divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Management uses growth in book value per share as a key measure of the value generated for our common shareholders each period and believes that book value per share is the key driver of Arch Capital’s share price over time. Book value per share is impacted by, among other factors, our underwriting results, investment returns and share repurchase activity, which has an accretive or dilutive impact on book value per share depending on the purchase price. Book value per share was $62.32 at September 30, 2025, compared to $59.17 at June 30, 2025, and $57.00 at September 30, 2024. The 5.3% increase in book value per share for the 2025 third quarter primarily reflected strong underwriting and investment returns.\nOperating Return on Average Common Equity\nOperating return on average common equity (“Operating ROAE”) represents annualized after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders divided by the average of beginning and ending common shareholders’ equity available to Arch during the period. After-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Regulation G, represents net income available to Arch common shareholders, excluding net realized gains or losses (which includes realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of equity securities and assets accounted for using the fair value option, realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, changes in the allowance for credit losses on financial assets and gains or losses realized from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries), equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses, transaction costs and other and income taxes. Management uses Operating ROAE as a key measure of the return generated to common shareholders. See \n“Comment on Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nOur annualized net income return on average common equity was 23.8% for the 2025 third quarter, compared to 19.0% for the 2024 third quarter, and 19.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 22.9% for the 2024 period. Our Operating ROAE was 18.5% for the 2025 third quarter, compared to 14.8% for the 2024 third quarter and 16.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 18.3% for the 2024 period. Returns for the 2025 periods reflected strong underwriting and investment returns.\nTotal Return on Investments\nTotal return on investments, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Regulation G, includes investment income, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net realized gains or losses attributable to the investment portfolio and the change in unrealized gains or losses generated by Arch’s investment portfolio. Total return is calculated on a pre-tax basis and before investment expenses and reflects the effect of financial market conditions along with foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, total return incorporates the timing of investment returns during the periods. The following table summarizes our total return compared to the benchmark return against which we measured our portfolio during the periods. See \n“Comment on Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nArch\nPortfolio\nBenchmark\nReturn\nPre-tax total return (before investment expenses):\n2025 Third Quarter\n1.80 \n%\n1.81 \n%\n2024 Third Quarter\n3.97 \n%\n4.24 \n%\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025\n7.07 \n%\n7.27 \n%\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\n6.20 \n%\n6.40 \n%\nTotal return for the 2025 periods reflected the effects of lower bond yields, a weaker U.S. dollar and equity market returns. The portfolio slightly underperformed their benchmark returns, primarily due to the sale of certain alternative investments accounted for using the equity method. The allocation of our portfolio remained neutral relative to our targeted benchmark. We continue to maintain a relatively short duration on our fixed income portfolio of 3.24 years at September 30, 2025, compared to 3.31 years at December 31, 2024. \nThe benchmark return index is a customized combination of indices intended to approximate a target portfolio by asset mix and average credit quality with a fixed income component matching the approximate estimated duration and currency mix of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities. It is recalibrated annually. Although the estimated fixed income duration and average credit quality of this index will move as the duration and rating of its constituent securities \nARCH CAPITAL\n 40\n2025 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nchange, generally we do not adjust the composition of the benchmark return index during the year except to incorporate changes to the mix of liability currencies and durations noted above. The benchmark return index should not be interpreted as expressing a preference for or aversion to any particular sector or sector weight. At September 30, 2025, the fixed income portion of the benchmark had an average credit quality of “A1” by Moody’s and an estimated fixed income duration of 3.18 years.\nThe benchmark return index included weightings to the following indices:\n%\nICE BofA 1-10 Year U.S. Corporate Index\n26.70 \nYield on 3-5 Year U.S. Treasury Index plus 6%\n17.00 \nICE BofA 1-10 Year U.S. Treasury Index\n15.00 \nICE BofA 0-3 Month U.S. Treasury Index\n3.00 \nJPM CLOIE Investment Grade\n6.00 \nICE BofA 1-5 Year U.K. Gilt Index\n5.25 \nICE BofA U.S. High Yield Constrained Index\n5.00 \nICE BofA U.S. ABS & CMBS Index\n4.70 \nS&P 500 Total Return Index\n4.50 \nICE BofA 3-5 Year US Agency CMO Excluding IO & PO Index\n3.50 \nICE BofA German Government 1-5 Year Index\n3.25 \nICE BofA German Government 5-7 Year Index\n0.60 \nICE BofA 1-5 Year Canada Government Index\n2.60 \nICE BofA 15+ Year Canada Government Index\n0.30 \nICE BofA 1-5 Year Australia Government Index\n1.90 \nICE BofA 5-10 Year Australia Government Index\n0.45 \nICE BofA 1-5 Year Japan Government Index\n0.25 \nTotal\n100.00 \n%\nCOMMENT ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThroughout this filing, we present our operations in the way we believe will be the most meaningful and useful to investors, analysts, rating agencies and others who use our financial information in evaluating the performance of our company. This presentation includes the use of after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders, which is defined as net income available to Arch common shareholders, excluding net realized gains or losses (which includes realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of equity securities and assets accounted for using the fair value option, realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, changes in the allowance for credit losses on financial assets and gains or losses realized from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries), equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses, transaction costs and other, income taxes, and the use of annualized operating return on average common equity. The presentation of after-tax operating income available to Arch \ncommon shareholders and annualized operating return on average common equity are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measures to net income available to Arch common shareholders and annualized net income return on average common equity (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures) in accordance with Regulation G is included under “Results of Operations” below.\nWe believe that net realized gains or losses, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses and transaction costs and other in any particular period are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, our business. Although net realized gains or losses, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method and net foreign exchange gains or losses are an integral part of our operations, the decision to realize these items, are independent of the insurance underwriting process and result, in large part, from general economic and financial market conditions. Furthermore, certain users of our financial information believe that, for many companies, the timing of the realization of investment gains or losses is largely opportunistic. In addition, changes in the allowance for credit losses and net impairment losses recognized in earnings on our investments represent other-than-temporary declines in expected recovery values on securities without actual realization. Furthermore, we exclude net realized gains or losses from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries, due to their non-recurring nature, such items are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, our business performance. \nThe use of the equity method on certain of our investments funds that invest in fixed maturity securities is driven by the ownership structure of such funds (either limited partnerships or limited liability companies). In applying the equity method, these investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted based on our proportionate share of the net income or loss of the funds (which include changes in the market value of the underlying securities in the funds). This method of accounting is different from the way in which we account for our other investments; and, the timing of the recognition of equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method may differ from gains or losses in the future upon sale or maturity of such investments. \nTransaction costs and other include integration, advisory, financing, legal, severance, incentive compensation and all other transaction costs directly related to acquisitions. We believe that transaction costs and other, due to their nonrecurring nature, are not indicative of the performance of, or trends in, our business performance.\nARCH CAPITAL\n 41\n2025 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that showing net income available to Arch common shareholders exclusive of the items referred to above reflects the underlying fundamentals of our business since we evaluate the performance of and manage our business to produce an underwriting profit. In addition to presenting the net income available to Arch common shareholders, we believe that this presentation enables investors and other users of our financial information to analyze our performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. We also believe that this measure follows industry practice and, therefore, allows the users of financial information to compare our performance with our industry peer group. We believe that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies that follow us and the insurance industry as a whole generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons.\nOur segment information includes the presentation of consolidated underwriting income or loss. Such measures represent the pre-tax profitability of our underwriting operations and include net premiums earned plus other underwriting income, less losses and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition expenses and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses include those operating expenses that are incremental and/or directly attributable to our individual underwriting operations. Underwriting income or loss does not incorporate certain income and expense items which are included in corporate. While these measures are presented in \nnote 5, “Segment Information,”\n to our consolidated financial statements, they are considered non-GAAP financial measures when presented elsewhere on a consolidated basis. The reconciliations of underwriting income or loss to income before income taxes (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis, in accordance with Regulation G, is shown in \nnote 5, “Segment Information”\n to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe measure segment performance for our three underwriting segments based on underwriting income or loss. We do not manage our assets by underwriting segment, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, and, accordingly, investment income, income from operating affiliates and other non-underwriting related items are not allocated to each underwriting segment.\nOur presentation of segment information includes the use of a current year loss ratio which excludes favorable or adverse development in prior year loss reserves. This ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of such measure to the loss ratio (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) in accordance with Regulation G is shown on the individual segment pages. Management utilizes the current year loss ratio in its analysis of the underwriting performance of each of our underwriting segments. Effective in the 2025 first quarter, the ‘Other operating expense ratio’ includes ‘Other underwriting income.’\nTotal return on investments includes investment income, equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, net realized gains or losses (excluding changes in the allowance for credit losses on non-investment related financial assets) and the change in unrealized gains or losses generated by Arch’s investment portfolio. Total return is calculated on a pre-tax basis and before investment expenses, and reflects the effect of financial market conditions along with foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, total return incorporates the timing of investment returns during the periods. There is no directly comparable GAAP financial measure for total return. Management uses total return on investments as a key measure of the return generated to Arch common shareholders on the capital held in the business, and compares the return generated by our investment portfolio against benchmark returns which we measured our portfolio against during the periods.\nARCH CAPITAL\n 42\n2025 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial data, including a reconciliation of net income or loss available to Arch common shareholders to after-tax operating income or loss available to Arch common shareholders.

Our insurance, reinsurance and mortgage segments each have managers who are responsible for the overall profitability of their respective segments and who are directly accountable to our chief operating decision makers. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer are the Company’s chief operating decision makers. They do not assess performance, measure return on equity or make resource allocation decisions on a line of business basis. Management measures segment performance for our three underwriting segments based on underwriting income or loss. We do not manage our assets by underwriting segment, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, and accordingly, investment income is not allocated to each underwriting segment.\nWe determined our reportable segments using the management approach described in accounting guidance regarding disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those used for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Intersegment business is allocated to the segment accountable for the underwriting results. \nInsurance Segment\nThe Company’s insurance segment primarily consists of commercial insurance lines of business, with a focus on specialty insurance products. These products are mainly offered in North America, Bermuda, the United Kingdom, continental Europe and Australia. Products offered in North America include: commercial automobile; commercial multi-peril; other liability-claims made, which includes financial and professional lines; other liability-occurrence, which includes admitted and excess and surplus casualty lines; property and short-tail specialty; workers compensation; and other. Products offered across the Company’s International units include: property and short-tail specialty; and casualty and other.\nARCH CAPITAL\n 43\n2025 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables set forth our insurance segment’s underwriting results:\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n% Change\nGross premiums written\n$\n2,567 \n$\n2,341 \n9.7 \nPremiums ceded\n(614)\n(521)\nNet premiums written\n1,953 \n1,820 \n7.3 \nChange in unearned premiums\n16 \n(55)\nNet premiums earned\n1,969 \n1,765 \n11.6 \nOther underwriting income (1)\n9 \n— \n \nLosses and loss adjustment expenses\n(1,162)\n(1,087)\nAcquisition expenses\n(386)\n(308)\nOther operating expenses\n(301)\n(250)\nUnderwriting income (loss)\n$\n129 \n$\n120 \n7.5 \nUnderwriting Ratios\n \n \n% Point\nChange\nLoss ratio\n59.0 \n%\n61.6 \n%\n(2.6)\nAcquisition expense ratio\n19.6 \n%\n17.4 \n%\n2.2 \nOther operating expense ratio (2)\n14.8 \n%\n14.1 \n%\n0.7 \nCombined ratio\n93.4 \n%\n93.1 \n%\n0.3 \n(1)    ‘Other underwriting income’ includes revenue earned from underwriting-related activities covered under existing service contracts.\n(2)    The ‘Other operating expense ratio’ for the 2025 period includes ‘Other underwriting income.’ See ‘Comments on Non-GAAP Financial Measures’ for further details.\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n% Change\nGross premiums written\n$\n7,893 \n$\n6,569 \n20.2 \nPremiums ceded\n(1,971)\n(1,649)\nNet premiums written\n5,922 \n4,920 \n20.4 \nChange in unearned premiums\n(124)\n(226)\nNet premiums earned\n5,798 \n4,694 \n23.5 \nOther underwriting income (1)\n25 \n— \nLosses and loss adjustment expenses\n(3,568)\n(2,789)\nAcquisition expenses\n(1,116)\n(872)\nOther operating expenses\n(883)\n(718)\nUnderwriting income (loss)\n$\n256 \n$\n315 \n(18.7)\nUnderwriting Ratios\n \n \n% Point\nChange\nLoss ratio\n61.5 \n%\n59.4 \n%\n2.1 \nAcquisition expense ratio\n19.3 \n%\n18.6 \n%\n0.7 \nOther operating expense ratio (2)\n14.8 \n%\n15.3 \n%\n(0.5)\nCombined ratio\n95.6 \n%\n93.3 \n%\n2.3 \n(1)    ‘Other underwriting income’ includes revenue earned from underwriting-related activities covered under existing service contracts.\n(2)    The ‘Other operating expense ratio’ for the 2025 period includes ‘Other underwriting income.’ See ‘Comments on Non-GAAP Financial Measures’ for further details.\nPremiums Written\n.\nThe following tables set forth our insurance segment’s net premiums written by major line of business:\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n \nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nNorth America\nProperty and short-tail specialty\n$\n339 \n17.4 \n$\n296 \n16.3 \nOther liability - occurrence\n297 \n15.2 \n253 \n13.9 \nOther liability - claims made\n209 \n10.7 \n228 \n12.5 \nCommercial multi-peril\n194 \n9.9 \n163 \n9.0 \nWorkers compensation\n151 \n7.7 \n147 \n8.1 \nCommercial automobile\n150 \n7.7 \n134 \n7.4 \nOther\n86 \n4.4 \n81 \n4.5 \nTotal North America \n1,426 \n73.0 \n1,302 \n71.5 \nInternational\nProperty and short-tail specialty\n$\n287 \n14.7 \n$\n287 \n15.8 \nCasualty and other\n240 \n12.3 \n231 \n12.7 \nTotal International \n527 \n27.0 \n518 \n28.5 \nTotal\n$\n1,953 \n100.0 \n$\n1,820 \n100.0 \n2025 Third Quarter versus 2024 Period. \nGross premiums written by the insurance segment in the 2025 third quarter were 9.7% higher than in the 2024 third quarter, while net premiums written were 7.3% higher than in the 2024 third quarter.

The persistency rate represents the percentage of mortgage insurance in force at the beginning of a 12 month period that remains in force at the end of such period.\nThe following tables provide details on the new insurance written (“NIW”) generated by Arch MI U.S. NIW represents the original principal balance of all loans that received coverage during the period.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nTotal new insurance written (NIW)\n$\n12,965 \n$\n13,526 \nCredit quality:\n>=740\n$\n9,850 \n76.0 \n$\n9,438 \n69.8 \n680-739\n2,753 \n21.2 \n3,584 \n26.5 \n620-679\n359 \n2.8 \n502 \n3.7 \n<620\n3 \n0.0 \n2 \n0.0 \nTotal\n$\n12,965 \n100.0 \n$\n13,526 \n100.0 \nLoan-to-value (LTV):\n95.01% and above\n$\n1,038 \n8.0 \n$\n1,089 \n8.1 \n90.01% to 95.00%\n5,668 \n43.7 \n6,620 \n48.9 \n85.01% to 90.00%\n4,323 \n33.3 \n4,293 \n31.7 \n85.00% and below\n1,936 \n14.9 \n1,524 \n11.3 \nTotal\n$\n12,965 \n100.0 \n$\n13,526 \n100.0 \nMonthly vs. single:\nMonthly\n$\n12,267 \n94.6 \n$\n12,581 \n93.0 \nSingle\n698 \n5.4 \n945 \n7.0 \nTotal\n$\n12,965 \n100.0 \n$\n13,526 \n100.0 \nPurchase vs. refinance:\nPurchase\n$\n12,319 \n95.0 \n$\n13,177 \n97.4 \nRefinance\n646 \n5.0 \n349 \n2.6 \nTotal\n$\n12,965 \n100.0 \n$\n13,526 \n100.0 \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nTotal new insurance written (NIW)\n$\n34,409 \n$\n36,661 \nCredit quality:\n>=740\n$\n26,096 \n75.8 \n$\n25,528 \n69.6 \n680-739\n7,383 \n21.5 \n9,885 \n27.0 \n620-679\n921 \n2.7 \n1,243 \n3.4 \n<620\n9 \n0.0 \n5 \n0.0 \nTotal\n$\n34,409 \n100.0 \n$\n36,661 \n100.0 \nLoan-to-value (LTV):\n95.01% and above\n$\n2,608 \n7.6 \n$\n2,645 \n7.2 \n90.01% to 95.00%\n15,674 \n45.6 \n19,094 \n52.1 \n85.01% to 90.00%\n11,188 \n32.5 \n10,964 \n29.9 \n85.01% and below\n4,939 \n14.4 \n3,958 \n10.8 \nTotal\n$\n34,409 \n100.0 \n$\n36,661 \n100.0 \nMonthly vs. single:\nMonthly\n$\n32,543 \n94.6 \n$\n34,261 \n93.5 \nSingle\n1,866 \n5.4 \n2,400 \n6.5 \nTotal\n$\n34,409 \n100.0 \n$\n36,661 \n100.0 \nPurchase vs. refinance:\nPurchase\n$\n32,747 \n95.2 \n$\n35,932 \n98.0 \nRefinance\n1,662 \n4.8 \n729 \n2.0 \nTotal\n$\n34,409 \n100.0 \n$\n36,661 \n100.0 \nARCH CAPITAL\n 49\n2025 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nNet Premiums Earned\n.\nThe following tables set forth our mortgage segment’s net premiums earned by major line of business:\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n \nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nU.S. primary mortgage insurance \n$\n204 \n67.8 \n$\n215 \n68.7 \nU.S. credit risk transfer (CRT) and other\n55 \n18.3 \n55 \n17.6 \nInternational mortgage insurance/\nreinsurance\n42 \n14.0 \n43 \n13.7 \nTotal\n$\n301 \n100.0 \n$\n313 \n100.0 \n2025 Third Quarter versus 2024 Period. \nNet premiums earned for the 2025 third quarter were 3.8% lower than in the 2024 third quarter, reflecting changes in net premiums written over the previous five quarters.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net premiums earned were 4.6% lower than in the 2024 period. The decrease in net premiums earned in the 2025 period primarily reflected a one-time expense related to the tender offer of certain Bellemeade Re mortgage insurance linked notes and a lower level of U.S. monthly premium volume.\nOther Underwriting Income\n.\nOther underwriting income, which is primarily related to GSE credit risk-sharing transactions, was $3 million for the 2025 third quarter, consistent with $3 million for the 2024 third quarter, and $17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $15 million for the 2024 period.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\n.\nThe table below shows the components of the mortgage segment’s loss ratio:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nCurrent year\n17.6 \n%\n20.1 \n%\n20.2 \n%\n19.9 \n%\nPrior period reserve development\n(18.1)\n%\n(20.5)\n%\n(20.4)\n%\n(23.9)\n%\nLoss ratio\n(0.5)\n%\n(0.4)\n%\n(0.2)\n%\n(4.0)\n%\nCurrent Year Loss Ratio\n.\n2025 Third Quarter versus 2024 Period. \nThe mortgage segment’s current year loss ratio was 2.5 points lower in the 2025 third quarter than in the 2024 third quarter. The lower current year loss ratio for the 2025 third quarter reflected a decline in new notices of default. \nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 versus 2024 Period\n. The mortgage segment’s current year loss ratio was 0.3 points higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 than for the 2024 period. The higher current year loss ratio for the 2025 period reflected slightly higher new delinquencies and the impact of the Bellemeade Re tender offers noted above. \nPrior Period Reserve Development\n.\nThe mortgage segment’s net favorable development was $54 million, or 18.1 points, for the 2025 third quarter, compared to $64 million, or 20.5 points, for the 2024 third quarter, and $179 million, or 20.4 points, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $220 million, or 23.9 points, for the 2024 period. See \nnote 6, “Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses,”\n to our consolidated financial statements for information about the mortgage segment’s prior year reserve development.\nUnderwriting Expenses\n.\n2025 Third Quarter versus 2024 Period. \nThe underwriting expense ratio for the mortgage segment was 14.0% in the 2025 third quarter, compared to 15.2% in the 2024 third quarter. \nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 versus 2024 period\n. The underwriting expense ratio for the mortgage segment was 15.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 16.2% for the 2024 period. \nARCH CAPITAL\n 50\n2025 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nCorporate\nThe Company’s corporate results include net investment income, net realized gains or losses (which includes realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of equity securities and assets accounted for using the fair value option, realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, changes in the allowance for credit losses on financial assets and gains or losses realized from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries), equity in net income or loss of investments accounted for using the equity method, other income or loss, corporate expenses, transaction costs and other, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, net foreign exchange gains or losses, income taxes, income from operating affiliates and items related to our non-cumulative preferred shares. \nNet Investment Income.\nThe components of net investment income were derived from the following sources:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nFixed maturities\n$\n379 \n$\n340 \n$\n1,081 \n$\n926 \nShort-term investments\n25 \n38 \n75 \n102 \nEquity securities (dividends)\n10 \n9 \n31 \n27 \nOther (1)\n19 \n35 \n82 \n103 \nGross investment income\n433 \n422 \n1,269 \n1,158 \nInvestment expenses (2)\n(25)\n(23)\n(78)\n(68)\nNet investment income\n$\n408 \n$\n399 \n$\n1,191 \n1,090 \n(1)    Amounts include dividends and other distributions on investment funds, term loan investments, funds held balances, cash balances and other items.\n(2)        Investment expenses were approximately 0.25% of average invested assets for the 2025 third quarter, compared to 0.29% for the 2024 third quarter, and 0.27% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, consistent with 0.27% for the 2024 period.\nThe higher level of net investment income for the 2025 periods primarily reflected growth in average invested assets, due in part to strong operating cash flows. Net cash flow from operating activities contributed $4.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The pre-tax investment income yield, calculated based on amortized cost and on an annualized basis, was 4.07% for the 2025 third quarter, compared to 4.40% for the 2024 third quarter, and 4.16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 4.29% for the 2024 period.\nCorporate Expenses.\nCorporate expenses were $28 million for the 2025 third quarter, compared to $19 million for the 2024 third quarter, and $107 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $88 million for the 2024 period. Such amounts primarily represent certain holding company costs necessary to support our worldwide operations and costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs.\nTransaction Costs and Other.\nTransaction costs and other for the 2025 third quarter was $21 million, compared to $30 million for the 2024 third quarter, and $49 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $55 million for the 2024 period. Amounts in both periods primarily includes direct costs related to the MCE Acquisition.\nOther Income or Losses.\nOther income for the 2025 third quarter was $22 million, compared to $8 million for the 2024 third quarter, and $38 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $30 million for the 2024 period. Amounts in both periods primarily reflect changes in the cash surrender value of our investment in corporate-owned life insurance.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets.\nAmortization of intangible assets for the 2025 third quarter was $49 million, compared to $88 million for the 2024 third quarter, and $146 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $136 million for the 2024 period. Amounts in both periods primarily related to the MCE Acquisition.\nInterest Expense.\nInterest expense was $37 million for the 2025 third quarter, compared to $35 million for the 2024 third quarter, and $110 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $104 million for the 2024 period. Interest expense primarily reflects amounts related to our outstanding senior notes.\nARCH CAPITAL\n 51\n2025 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nNet Realized Gains or Losses.\nNet realized gains for the 2025 third quarter were $210 million, compared to net realized gains of $169 million for the 2024 third quarter. Net realized gains were $442 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to net realized gains of $358 million for the 2024 period. Amounts in both periods reflected sales of investments as well as the impact of financial market movements on the Company’s equity securities and investments accounted for under the fair value option method. Amounts in the 2025 periods also include losses related to the sale of certain alternative investments accounted for under the equity method. Currently, our portfolio is actively managed to maximize total return within certain guidelines. The effect of financial market movements on the investment portfolio will directly impact net realized gains or losses as the portfolio is adjusted and rebalanced. Net realized gains or losses from the sale of fixed maturities primarily results from our decisions to reduce credit exposure, to change duration targets, to rebalance our portfolios or due to relative value determinations.\nNet realized gains or losses also include realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of equity securities and assets accounted for using the fair value option, realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, changes in the allowance for credit losses on financial assets and gains or losses realized from the acquisition or disposition of subsidiaries See \nnote 8, “Investment Information—Net Realized Gains (Losses)”\n and \nnote 8, “Investment Information—Allowance for Expected Credit Losses,”\n to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nEquity in Net Income or Losses of Investments Accounted for Using the Equity Method.\nEquity in net income of investments accounted for using the equity method was $134 million in the 2025 third quarter, compared to $171 million for the 2024 third quarter, and $349 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $437 million for the 2024 period. Such investments are generally recorded on a one to three month lag based on the availability of reports from the investment funds. Investment funds accounted for using the equity method totaled $6.2 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2024. See \nnote 8, “Investment Information—Investments Accounted For Using the Equity Method,”\n to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nNet Foreign Exchange Gains or Losses.\nNet foreign exchange losses for the 2025 third quarter were $7 million, compared to losses of $63 million for the 2024 third quarter. Net foreign exchange losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were $122 million, compared to losses of $31 million for the 2024 period. Amounts in both periods were primarily unrealized and resulted from the effects of revaluing our net insurance liabilities required to be settled in foreign currencies at each balance sheet date. \nIncome Tax Expense.\nOur income tax provision on income or loss before income taxes, including income or loss from operating affiliates, resulted in an expense of 13.7% for the 2025 third quarter, compared to an expense of 9.0% for the 2024 third quarter, and an expense of 14.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to an expense of 8.1% for the 2024 period. The increase in the 2025 period is primarily attributed to the Government of Bermuda enacting the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023, which established a 15% corporate income tax effective January 1, 2025. See \nnote 14, “Income Taxes”\n to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nIncome or Losses from Operating Affiliates.\nIncome from operating affiliates for the 2025 third quarter was $62 million, compared to income of $36 million for the 2024 third quarter, and income of $119 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to income of $136 million for the 2024 period. Such amounts primarily related to the Company’s investment in Somers Group Holdings Ltd. (“Somers”) and Coface SA. The decrease in income from operating affiliates for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily driven by lower level of affiliated income from Somers, partly due to the impact of California wildfires.

For the respective coverage periods, we will retain the first layer of the respective aggregate losses and the special purpose reinsurance companies will provide second layer coverage up to the outstanding coverage amount. We will then retain losses in excess of the outstanding coverage limit. The aggregate excess of loss reinsurance coverage generally decreases over a ten-year period as the underlying covered mortgages amortize, unless provisional call options embedded within certain of the Bellemeade Agreements are executed or if pre-defined delinquency triggering events occur.\nARCH CAPITAL\n 54\n2025 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the respective coverages and retentions at September 30, 2025:\nBellemeade Entities\n(Issue Date)\nInitial Coverage at Issuance\nCurrent Coverage\nRemaining Retention, Net\n2021-3 Ltd.

flows to meet the short-term and long-term cash requirements of our business operations.\nArch Capital is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of the shares in its subsidiaries. Generally, Arch Capital depends on its available cash resources, liquid investments and dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries to make payments, including the payment of debt service obligations and operating expenses it may incur and any dividends or liquidation amounts with respect to our preferred and common shares. \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Arch Capital received dividends of $1.2 billion from Arch Reinsurance Ltd. (“Arch Re Bermuda”), our Bermuda based reinsurer and insurer, which can pay approximately $4.0 billion to Arch Capital during the remainder of 2025 without providing an affidavit to the Bermuda Monetary Authority.\nWe expect that our liquidity needs, including our anticipated (re)insurance obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs, for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter, will be met by funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income, as well as by our balance of cash, short-term investments, proceeds on the sale or maturity of our investments, and our credit facilities.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nTotal cash provided by (used for):\n \n \nOperating activities\n$\n4,768 \n$\n5,100 \nInvesting activities\n(3,619)\n(4,881)\nFinancing activities\n(1,112)\n(35)\nEffects of exchange rate changes on foreign currency cash and restricted cash\n57 \n30 \nIncrease (decrease) in cash and restricted cash\n$\n94 \n$\n214 \nCash provided by operating activities\n for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was lower than in the 2024 period. Activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily reflected a higher level of losses paid than in the 2024 period.\n \nCash used for investing activities\n for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was lower than in the 2024 period. Activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 reflected lower net purchases of investments than in the 2024 period, due in part to a higher level of repurchases under our share repurchase program and a higher level of losses paid than in the 2024 period.\nCash used for financing activities\n for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was higher than in the 2024 period, primarily due to the higher level of repurchases under our share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of our common shares in the 2025 period, compared to nil in the 2024 period.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table provides an analysis of our capital structure:\nSeptember 30,\n2025\nDecember 31,\n2024\nSenior notes\n$\n2,728 \n$\n2,728 \nShareholders’ equity available to Arch:\nSeries F non-cumulative preferred shares\n$\n330 \n$\n330 \nSeries G non-cumulative preferred shares\n500 \n500 \nCommon shareholders’ equity\n22,889 \n19,990 \nTotal\n$\n23,719 \n$\n20,820 \nTotal capital available to Arch\n$\n26,447 \n$\n23,548 \nDebt to total capital (%)\n10.3 \n11.6 \nPreferred to total capital (%)\n3.1 \n3.5 \nDebt and preferred to total capital (%)\n13.5 \n15.1 \nArch MI U.S. is required to maintain compliance with the GSEs requirements, known as the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements or “PMIERs.” The financial requirements require an eligible mortgage insurer’s available assets, which generally include only the most liquid assets of an insurer, to meet or exceed “minimum required assets” as of each quarter end. Minimum required assets are calculated from PMIERs tables with several risk dimensions (including origination year, original loan-to-value and original credit score of performing loans, and the delinquency status of non-performing loans) and are subject to a minimum amount. Arch MI U.S. satisfied the PMIERs’ financial requirements with an estimated PMIER sufficiency ratio of 176% at September 30, 2025, compared to 186% at December 31, 2024. On August 21, 2024, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac each updated their PMIERs to incorporate new deductions to available assets for investment risk.

Natural catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather, fires, droughts and other natural disasters. Man-made catastrophic events may include acts of war, acts of terrorism and political instability. Catastrophes can also cause losses in non-property business such as mortgage insurance, workers’ compensation or general liability. In addition to the nature of property business, we believe that economic and geographic trends affecting insured property, including inflation, property value appreciation and geographic concentration, tend to generally increase the size of losses from catastrophic events over time.\nOur models employ both proprietary and vendor-based systems and include cross-line correlations for property, marine, offshore energy, aviation, workers compensation and personal accident. We seek to limit the probable maximum pre-tax loss to a specific level for severe catastrophic events. Currently, we seek to limit our 1-in-250 year return period net probable maximum loss from a severe catastrophic event in any geographic zone to approximately 25% of tangible shareholders’ equity available to Arch (total shareholders’ equity available to Arch less goodwill and intangible assets). We reserve the right to change this threshold at any time. \nBased on in-force exposure estimated as of October 1, 2025, our modeled peak zone catastrophe exposure was a windstorm affecting the Florida Tri-County regions, with a net probable maximum pre-tax loss of $1.9 billion, or 8.4% of tangible shareholders’ equity available to Arch, followed by windstorms affecting the Northeastern U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico regions with net probable maximum pre-tax losses of $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. Our exposures to other perils, such as U.S. earthquake and international events, were less than the exposures arising from U.S. windstorms and hurricanes. As of October 1, 2025, our modeled peak zone earthquake exposure (San Francisco earthquake) represented approximately 60% of our peak zone catastrophe exposure, and our modeled peak zone international exposure (Germany windstorm) was substantially less than both our peak zone windstorm and earthquake exposures.\nWe also have significant exposure to losses due to mortgage defaults resulting from severe economic events in the future. For our U.S. mortgage insurance business, we have developed a proprietary risk model (“Realistic Disaster Scenario” or “RDS”) that simulates the maximum loss resulting from a severe economic downturn impacting the housing market. The RDS models the collective impact of \nadverse conditions for key economic indicators, the most significant of which is a decline in home prices. The RDS model projects paths of future home prices, unemployment rates, income levels and interest rates and assumes correlation across states and geographic regions. The resulting future performance of our in-force portfolio is then estimated under the economic stress scenario, reflecting loan and borrower information.\nCurrently, we seek to limit our modeled RDS loss from a severe economic event to approximately 25% of tangible shareholders’ equity available to Arch. We reserve the right to change this threshold at any time. Based on in-force exposure estimated as of October 1, 2025, our modeled RDS loss was approximately $0.9 billion, or 4.0% of tangible shareholders’ equity available to Arch.\nNet probable maximum loss estimates are net of expected reinsurance recoveries, before income tax and before excess reinsurance reinstatement premiums. RDS loss estimates are net of expected reinsurance recoveries and before income tax. Catastrophe loss estimates are reflective of the zone indicated and not the entire portfolio. Since hurricanes and windstorms can affect more than one zone and make multiple landfalls, our catastrophe loss estimates include clash estimates from other zones. Our catastrophe loss estimates and RDS loss estimates do not represent our maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates. There can be no assurances that we will not suffer pre-tax losses greater than 25% of our tangible shareholders’ equity from one or more catastrophic events or severe economic events due to several factors. These factors include the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such events and the margin of error in making such determinations resulting from potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers, the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques or as a result of a decision to change the percentage of shareholders' equity exposed to a single catastrophic event or severe economic event. In addition, actual losses may increase if our reinsurers fail to meet their obligations to us or the reinsurance protections purchased by us are exhausted or are otherwise unavailable. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Catastrophic Events and Severe Economic Events” in our 2024 Form 10-K.\nARCH CAPITAL\n 60\n2025 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nMARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nIn accordance with the SEC’s Financial Reporting Release No. 48, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings, fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments as of September 30, 2025. Market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument and is comprised of several components, including liquidity, basis and price risks.\nAn analysis of material changes in market risk exposures at September 30, 2025 that affect the quantitative and qualitative disclosures presented in our 2024 Form 10-K (see section captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Market Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management”) were as follows: \nInvestment Market Risk\nFixed Income Securities. \nWe invest in interest rate sensitive securities, which are primarily debt securities. We consider the effect of interest rate movements on the fair value of our fixed maturities, short-term investments and certain of our other investments, equity securities and investments accounted for using the equity method which invest in fixed income securities (collectively, “Fixed Income Securities”) and the corresponding change in unrealized appreciation. As interest rates rise, the fair value of our Fixed Income Securities falls, and the converse is also true. Based on historical observations, there is a low probability that all interest rate yield curves would shift in the same direction at the same time. Furthermore, at times interest rate movements in certain credit sectors exhibit a much lower correlation to changes in U.S. Treasury yields. Accordingly, the actual effect of interest rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth in the following tables. \nThe following table summarizes the effect that an immediate, parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would have had on our Fixed Income Securities:\n(U.S. dollars in \nbillions)\nInterest Rate Shift in Basis Points\n-100\n-50\n—\n+50\n+100\nSeptember 30, 2025\n \n \n \n \nTotal fair value\n$\n45.2 \n$\n44.6 \n$\n44.0 \n$\n43.4 \n$\n42.8 \nChange from base\n2.8 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n(1.4)\n%\n(2.8)\n%\nChange in unrealized value\n$\n1.2 \n$\n0.6 \n$\n(0.6)\n$\n(1.2)\nDecember 31, 2024\nTotal fair value\n$\n40.0 \n$\n39.5 \n$\n38.9 \n$\n38.4 \n$\n37.9 \nChange from base\n2.8 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n(1.4)\n%\n(2.7)\n%\nChange in unrealized value\n$\n1.1 \n$\n0.5 \n$\n(0.5)\n$\n(1.1)\nIn addition, we consider the effect of credit spread movements on the market value of our Fixed Income Securities and the corresponding change in unrealized value. As credit spreads widen, the fair value of our Fixed Income Securities falls, and the converse is also true. In periods where the spreads on our Fixed Income Securities are much higher than their historical average due to short-term market dislocations, a parallel shift in credit spread levels would result in a much more pronounced change in unrealized value. \nThe following table summarizes the effect that an immediate, parallel shift in credit spreads in a static interest rate environment would have had on our Fixed Income Securities:\n(U.S. dollars in \nbillions)\nCredit Spread Shift in Percentage Points\n-100\n-50\n—\n+50\n+100\nSeptember 30, 2025\nTotal fair value\n$\n45.2 \n$\n44.6 \n$\n44.0 \n$\n43.4 \n$\n42.8 \nChange from base\n2.7 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n(1.4)\n%\n(2.7)\n%\nChange in unrealized value\n$\n1.2 \n$\n0.6 \n$\n(0.6)\n$\n(1.2)\nDecember 31, 2024\nTotal fair value\n$\n40.0 \n$\n39.5 \n$\n38.9 \n$\n38.4 \n$\n37.8 \nChange from base\n2.8 \n%\n1.4 \n%\n(1.4)\n%\n(2.8)\n%\nChange in unrealized value\n$\n1.1 \n$\n0.5 \n$\n(0.5)\n$\n(1.1)\nAnother method that attempts to measure portfolio risk is Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). VaR measures the worst expected loss under normal market conditions over a specific time interval at a given confidence level. The 1-year 95th percentile parametric VaR reported herein estimates that 95% of the time, the portfolio loss in a one-year horizon would be less than or equal to the calculated number, stated as a percentage of the measured portfolio’s initial value. The VaR is a variance-covariance based estimate, based on linear sensitivities of a portfolio to a broad set of systematic market risk factors and idiosyncratic risk factors mapped to the portfolio exposures. The relationships between the risk \nARCH CAPITAL\n 61\n2025 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nfactors are estimated using historical data, and the most recent data points are generally given more weight. As of September 30, 2025, our portfolio’s 95th percentile VaR was estimated to be 6.2%, compared to an estimated 5.6% at December 31, 2024. In periods where the volatility of the risk factors mapped to our portfolio’s exposures is higher due to market conditions, the resulting VaR is higher than in other periods.\nEquity Securities.\n At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair value of our investments in equity securities and certain investments accounted for using the equity method with underlying equity strategies totaled $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. These investments are exposed to price risk, which is the potential loss arising from decreases in fair value. An immediate hypothetical 10% decline in the value of each position would reduce the fair value of such investments by approximately $169 million and $149 million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and would have decreased book value per share by approximately $0.46 and $0.40, respectively. An immediate hypothetical 10% increase in the value of each position would increase the fair value of such investments by approximately $169 million and $149 million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and would have increased book value per share by approximately $0.46 and $0.40, respectively.\nInvestment-Related Derivatives. \nAt September 30, 2025, the notional value of all derivative instruments (excluding foreign currency forward contracts which are included in the foreign currency exchange risk analysis below) was $5.8 billion, compared to $5.0 billion at December 31, 2024. If the underlying exposure of each investment-related derivative held at September 30, 2025 depreciated by 100 basis points, it would have resulted in a reduction in net income of approximately $58 million, and a decrease in book value per share of approximately $0.16 per share, compared to $50 million and $0.13 per share, respectively, on investment-related derivatives held at December 31, 2024. If the underlying exposure of each investment-related derivative held at September 30, 2025 appreciated by 100 basis points, it would have resulted in an increase in net income of approximately $58 million, and an increase in book value per share of approximately $0.16 per share, compared to $50 million and $0.13 per share, respectively, on investment-related derivatives held at December 31, 2024. See \nnote 10, “Derivative Instruments,”\n to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures concerning derivatives.\nFor further discussion on investment activity, please refer to “Financial Condition—Investable Assets.”\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk \nForeign currency rate risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Through our subsidiaries and branches located in various foreign countries, we conduct our insurance and reinsurance operations in a variety of local currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. We generally hold investments in foreign currencies which are intended to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our net insurance liabilities. We may also utilize foreign currency forward contracts and currency options as part of our investment strategy. See \nnote 10, “Derivative Instruments,”\n to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe following table provides a summary of our net foreign currency exchange exposures, as well as foreign currency derivatives in place to manage these exposures:\nSeptember 30,\n2025\nDecember 31,\n2024\nNet assets (liabilities), denominated in foreign currencies, excluding shareholders’ equity and derivatives\n$\n(531)\n$\n(815)\nShareholders’ equity denominated in foreign currencies (1)\n1,201 \n1,120 \nNet foreign currency forward contracts outstanding (2)\n294 \n453 \nNet exposures denominated in foreign currencies\n$\n964 \n$\n758 \nPre-tax impact of a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies:\n \n \nShareholders’ equity\n$\n(96)\n$\n(76)\nBook value per share\n$\n(0.26)\n$\n(0.20)\nPre-tax impact of a hypothetical 10% decline of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies:\n \n \nShareholders’ equity\n$\n96 \n$\n76 \nBook value per share\n$\n0.26 \n$\n0.20 \n(1)    Represents capital contributions held in the foreign currencies of our operating units.\n(2)    Represents the net notional value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts.\nAlthough we generally attempt to match the currency of our projected liabilities with investments in the same currencies, from time to time we may elect to over or underweight one or more currencies, which could increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and increase the volatility of our shareholders’ equity. Historical observations indicate a low probability that all foreign currency exchange rates would shift against the U.S. Dollar in the same direction and at the same time and, accordingly, the actual effect of foreign currency rate movements may differ materially from the amounts set forth above. For further discussion on foreign exchange activity, please refer to “Results of Operations.”\nARCH CAPITAL\n 62\n2025 THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q\nTable of Contents\nEffects of Inflation\nGeneral economic inflation has increased in recent quarters and may continue to remain at elevated levels for an extended period of time. The potential also exists, after a catastrophe loss or pandemic events, for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy. This risk may be heightened from time to time by geopolitical tensions, global supply chain disruptions, tariffs, and other contributing factors. This may have a material effect on the adequacy of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, especially in longer-tailed lines of business, and on the market value of our investment portfolio through rising interest rates. The anticipated effects of inflation are considered in our pricing models, reserving processes and exposure management, across all lines of business and types of loss including natural catastrophe events. The actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled and will vary by the specific type of inflation affecting each line of business."
