We sell and service our products through a combination of direct sales and service personnel and a network of independent distributors and sales representatives. We operate in four segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health. \nThrough our Diagnostics segment, we offer a wide range of diagnostic products, which are used primarily to aid in the screening and diagnosis of human diseases. Our primary Diagnostics products include our molecular diagnostic assays, which run on our advanced instrumentation systems (Panther and Panther Fusion), our ThinPrep cytology system, including our Genius Digital Diagnostics System, and the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test. Our Aptima family of molecular diagnostic assays is used to detect, among other things, the infectious microorganisms that cause common sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, or CT/NG; certain high-risk strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV;\n Trichomonas vaginalis\n, the parasite that causes trichomoniasis; Mycoplasma genitalium; and Herpes Simplex viruses 1 and 2. We also offer viral load tests for the quantitation of Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV-1, and human cytomegalo virus, or CMV, for use on our Panther instrument system. In addition, we offer bacterial vaginosis and candida vaginitis assays for the diagnosis of vaginitis, a common and complex ailment affecting millions of women a year. Our assay portfolio also includes diagnostic tests for a range of acute respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2, various strains of influenza and parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as a test for the detection of Group B Streptococcus, or GBS, that are run on the Panther Fusion system, a field upgradeable instrument addition to the base Panther system. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and launched the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay and the Aptima SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay (each of which runs on our standard Panther system) and the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay and the Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2/Flu A/B/RSV assay (which run on our Panther Fusion system). In May 2022, we obtained CE-marking for two new molecular assays, Panther Fusion EBV Quant assay for quantitation of Epstein-Barr virus, and the Panther Fusion BKV Quant assay for quantitation of the BK virus. These two assays are the first quantitative real-time PCR assays on the Panther Fusion system, and, together with the Aptima CMV Quant assay, expand our menu of transplant monitoring assays. The ThinPrep System is primarily used in cytology applications, such as cervical cancer screening, and the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre-term birth. We also generate service revenues from our CLIA-certified laboratory for testing related to breast cancer and all metastatic cancers.\nOur Breast Health segment offers a broad portfolio of solutions for breast imaging, biopsy, breast surgery and pathology. These solutions include 3D digital mammography systems, image analysis software utilizing artificial intelligence, reading \n34\nworkstations, minimally invasive breast biopsy guidance systems, breast biopsy site markers, localization, and specimen radiology systems. Our most advanced breast imaging platforms, Selenia 3D Dimensions and 3Dimensions systems, utilize tomosynthesis to produce 3D images that show multiple contiguous slice images of the breast.\nOur GYN Surgical products include our MyoSure hysteroscopic tissue removal system, our NovaSure endometrial ablation system, our Fluent fluid management system, our Acessa ProVu laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation system, our Gynesonics Sonata intrauterine imaging and transcervical treatment system as well as our CoolSeal vessel sealing portfolio and our JustRight surgical stapler. The MyoSure suite of devices offers four options to provide incision-less removal of fibroids, polyps, and other pathology within the uterus. The NovaSure portfolio is comprised of the NovaSure ADVANCED device and the NovaSure V5 device for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. The Fluent and Fluent Pro fluid management system provides liquid distention during diagnostic and operative hysteroscopic procedures. The Acessa ProVu system is a fully integrated system that uses laparoscopic ultrasound, guidance mapping and radiofrequency ablation to treat nearly all types of fibroids. The Sonata system uses ultrasound and radiofrequency energy to treat fibroids. The CoolSeal portfolio includes the CoolSeal Trinity, CoolSeal Reveal, and CoolSeal Mini advanced bipolar vessel sealing devices. The JustRight 5 mm stapler features a smaller instrument profile and is used for laparoscopic general and pediatric surgery.\nOur Skeletal Health segment’s products include the Horizon DXA, a dual energy x-ray system, which evaluates bone density and performs body composition assessments, and the Fluoroscan Insight FD mini C-arm, which assists in performing minimally invasive orthopedic surgical procedures on a patient’s extremities, such as the hand, wrist, knee, foot, and ankle.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, references to we, us, Hologic or our company refer to Hologic, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nTrademark Notice\nHologic is a trademark of Hologic, Inc.

(“Gynesonics”) for a purchase price of $340.7 million. Gynesonics, located in Redwood City, California, develops and sells a technology intended for diagnostic intrauterine imaging and transcervical treatment of certain symptomatic uterine fibroids, including those associated with heavy menstrual bleeding. Based on our preliminary valuation, we allocated $146.1 million of the purchase price to the value of intangible assets and $191.0 million to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary as we continue to gather information supporting the acquired assets and liabilities. Gynesonics’ results of operations are reported in our GYN Surgical segment from the date of acquisition. In connection with the transaction, we recorded a charge of $22.4 million, of which $1.6 million was included in costs of product revenues and $20.8 million was included in operating expenses, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 for the acceleration of Gynesonics unvested stock options for which the original terms of such awards did not provide for acceleration upon a change-in-control.\nEndomag\nOn July 25, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Endomagnetics Ltd (“Endomag”) for a purchase price of $313.9 million. Endomag, located in the U.K., develops and sells breast surgery localization and lymphatic tracing technologies. Based on our preliminary valuation, we allocated $197.8 million of the purchase price to the value of intangible assets and $140.1 million to goodwill. Endomag’s results of operations are reported in our Breast Health segment.\nDISPOSITION\nSuperSonic Imagine Ultrasound Imaging\nOn September 28, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our SSI ultrasound imaging business to SSH Holdings Limited for a sales price of $1.9 million in cash. Under the terms of the contract, we agreed to fund the SSI business with $33.2 million of cash. The sale was completed on October 3, 2023 (the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2024).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAll dollar amounts in tables are presented in millions.\nProduct Revenues\n \n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nJune 28, 2025\nJune 29, 2024\nChange\nJune 28, 2025\nJune 29, 2024\nChange\n \nAmount\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\nAmount\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\nAmount\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\nAmount\n%\nProduct Revenues\nDiagnostics\n$\n415.1 \n40.5 \n%\n$\n406.9 \n40.2 \n%\n$\n8.2 \n2.0 \n%\n$\n1,271.3 \n41.7 \n%\n$\n1,246.8 \n41.0 \n%\n$\n24.5 \n2.0 \n%\nBreast Health\n200.9 \n19.6 \n%\n228.9 \n22.6 \n%\n(28.0)\n(12.2)\n%\n603.1 \n19.8 \n%\n696.7 \n22.9 \n%\n(93.6)\n(13.4)\n%\nGYN Surgical\n175.7 \n17.2 \n%\n165.4 \n16.4 \n%\n10.3 \n6.2 \n%\n499.7 \n16.4 \n%\n479.6 \n15.8 \n%\n20.1 \n4.2 \n%\nSkeletal Health\n18.7 \n1.8 \n%\n10.0 \n1.0 \n%\n8.7 \n87.0 \n%\n46.9 \n1.5 \n%\n44.1 \n1.4 \n%\n2.8 \n6.3 \n%\n$\n810.4 \n79.1 \n%\n$\n811.2 \n80.2 \n%\n$\n(0.8)\n(0.1)\n%\n$\n2,421.0 \n79.4 \n%\n$\n2,467.2 \n81.1 \n%\n$\n(46.2)\n(1.9)\n%\nWe had a decrease in product revenues in both the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease in the current three month period was primarily due to a decrease in Breast Health revenue partially offset by an increase in GYN Surgical, Skeletal Health and Diagnostics revenues. The decrease in the current nine month period was primarily due to a decrease in Breast Health revenues partially offset by an increase in Diagnostics and GYN Surgical revenue. \nDiagnostics product revenues increased $8.2 million and $24.5 million, respectively, or 2.0% in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in our Molecular Diagnostics business. The increase in Molecular Diagnostics was primarily driven by an increase in sales volumes of our BV/CV assays, which we primarily attribute to increased adoption by our laboratory customers, and an increase in sales volumes of our Fusion respiratory assays due to a more severe flu season and new customer adoption this year compared to the prior year. \n36\nTable of Contents\nThese increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of our two SARS-CoV-2 assays, which we primarily attribute to a normalized level of COVID-19 cases and greater use of rapid tests compared to the prior year. \nBreast Health product revenues decreased $28.0 million and $93.6 million, or 12.2% and 13.4%, respectively, in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in sales of our digital mammography systems, primarily 3D Dimensions systems and related workstation and workflow products, including software, which we primarily attribute to the prior year period having strong demand fulfillment built up from chip shortages, and in the current year periods we experienced longer sales cycles and insufficient sales force execution. In addition, we had a decrease in sales volume of our Trident HD systems in both periods. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of our interventional breast solutions products of $23.2 million and $38.2 million, respectively, primarily due to the Endomag acquisition, which contributed $18.8 million and $41.4 million of product revenue in the current three and nine month periods, respectively, and to a lesser extent an increase in sales of our Brevera needles. \nGYN Surgical product revenues increased $10.3 million and $20.1 million, or 6.2% and 4.2%, respectively, in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to the Gynesonics acquisition, which contributed $8.5 million and $14.7 million in the current three and nine month periods, respectively, an increase in the sales volume of our Fluent fluid management system, an increase in the sales volume of our MyoSure devices and an increase in our NovaSure devices in international markets, primarily Europe, which we primarily attribute to our go-direct strategy and improved reimbursement in certain countries. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in domestic revenues from lower volumes of our NovaSure devices, which we primarily attribute to a shrinking ablation market due to the increased use of alternative therapies and a decrease in sales volumes of our Acessa ProVu systems and related disposables. \nSkeletal Health product revenues increased $8.7 million and $2.8 million or 87.0% and 6.3%, respectively, in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in sales volume of our Horizon DXA systems from pent up demand as the temporary stop-ship implemented during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 due to a non-conformance matter pertaining to electromagnetic compatibility requirements was fully resolved for all Horizon DXA models in the current quarter. This increase was partially offset by lower sales volumes of our Insight FD systems.\nAt the end of any of our fiscal quarters and years, there remain open orders, primarily related to consumable products, that are not fulfilled until the beginning of the subsequent quarter or year, depending on a number of factors, including but not limited to customer ordering patterns, various operational and logistical issues, and in periods prior to fiscal 2025 management discretion to defer shipping orders based on achieving certain financial targets. Consolidated revenues in the current quarter were unfavorably impacted by less than 0.1% and the current nine month period benefited by less than 1% from the timing of such open orders that were not fulfilled in the quarters preceding the three and nine month periods, respectively.\n37\nTable of Contents\nProduct revenues by geography as a percentage of total product revenues were as follows:\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nJune 28, 2025\nJune 29, 2024\nJune 28, 2025\nJune 29, 2024\nUnited States\n71.9 \n%\n73.7 \n%\n71.8 \n%\n72.8 \n%\nEurope\n15.9 \n%\n13.6 \n%\n16.0 \n%\n14.5 \n%\nAsia-Pacific\n6.0 \n%\n6.8 \n%\n6.0 \n%\n6.6 \n%\nRest of World\n6.2 \n%\n5.9 \n%\n6.2 \n%\n6.1 \n%\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nIn the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, the percentage of product revenue derived from Europe increased, while the percentage of product revenue derived from the United States and Asia-Pacific decreased. The increase in Europe was primarily due to an increase in sales of our GYN Surgical products, primarily Sonata disposables from the Gynesonics acquisition as well as our MyoSure and NovaSure devices, and to a lesser extent an increase in sales of our Genius systems and in the current nine month period, a minimum commitment penalty payment received from the German government for SARS-CoV-2 assays. The decrease in the United States in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in sales of our Breast Health products, specifically our 3D Dimensions systems and related workflow and workstation products as discussed above. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in sales of our Diagnostics products, primarily our BV/CV and Fusion respiratory assays. The decrease in Asia-Pacific was primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes of our ThinPrep Pap Tests, HPV assays and 3D Dimensions systems in China, which we primarily attribute to the trade war between China and the United States and other Chinese policies that impact sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in Horizon DXA systems in Japan in the current three month period as the stop ship was fully lifted.\nService and Other Revenues\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nJune 28, 2025\nJune 29, 2024\nChange\nJune 28, 2025\nJune 29, 2024\nChange\n \nAmount\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\nAmount\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\nAmount\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\nAmount\n%\nService and Other Revenues\n$\n213.4 \n20.8 \n%\n$\n200.2 \n19.8 \n%\n$\n13.2 \n6.6 \n%\n$\n629.9 \n20.6 \n%\n$\n575.1 \n18.9 \n%\n$\n54.8 \n9.5 \n%\nService and other revenues consist primarily of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing support and maintenance services, installation and repair of our products.

In addition, in the current nine month period, we had higher lab testing volumes from our Biotheranostics business, which we primarily attribute to greater adoption of our Breast Cancer Index test.\nCost of Product Revenues\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nJune 28, 2025\nJune 29, 2024\nChange\nJune 28, 2025\nJune 29, 2024\nChange\n \nAmount\n% of\nProduct\nRevenue\nAmount\n% of\nProduct\nRevenue\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n% of\nProduct\nRevenue\nAmount\n% of\nProduct\nRevenue\nAmount\n%\nCost of Product Revenues\n$\n310.5 \n38.3 \n%\n$\n298.2 \n36.8 \n%\n$\n12.3 \n4.1 \n%\n$\n916.6 \n37.9 \n%\n$\n913.9 \n37.0 \n%\n$\n2.7 \n0.3 \n%\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\n41.1 \n5.1 \n%\n44.4 \n5.5 \n%\n(3.3)\n(7.3)\n%\n135.3 \n5.6 \n%\n134.9 \n5.5 \n%\n0.4 \n0.3 \n%\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\n— \n— \n%\n13.3 \n1.6 \n%\n(13.3)\n**\n183.4 \n7.6 \n%\n39.2 \n1.6 \n%\n144.2 \n**\n$\n351.6 \n43.4 \n%\n$\n355.9 \n43.9 \n%\n$\n(4.3)\n(1.2)\n%\n$\n1,235.3 \n51.0 \n%\n$\n1,088.0 \n44.1 \n%\n$\n147.3 \n13.5 \n%\n38\nTable of Contents\nCost of Product Revenues.\n The cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was 38.3% and 37.9% respectively, in the current three and nine month periods compared to 36.8% and 37.0%, respectively, in the corresponding periods in the prior year. \nDiagnostics’ product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in sales volume of our Women’s Health assays, primarily BV/CV, and Fusion respiratory assays, favorable manufacturing variances from higher production volumes and lower scrap. Partially offsetting this increase in gross margin was a decrease in Covid assay volumes, an increase in sustaining on-market support and higher amortization and service costs from a larger installed base. In the current nine month period, costs were lower as there we no period charges from the Mobidiag business as a result of the facility closure during the second half of fiscal 2024.\nBreast Health’s product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes of our higher margin products, primarily 3D Dimensions and related workstation and workflow products (including software) and to a lesser extent unfavorable manufacturing variances from lower production volumes and higher excess and obsolescence charges, partially offset by the inclusion of Endomag, which has higher margins than the legacy business. Also contributing to the increase in costs as a percentage of revenue in the current nine month period was the step-up to fair value for the acquired Endomag inventory sold during the period.\nGYN Surgical’s product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in domestic sales volume of our NovaSure devices, an increase in sales of our Fluent fluid management system and Gynesonics systems, which have lower margins, and a decrease in domestic average selling prices of our MyoSure devices, and in the current nine month period an increase from the step-up to fair value for the acquired Gynesonics inventory sold during the second quarter of the current fiscal year. The increase in costs as a percentage of revenue in both current periods was partially offset by an increase in sales volume of our MyoSure and NovaSure devices in international markets.\nSkeletal Health’s product costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in the current three month period compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in Horizon DXA system volumes and improved mix of higher margin versions and the prior year period included a $5.0 million charge related to the Horizon DXA system stop ship that was implemented during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by a charge for non-cancelable purchase commitments related to the Insight FD system that we will stop selling in fiscal 2026, and lower average selling prices. Product costs as a percentage of revenue increased in the current nine month period compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to a charge for non-cancelable purchase commitments related to the Insight FD system, an increase in costs to rework the Horizon DXA systems due to a non-conformance pertaining to electromagnetic compatibility requirements as discussed above, and a decrease in the average selling prices of our Horizon DXA systems and Insight FD systems.\nThe U.S. government implemented reciprocal tariffs in April 2025 to accomplish certain policy goals and is currently negotiating trade agreements with many countries. Currently, the government has implemented a baseline 10% tariff on imports into the U.S., with certain exceptions. U.S. tariffs are paid by the entity that is the importer of record, and as such, we are liable for those products and materials imported into the U.S. We manufacture the majority of our GYN Surgical and Breast Health interventional breast solutions disposable products at our Costa Rica facility, which is subject to the 10% tariff. We also utilize a third-party manufacturer based in Mexico to produce our Skeletal Health products. Goods from Mexico are subject to a 25% tariff, however, the finished goods we import from Mexico are predominantly exempt from tariffs under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”). Based on the mitigation efforts we expect to take, we estimate that, if maintained at current levels, the impact of direct tariff costs to us on a quarterly basis will be approximately $10 million to $12 million, which is lower than our initial estimate of approximately $20 million to $25 million previously disclosed in our second quarter’s Form 10-Q. This estimate does not consider potential cost increases from our vendors and suppliers. We continue to evaluate the status of the evolving tariffs as well as various measures to mitigate the impact of tariffs, however we can give no assurances on the success of these efforts. Additional tariffs or other trade restrictions by the U.S. or other countries where we do significant business or applicable to specific industries relevant to our business, could further materially impact our results in the future.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets.\n Amortization of intangible assets included in cost of product revenues relates to acquired developed technology, which is generally amortized over its estimated useful life of between 10 and 15 years. Amortization expense decreased in the current three month period compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to lower amortization of the Acessa, Bolder, Diagenode and Mobidiag developed technology assets as a result of impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and the Biozorb developed technology asset as a result of impairment charges recorded in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2024, partially offset by an increase in amortization \n39\nTable of Contents\nexpense from developed technology assets acquired in the Endomag and Gynesonics acquisitions. Amortization expense increased in the current nine month period compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in amortization expense from the Endomag and Gynesonics acquisitions, partially offset by lower amortization of the Acessa, Bolder, Diagenode, Mobidiag and Biozorb developed technology assets as a result of the impairments discussed above. \nImpairment of Intangible Assets. \nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2025, in connection with commencing our company-wide strategic planning process, we identified indicators of impairment in our Acessa, Bolder, Diagenode and Mobidiag businesses. As a result, we performed undiscounted cash flow analyses pursuant to ASC 360, \nProperty, Plant and Equipment - Overall\n, to determine if the cash flows expected to be generated by these product lines over the remaining estimated useful lives of their primary assets were sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset groups. Based on these analyses, the undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets. Therefore, we were required to perform Step 3 of the impairment test and determine the fair value of the asset groups. To estimate the fair value of the asset groups, we utilized the income approach, which is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, and calculated the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to the asset groups and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Based on these analyses, the fair value of the Acessa, Bolder, Diagenode and Mobidiag asset groups were below their carrying values, and we recorded impairment charges aggregating $204.0 million of which $183.4 million of the charge was allocated to developed technology.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2024, in connection with commencing our company-wide annual strategic planning process, we identified indicators of impairment in our BioZorb product line, which was part of the Focal acquisition. As a result, we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Based on this analysis the undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets. Therefore, we were required to perform Step 3 of the impairment test and determine the fair value of the asset group. To estimate the fair value of the asset group, we utilized a DCF analysis. Based on this analysis, the fair value of the BioZorb asset group was below its carrying value, and we recorded an impairment charge of $26.8 million of which $25.9 million of the charge was allocated to developed technology. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Federal Drug Administration classified a prior safety notice for the BioZorb Marker as a Class I recall. This was a technical classification of a prior safety notice only, not a product removal. Following this, we lowered our forecast for this product line, which was an indicator of impairment. Accordingly, we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis and determined the cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group. We performed a fair value analysis and determined that the fair value of the asset group was immaterial. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $13.3 million to developed technology, to fully write-off the asset.

The increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in service contract and preventative maintenance revenue from our expanded installed base of digital mammography systems with lower field service expense. In addition, the increase in the current nine month period was also due to an increase in lab testing revenue from Biotheranostics, which has higher margins than our legacy service business.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nJune 28, 2025\nJune 29, 2024\nChange\nJune 28, 2025\nJune 29, 2024\nChange\n \nAmount\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\nAmount\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\nAmount\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\nAmount\n%\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development\n$\n61.4 \n6.0 \n%\n$\n64.1 \n6.3 \n%\n$\n(2.7)\n(4.3)\n%\n$\n183.1 \n6.0 \n%\n$\n205.5 \n6.8 \n%\n$\n(22.4)\n(10.9)\n%\nSelling and marketing\n152.2 \n14.9 \n%\n146.3 \n14.5 \n%\n5.9 \n4.0 \n%\n472.8 \n15.5 \n%\n439.4 \n14.4 \n%\n33.4 \n7.6 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n99.1 \n9.7 \n%\n94.0 \n9.3 \n%\n5.1 \n5.4 \n%\n334.5 \n11.0 \n%\n306.2 \n10.1 \n%\n28.3 \n9.2 \n%\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n3.0 \n0.3 \n%\n5.3 \n0.5 \n%\n(2.3)\n(43.4)\n%\n11.5 \n0.4 \n%\n24.3 \n0.8 \n%\n(12.8)\n(52.7)\n%\nImpairment of intangible assets\n— \n— \n%\n0.4 \n— \n%\n(0.4)\n**\n37.5 \n1.2 \n%\n5.6 \n0.2 \n%\n31.9 \n569.6 \n%\nContingent consideration - fair value adjustment\n— \n— \n%\n— \n— \n%\n— \n**\n— \n— \n%\n1.7 \n0.1 \n%\n(1.7)\n100.0 \n%\nRestructuring charges\n6.3 \n0.6 \n%\n6.2 \n0.6 \n%\n0.1 \n**\n17.6 \n0.6 \n%\n34.8 \n1.1 \n%\n(17.2)\n**\n$\n322.0 \n31.6 \n%\n$\n316.3 \n31.2 \n%\n$\n5.7 \n1.8 \n%\n$\n1,057.0 \n34.6 \n%\n$\n1,017.5 \n33.5 \n%\n$\n39.5 \n3.9 \n%\n** Percentage not meaningful\nResearch and Development Expenses.\n Research and development expenses decreased 4.3% and 10.9%, respectively, in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease in the current three and nine months periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits from lower headcount, primarily within Diagnostics and Breast Health (excluding Endomag), lower bonus expense and a decrease in project spend partially offset by the inclusion of expenses of $2.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively, related to the Endomag acquisition, and $1.8 million and $5.9 million, respectively, related to the Gynesonics acquisition, a decrease in credits recorded for funds received from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) grant to obtain FDA approval of our SARS-CoV-2 assays, and an increase in consulting spend related to the quality organization and addressing matters raised by the FDA. The decrease in the current nine month period is also due to the prior year period included a $10.0 million charge related to the purchase of intellectual property to be used in a Diagnostics development project that had no future alternative use. At any point in time, we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary from period to period.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses.\n Selling and marketing expenses increased 4.0% and 7.6%, respectively, in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of expenses of $6.6 million and $26.0 million, respectively, from the Endomag acquisition which included a one-time contract termination fee in the current nine month period, the inclusion of expenses of $6.3 million and $18.7 million, respectively, from the Gynesonics acquisition, which included $6.8 million of expense for the acceleration and cash out of unvested stock options in connection with the acquisition in the current nine month period, partially offset by a decrease in marketing initiatives.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses.\n General and administrative expenses increased 5.4% and 9.2%, respectively, in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of expenses of $1.9 million and $7.0 million, respectively, from the Endomag acquisition, the inclusion of expenses of $1.6 million and $16.6 million, respectively, from the Gynesonics acquisition which included $12.2 million for the acceleration and cash out of unvested stock options in the current nine month period, and an increase in consulting, partially offset by lower bonus expense. In the current three month period, we also had higher expense from our deferred compensation plan due to improved market performance. In addition, in the current nine month period we had an increase in legal fees, IT project spend, acquisition transaction expenses and stock compensation expense, partially offset by lower expense from our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in bad debt expense.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets.\n Amortization of acquired intangible assets primarily results from customer relationships and trade names related to our acquisitions. These intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between 5 and 30 years. Amortization expense decreased in the current three and nine month periods primarily \n41\nTable of Contents\ndue to lower amortization of the Bolder and Diagenode customer relationship and trade name intangible assets as a result of impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and accelerated amortization in the prior year period of customer relationship and trade name intangible assets acquired in the Mobidiag acquisition.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets.\n During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as discussed above, we recorded aggregate impairment charges of $204.0 million related to our Acessa, Bolder, Diagenode and Mobidiag businesses of which $20.5 million was allocated to customer lists and trade names and written off to operating expenses. We also recorded an impairment charge of $16.9 million to record our IPR&D asset from the Mobidiag acquisition to fair value. The reduction in fair value was primarily due to a reduction in forecasted revenues and timing of completing the project. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as discussed above, we recorded an additional impairment charge related to our BioZorb product line of $13.7 million of which $0.4 million was allocated to trade names. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded an impairment charge of $26.8 million related to our BioZorb product line of which $0.9 million was allocated to trade names and written off to operating expenses. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024 we recorded an impairment charge of $4.3 million to record our IPR&D asset from the Mobidiag acquisition to fair value. The reduction in fair value was primarily due to a reduction in forecasted revenues and timing of completing the project. For additional information, please refer to Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements.\nRestructuring Charges.\n We have implemented various cost reduction initiatives to align our cost structure with our operations and related integration activities. These actions have primarily resulted in the termination of employees and the shutdown of certain facilities. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we made the decision to reorganize and reduce costs in China resulting in the termination of certain employees across various divisions and departments. Charges of $4.1 million were recorded for severance benefits during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, and the action was completed in the quarter. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025 we made various decisions to reorganize certain departments and reduce costs resulting in the termination of certain employees in the Breast Health and Surgical divisions and Corporate functions in the U.S. across multiple departments. Charges of $5.0 million were recorded for severance benefits during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. These actions were completed as of March 29, 2025. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we further refined our strategy for the Mobidiag business and decided to discontinue the manufacture and sale of certain products. This decision resulted in the closure of facilities in Finland and France as we moved the development activities and operations to our San Diego, California location. As a result, we recorded accelerated depreciation of $7.2 million and a lease impairment charge of $12.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded the minimum statutory severance benefit for the affected French employees of $1.8 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we finalized negotiations with the respective Works Councils and recorded severance charges of $4.0 million related to this action, and during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded an additional $3.9 million. For the three and nine month periods ended June 28, 2025, we recorded severance benefit charges for the affected employee groups of $1.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively. This action was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.

Interest expense decreased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to a lower principal balance outstanding under our 2021 Credit Agreement and a reduction in interest rates as the U.S. Federal Reserve reduced the Federal Funds Rate over the last twelve months. In the current nine month period, the decrease was partially offset by a reduction of $9.4 million received under interest rate swap agreements primarily due to a decrease in our overall hedged principal amount from $1.0 billion to $500 million and an increase in the fixed SOFR component under those agreements.\nOther Income (Expense), net\n \n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nJune 28,\n2025\nJune 29,\n2024\nChange\nJune 28,\n2025\nJune 29,\n2024\nChange\n \nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nOther Income (Expense), net\n$\n(7.1)\n$\n0.2 \n$\n(7.3)\n**\n$\n9.6 \n$\n0.8 \n$\n8.8 \n**\n** Percentage not meaningful\nFor the current three month period, this account primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange losses of $10.6 million primarily from the mark-to-market of foreign currency contracts used to hedge operating results and a $2.5 million ownership share loss from our investment in Maverix Medical. These losses were partially offset by a gain of $5.9 million from the change in cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plan driven by stock market gains. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, this account primarily consisted of a gain of $0.9 million from the change in cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plan driven by stock market gains and net foreign currency exchange gains of $0.4 million primarily from the mark-to-market of foreign currency contracts used to hedge operating results, partially offset by a $0.9 million ownership share loss from our investment in Maverix Medical. \nFor the current nine month period, this account primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange gains of $11.5 million primarily from the mark-to-market of foreign currency contracts used to hedge operating results and to a lesser extent, a gain of $3.9 million from the change in cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plan driven by stock market gains. These gains were partially offset by a $5.9 million ownership share loss from our investment in Maverix Medical. For the corresponding nine month period in the prior year, this account primarily consisted of a gain of $10.9 million from the change in cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our deferred compensation plan driven by stock market gains.

Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 29, 2024 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a discrete tax benefit of $107.2 million related to a worthless stock deduction on the investment in one of our international subsidiaries recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the geographic mix of income earned by our international subsidiaries, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate, and the U.S. deduction for foreign derived intangible income.\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe operate in four segments: Diagnostics, Breast Health, GYN Surgical and Skeletal Health. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024. We measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income. Revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above. The discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment.\nDiagnostics\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nJune 28,\n2025\nJune 29,\n2024\nChange\nJune 28,\n2025\nJune 29,\n2024\nChange\n \nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nTotal Revenues\n$\n448.9 \n$\n440.8 \n$\n8.1 \n1.8 \n%\n$\n1,373.1 \n$\n1,338.7 \n$\n34.4 \n2.6 \n%\nOperating Income\n$\n111.1 \n$\n89.7 \n$\n21.4 \n23.9 \n%\n$\n249.5 \n$\n210.1 \n$\n39.4 \n18.8 \n%\nOperating Income as a % of Segment Revenue\n24.7 \n%\n20.3 \n%\n18.2 \n%\n15.7 \n%\nDiagnostics revenues increased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in product revenue discussed above. The increase in revenue in the current nine month period compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was also due to higher lab testing revenue from our Biotheranostics business. \nOperating income for this business segment increased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase in the current three month period was primarily due to an increase in gross profit and a decrease in operating expenses. The increase in the current nine month period was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit. Gross margin was 55.0% and 49.9%, respectively, in the current three and nine month periods compared to 53.1% and 52.2%, respectively, in the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase in the current three month period compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in sales volumes of our Women’s Health assays, primarily BV/CV assays, and Fusion respiratory assays, favorable manufacturing variances from higher production volumes and lower scrap and a decrease in intangible asset amortization for the Mobidiag and Diagenode developed technology assets as a result of impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, partially offset by a decrease in Covid assay volumes, an increase in sustaining on-market support and higher amortization and service costs from a larger installed base. The decrease in the current nine month period compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily due to the impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of the current year related to Diagenode and Mobidiag aggregating $73.1 million, a decrease in Covid assay volumes and an increase in sustaining on-market support partially offset by the increase in sales volume of our Women’s Health assays, primarily BV/CV assays, favorable manufacturing variances from higher production volumes, and no period charges from the Mobidiag business as a result of the facility closure during the second half of fiscal 2024. In addition, the decline in gross margin was partially offset by an increase in Biotheranostics lab testing revenue which has higher margins.\nOperating expenses decreased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to lower research and development headcount from prior year restructuring actions, lower bonus expense, and a decrease in marketing initiatives. In addition, in the current nine month period we had a decrease in operating expenses as the prior year period included a lease impairment charge of $12.5 million, a $10.0 million charge related to the purchase of intellectual property that had no future alternative use, and accelerated amortization expense of acquired intangible assets which resulted in lower amortization expense of acquired intangible assets in the current nine month period. This was partially offset by an increase in impairment charges in the current nine month period related to the in-process research and \n44\nTable of Contents\ndevelopment intangible asset from our Mobidiag business and an intangible asset from our Diagenode business as discussed above.\nBreast Health\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nJune 28,\n2025\nJune 29,\n2024\nChange\nJune 28,\n2025\nJune 29,\n2024\nChange\n \nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nTotal Revenues\n$\n365.2 \n$\n385.0 \n$\n(19.8)\n(5.1)\n%\n$\n1,090.4 \n$\n1,147.3 \n$\n(56.9)\n(5.0)\n%\nOperating Income\n$\n99.6 \n$\n102.4 \n$\n(2.8)\n(2.7)\n%\n$\n262.8 \n$\n296.2 \n$\n(33.4)\n(11.3)\n%\nOperating Income as a % of Segment Revenue\n27.3 \n%\n26.6 \n%\n24.1 \n%\n25.8 \n%\nBreast Health revenues decreased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year due to a decrease in product revenues as discussed above partially offset by an increase in service revenue.\nOperating income for this business segment decreased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in gross profit from the reduction in revenues and an increase in operating expenses. Gross margin was 57.0% and 56.4%, respectively, in the current three and nine month periods compared to 54.3% and 54.3%, respectively, in the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase in gross margin in the current three and nine month periods was primarily driven by the prior year periods’ inclusion of intangible asset impairment charges of $13.3 million and $39.2 million, respectively, related to Biozorb as discussed above, an increase in service contract revenue from our expanded installed base with lower field service expense, and the inclusion of Endomag, partially offset by the decrease in sales of 3D Dimensions systems and related workstations and workflow products (including software), higher intangible asset amortization related to the Endomag acquisition, and unfavorable manufacturing variances from lower production volumes and higher excess and obsolescence charges.\nOperating expenses increased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from the Endomag acquisition of $11.2 million and $40.5 million, respectively.

The decrease in the current three month period was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses partially offset by an increase in gross profit. The decrease in the current nine month period was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit and an increase in operating expenses. Gross margin was 67.2% and 43.4%, respectively, in the current three and nine month periods compared to 69.6% and 67.7%, respectively, in the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease in gross margin in the current three month period compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily due to higher sales volumes of our lower margin Fluent Fluid Management systems and Sonata products, lower sales volumes of our higher margin NovaSure devices in the U.S. and a decrease in average selling prices of our MyoSure devices in the U.S. The decrease in gross margin in the current nine month period compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily due to impairment charges related to the Acessa and Bolder developed technology assets aggregating $110.4 \n45\nTable of Contents\nmillion recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and the step-up to fair value for the acquired Gynesonics inventory sold, and to a lesser extent an increase in sales of lower margin products discussed above.\nOperating expenses increased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from the Gynesonics acquisition of $9.9 million and $44.2 million, respectively, which included $20.8 million for the acceleration of unvested stock options in connection with the transaction within the current nine month period. The increase in the current nine month period was also due to impairment charges related to intangible assets from our Acessa and Bolder businesses as discussed above, aggregating $16.0 million included in operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense in the current nine month period.\nSkeletal Health\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nJune 28,\n2025\nJune 29,\n2024\nChange\nJune 28,\n2025\nJune 29,\n2024\nChange\n \nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nTotal Revenues\n$\n31.3 \n$\n19.0 \n$\n12.3 \n64.7 \n%\n$\n80.1 \n$\n71.5 \n$\n8.6 \n12.0 \n%\nOperating Income\n$\n(4.9)\n$\n(4.8)\n$\n(0.1)\n2.1 \n%\n$\n(5.6)\n$\n2.0 \n$\n(7.6)\n(380.0)\n%\nOperating Income as a % of Segment Revenue\n(15.5)\n%\n(25.3)\n%\n(7.0)\n%\n2.7 \n%\nSkeletal Health revenues increased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in product revenues as discussed above. \nOperating income for this business segment remained relatively flat in the current three month period compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

Gross margin was 4.6% and 17.6% in the current three and nine month periods, respectively, compared to 4.9% and 27.9% in the corresponding periods in the prior year, respectively. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a charge for non-cancelable purchase commitments related to the Insight FD system that we will stop selling in fiscal 2026, lower average selling prices and to a lesser extent increased costs related to the Horizon DXA field remediation, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes of our Horizon DXA systems as the temporary stop-ship implemented in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was fully resolved during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, and the prior year period included a $5.0 million warranty charge related to the Horizon DXA stop-ship.\nOperating expenses increased in the current three and nine month periods compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase in allocated administration expenses.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt June 28, 2025, we had $2,458.9 million of working capital and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,735.2 million. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $425.0 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2025 primarily due to cash used in investing and financing activities primarily related to repurchases of our common stock, cash paid to acquire Gynesonics, capital expenditures and strategic investments, partially offset by cash generated from operating activities and maturities of available-for-sale securities.\nIn the first nine months of fiscal 2025, our operating activities provided cash of $702.0 million, primarily due to net income of $378.5 million, non-cash charges for intangible asset impairments of $220.9 million, depreciation and amortization aggregating $220.3 million, and stock-based compensation expense of $72.0 million. These adjustments to net income were partially offset by a decrease in net deferred income taxes of $111.3 million primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets and the impairments of acquired intangible assets recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Cash provided by operations included a net cash outflow of $93.4 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. This cash outflow was primarily driven by a decrease of $61.4 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to the payment of our annual bonuses, timing of payroll and restructuring payments, an increase in inventory of $34.7 million to meet expected demand across our primary product lines and the build of Breast Health capital equipment related to the transfer of manufacturing to Newark, Delaware from Danbury, Connecticut and a decrease in accounts payable of $12.4 million due to the timing of payments. \n46\nIn the first nine months of fiscal 2025, our investing activities used cash of $350.6 million primarily due to a $321.5 million net payment for the Gynesonics acquisition, capital expenditures of $106.6 million, which primarily consisted of the placement of equipment under customer usage agreements and purchase of manufacturing equipment, $33.0 million for purchases of additional strategic investments and $15.4 million for purchases of intellectual property licenses. These cash outflows were partially offset by $128.0 million of maturities on our available-for-sale securities. \nIn the first nine months of fiscal 2025, our financing activities used cash of $778.8 million primarily due to $752.9 million for repurchases of our common stock, including a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, $28.1 million for debt principal payments under our 2021 Credit Agreement, and $22.0 million for the payment of employee taxes withheld for the net share settlement of vested restricted stock units. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds of $27.7 million from our equity plans. \nDebt\nWe had total recorded debt outstanding of $2.51 billion at June 28, 2025, which was comprised of amounts outstanding under our then existing Credit Agreement of $1.17 billion (principal of $1.17 billion), 2029 Senior Notes of $942.4 million (principal of $950.0 million), and 2028 Senior Notes of $398.1 million (principal of $400.0 million).\n2025 Credit Agreement (Subsequent Event)\nOn July 15, 2025, we refinanced our existing 2021 Term Loan and 2021 Revolver with Bank of America, N.A. in its capacity as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and certain other lenders from time to time party thereto (the “2021 Credit Agreement”) by entering into a Refinancing Amendment (the “2025 Credit Agreement”). Borrowings under the 2025 Credit Agreement are secured by first-priority liens on, and a first priority security interest in, substantially all of our and our Subsidiary Guarantors’ U.S. assets. The credit facilities (the “2025 Credit Facilities”) under the 2025 Credit Agreement consist of:\n•\nA $1.17 billion secured term loan (“2025 Term Loan”) with a stated maturity date of July 15, 2030; and\n•\nA secured revolving credit facility (the “2025 Revolver”) under which the Borrowers may borrow up to $1.25 billion, subject to certain sublimits, with a stated maturity date of July 15, 2030.\nBorrowings under the 2025 Credit Agreement, other than Swing Line Loans, bear interest, at our option, at the Base Rate, at the Alternative Currency Daily Rate, at the Alternative Currency Term Rate, or as Term SOFR Loans, in each case plus the Applicable Rate (in each case, as defined in Refinancing Amendment No. 4). \nWe are required to make scheduled principal payments under the 2025 Term Loan in increasing amounts, which currently range from $2.92 million per three-month period to $14.61 million per three-month period commencing with the three-month period ending on September 25, 2026. The remaining scheduled balance of $1.04 billion (or such lesser aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans then outstanding) on the 2025 Term Loan and any amounts outstanding under the 2025 Revolver are due at their respective maturities. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2025 Credit Agreement, we may be required to make certain mandatory prepayments from the net proceeds of specified types of asset sales (subject to certain reinvestment rights), debt issuances (excluding permitted debt) and insurance recoveries (subject to certain reinvestment rights). Certain mandatory prepayments are subject to reduction or elimination if certain financial covenants are met. Subject to certain limitations, we may voluntarily prepay any of the 2025 Credit Facilities without premium or penalty.\nThe 2025 Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities, including the requirement that we maintain two financial ratios (a total net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio) measured as of the last day of each quarter for the previous twelve-month period. These covenants are consistent with those under the 2021 Credit Agreement, and we were in compliance with these covenants as of June 28, 2025.\n47\n2028 Senior Notes\nThe total aggregate principal balance of the 2028 Senior Notes is $400.0 million. The 2028 Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. The 2028 Senior Notes mature on February 1, 2028 and bear interest at the rate of 4.625% per year, payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. We have the option to redeem the 2028 Senior Notes on or after: February 1, 2025 through February 1, 2026 at 100.770% of par; and February 1, 2026 and thereafter at 100% of par. In addition, if there is a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 2028 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.\n2029 Senior Notes\nThe total aggregate principal balance of the 2029 Senior Notes is $950.0 million. The 2029 Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain domestic subsidiaries. The 2029 Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2029 and bear interest at the rate of 3.250% per year, payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. We have the option to redeem the 2029 Senior Notes on or after: September 28, 2024 through September 27, 2025 at 100.813% of par; and September 28, 2025 and thereafter at 100% of par. In addition, if there is a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 2029 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.\nStock Repurchase Program\n \nOn September 12, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, with a five-year term, to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding stock. As of June 28, 2025, $937.5 million remained unused under this authorization.\nThe timing of share repurchases will be based upon our continuing analysis of market, financial, and other factors. Repurchases under the authorized share repurchase plan may be made using a variety of methods, which may include, but are not limited to, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase agreements, or purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan\n \nunder the Exchange Act. The authorized share repurchase plan may be suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in several legal proceedings, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries and investigations arising out of the ordinary course of our business. In connection with these legal proceedings, claims, inspections, inquiries or investigations, management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement, if any, of these proceedings. These estimates are developed, as applicable in consultation with outside counsel, and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies. In accordance with ASC 450, \nContingencies\n, loss contingencies are accrued if, in the opinion of management, an adverse outcome is probable and such financial outcome can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings. Information with respect to this disclosure may be found in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nFuture Liquidity Considerations\nWe expect to continue to review and evaluate potential strategic transactions that we believe will complement our current or future business. Subject to the “Risk Factors,” if any, set forth or incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as those described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 or any other of our subsequently filed reports, and the general disclaimers set forth in our “Cautionary Statement” regarding forward-looking statements at the outset of this Item 2, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments, cash flows from operations, and the cash available under our 2025 Revolver will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our existing commitments and our expected normal operations and debt payments over the next twelve months. Our longer-term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance. We may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures, repayment of debt, acquisitions, strategic transactions or other investments. As described above, we have significant indebtedness outstanding under our 2025 Credit Agreement, \n48\n2028 Senior Notes, and 2029 Senior Notes. These capital requirements could be substantial. For a description of risks to our operating performance and our indebtedness, see the “Risk Factors” set forth or incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as those described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our interim consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, valuations, purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations, expected future cash flows including growth rates, discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets and goodwill, estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill, amortization methods and periods, warranty reserves, certain accrued expenses, restructuring and other related charges, stock-based compensation, contingent liabilities, tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. Any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For a discussion of how these and other factors may affect our business, see the “Cautionary Statement” regarding forward-looking statements set forth at the outset of this Item 2 and the “Risk Factors” set forth or incorporated by reference in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as those described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 or any other of our subsequently filed reports.\nThe critical accounting estimates that we believe affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this report are described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or estimates from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024."
