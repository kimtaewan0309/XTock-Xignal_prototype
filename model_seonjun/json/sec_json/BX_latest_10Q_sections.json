Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n \nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Blackstone Inc.’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included within this Quarterly Report on \nForm 10-Q.\n \n \nIn this report, references to “Blackstone,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to Blackstone Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. \n \nOur Business \n \nBlackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager. We generate revenue from fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with funds, fund investors and fund portfolio companies (including management, transaction and monitoring fees), and from capital markets services. We also invest in the funds we manage and we are entitled to a \npro-rata\n share of the income of the fund (a \n“pro-rata\n allocation”). In addition to a \npro-rata\n allocation, and assuming certain investment returns are achieved, we are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the limited partners, commonly referred to as carried interest (“Performance Allocations”). In certain investment fund structures, we receive a contractual incentive fee from the fund based on achieving certain investment returns (an “Incentive Fee,” and together with Performance Allocations, “Performance Revenues”). The composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different business units we operate. Net investment gains and investment income generated by Blackstone Funds are driven by the performance of underlying investments in such funds as well as overall market conditions. Fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of our funds’ portfolio companies and other investments, the industries in which they operate, the overall economy and other market conditions. \n \nOur business is organized into four segments: \n \nReal Estate \n \nOur Real Estate business is a global leader in real estate investing and operates as one globally integrated business, with investments across the globe, including in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our real estate investment teams seek to utilize our global expertise and presence to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our investors. \n\n\n \n \n71 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Blackstone Real Estate Partners (“BREP”) business is geographically diversified and targets a broad range of opportunistic real estate and real estate-related investments. The BREP platform includes global funds as well as funds focused specifically on Europe or Asia investments. BREP seeks to invest thematically in high-quality assets, focusing where we see outsized growth potential driven by global economic and demographic trends. BREP has made significant investments in logistics, data centers, rental housing, hospitality, office and retail properties around the world, as well as in a variety of real estate operating companies. \n \nOur Core+ real estate strategy invests in substantially stabilized real estate globally, primarily through perpetual capital vehicles. The strategy includes our (a) Blackstone Property Partners (“BPP”) funds, which are focused on high-quality assets in the Americas, Europe and Asia and \n(b) non-listed\n real estate investment trust (“REIT”) Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“BREIT”) and Blackstone European Property Income (“BEPIF”) vehicles, which provide income-focused individual investors access to institutional quality real estate primarily in the Americas and Europe, respectively. \n \nOur Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies (“BREDS”) platform primarily targets real estate-related debt investment opportunities. BREDS invests in both public and private markets, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. BREDS’ scale and investment mandates enable it to provide a variety of lending options for our borrowers and investment options for our investors, including commercial real estate mortgage loans and liquid real estate-related debt securities. The BREDS platform includes high-yield real estate debt funds, liquid real estate debt funds, capital managed on behalf of our Credit & Insurance segment, and Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc. (“BXMT”), a NYSE-listed mortgage REIT. \n \nPrivate Equity \n \nOur Private Equity segment includes: (a) Private Equity Strategies (described below), (b) Infrastructure, which includes (1) our infrastructure-focused funds for institutional investors with a primary focus on the U.S. and Europe (Blackstone Infrastructure Partners or “BIP”) and (2) a private wealth-focused platform offering eligible individual investors access to our infrastructure capabilities (Blackstone Infrastructure Strategies or “BXINFRA”), (c) our secondaries business (“Secondaries”), which includes Strategic Partners Fund Solutions (“Strategic Partners”) and our GP Stakes business (“Blackstone GP Stakes” or “BXGP”), (d) our capital markets services business (Blackstone Capital Markets or “BXCM”) and (e) a private wealth-focused platform offering eligible individuals exposure to certain of Blackstone’s key illiquid investment strategies through a single commitment (Blackstone Total Alternatives Solution or “BTAS”). \n \nOur Private Equity Strategies include: (a) our Corporate Private Equity business (described below), (b) our opportunistic investment platform that invests flexibly across asset classes, industries and geographies (Blackstone Tactical Opportunities or “Tactical Opportunities”), (c) our life sciences investment platform (Blackstone Life Sciences or “BXLS”), (d) our growth equity investment platform (Blackstone Growth or “BXG”) and (e) a private wealth-focused platform offering eligible individual investors access to Blackstone’s private equity capabilities (Blackstone Private Equity Strategies Fund or “BXPE”). \n \nOur Corporate Private Equity business consists of: (a) our global private equity funds (Blackstone Capital Partners or “BCP”), (b) our Asia-focused private equity funds (Blackstone Capital Partners Asia or “BCP Asia”), (c) our sector-focused funds, including our energy- and energy transition-focused funds (Blackstone Energy Transition Partners or “BETP”) and (d) our core private equity funds (Blackstone Core Equity Partners or “BCEP”). \n \nWe are a global leader in private equity investing. Our Corporate Private Equity business pursues transactions across industries on a global basis. It strives to create value by investing in great businesses where our capital, strategic insight, global relationships and operational support can drive transformation. Corporate Private Equity’s investment strategies and core themes continually evolve in anticipation of, or in response to, changes in the global economy, local markets, regulation, capital flows and geopolitical trends. We seek to construct a \n\n\n \n \n72 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndifferentiated portfolio of investments with a well-defined, post-acquisition value creation strategy. Similarly, we seek investments that can generate strong unlevered returns regardless of entry or exit cycle timing. BCEP pursues control-oriented investments in high-quality companies with durable businesses and seeks to offer a lower level of risk and a longer hold period than traditional private equity. \n \nTactical Opportunities pursues a thematically driven, opportunistic investment strategy. Our flexible, global mandate enables us to find differentiated opportunities across asset classes, industries and geographies and invest behind them with the frequent use of structure to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Tactical Opportunities’ ability to dynamically shift focus to the most compelling opportunities in any market environment, combined with the business’ expertise in structuring complex transactions, enables Tactical Opportunities to invest in attractive market areas, often with securities that provide downside protection and maintain upside return. \n \nBXLS invests across the life cycle of companies and products within the life sciences sector. BXLS primarily focuses on investments in life sciences products in late-stage clinical development within the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical technology sectors. \n \nBXG seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in dynamic, growth-stage businesses, with a focus on the consumer, consumer technology, enterprise solutions, financial services and healthcare sectors. \n \nBXPE invests primarily in privately negotiated, equity-oriented investments, leveraging Blackstone’s private equity talent and investment capabilities to create an attractive portfolio of alternative investments diversified across geographies and sectors. \n \nBIP targets a diversified mix of core+, core and public-private partnership investments across all infrastructure sectors, including energy infrastructure, transportation, digital infrastructure and water and waste. BIP applies a disciplined, operationally intensive investment approach to investments, seeking to apply a long-term \nbuy-and-hold\n strategy to large-scale infrastructure assets with a focus on delivering stable, long-term capital appreciation together with a predictable annual cash flow yield. BXINFRA invests primarily in infrastructure equity, secondaries and credit strategies, leveraging Blackstone’s infrastructure talent and investment capabilities to create an attractive portfolio of alternative infrastructure investments. \n \nStrategic Partners is a total fund solutions provider. As a secondary investor, it acquires interests in high-quality private funds from original holders seeking liquidity. Strategic Partners focuses on a range of opportunities in underlying funds such as private equity, real estate, infrastructure, venture and growth capital, credit and other types of funds, as well as general \npartner-led\n transactions and primary investments and \nco-investments\n with financial sponsors. Strategic Partners also provides investment advisory services to separately managed account clients investing in primary and secondary investments in private funds and \nco-investments.\n Blackstone GP Stakes targets minority investments in the general partners of private equity and other private market alternative asset management firms globally, with a focus on delivering a combination of recurring annual cash flow yield and long-term capital appreciation. \n \nCredit & Insurance \n \nOur Credit & Insurance segment (“BXCI”) offers its clients and borrowers a comprehensive solution across corporate and asset based credit, including investment grade and \nnon-investment\n grade. BXCI is one of the largest credit managers and CLO managers in the world. The investment portfolios BXCI’s credit platform manages or \nsub-advises\n consist primarily of loans and securities of \nnon-investment\n and investment grade companies spread across the capital structure including senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred stock and common equity. \n \nBXCI is organized into three overarching credit investing strategies: private corporate credit, liquid corporate credit and infrastructure and asset based credit. The private corporate credit strategies include mezzanine and direct lending funds, private placement strategies, stressed/distressed strategies and SMAs. The direct lending funds include Blackstone Private Credit Fund (“BCRED”), Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (“BXSL”), both of which are business development companies (“BDCs”), as well as Blackstone European Private Credit Fund (“ECRED”). \n \n \n\n\n \n \n73 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe liquid corporate credit strategies consist of CLOs, closed-ended funds, open-ended funds, systematic strategies and SMAs. The infrastructure and asset based credit strategies include energy strategies (including our sustainable resources platform) and asset based finance strategies focused on privately originated, income-oriented credit assets secured by physical, financial or residential real estate collateral. \n \nOur insurance platform focuses on providing full investment management services for insurance and reinsurance accounts, seeking to deliver customized and diversified portfolios consisting primarily of investment grade credit, including through Blackstone’s private credit origination capabilities. Through this platform, we provide our clients tailored portfolio construction, strategic asset allocation and specialized analytical tools. While focusing on policyholder protection, we seek to achieve risk-managed, liability-matched and capital-efficient returns, as well as diversification and capital preservation. We also provide similar services to clients through SMAs or by \nsub-managing\n assets for certain insurance-dedicated funds and special purpose vehicles. \n \nMulti-Asset Investing \n \nOur Multi-Asset Investing segment (“BXMA”) is the world’s largest discretionary allocator to hedge funds and seeks to grow investors’ assets through investment strategies designed to deliver, primarily through the public markets, compelling risk-adjusted returns. \n \nBXMA is organized into four investment platforms: Absolute Return, Multi-Strategy, Total Portfolio Management and Public Real Assets. Absolute Return manages a broad range of commingled and customized portfolios and aims to generate consistent returns across market environments. Multi-Strategy aims to generate strong risk-adjusted returns through opportunistic, asset-class agnostic investing. Total Portfolio Management manages large-scale total portfolios across asset classes in both public and private markets. The Public Real Assets platform is managed by Harvest Fund Advisors LLC (“Harvest”), which primarily invests in publicly traded energy infrastructure, renewables and master limited partnerships holding midstream energy assets in North America. \n \nBusiness Environment \n \nBlackstone’s businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, Asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world. \n \nMost major equity markets appreciated in the third quarter of 2025, driven by positive economic data, accommodative central bank actions, and growing optimism over easing trade tensions. The S&P 500 Index delivered a total return of 8.1%, led by the information technology and telecommunications sectors, which gained 13.2% and 12.0%, respectively. The consumer staples sector, however, was the worst performing sector, declining 2.4%. Equity market volatility declined, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declining 2.7% from the second quarter of 2025. In credit markets, the S&P Leveraged Loan Index generated a total return of 1.8% and the ICE Bank of America High Yield Bond Index returned 2.4%. High yield spreads tightened by 23 basis points, while \nyear-to-date\n issuance increased 9.6% year-over-year. \n \nThe U.S. federal government shutdown effective October 1, 2025 has resulted in the unavailability of certain economic data for the third quarter of 2025, including GDP, labor market and personal consumption expenditures index data. Among the available data, the September Consumer Price Index was up 3.0% year-over-year and 0.3% from August, putting annual inflation at a rate of 3.0%. Although this represents a significant moderation of inflation compared to recent years, the overall rate has remained steadily above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2.0%. The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target range by 25 basis points in September 2025, followed by an additional 25 basis points to \n3.75-4.00%\n subsequent to quarter end in October 2025, the lowest level in three years. The \nten-year\n U.S. Treasury yield decreased 8 basis points in the quarter to 4.15% and further declined following quarter end to 4.08% as of October 31, 2025. Three-month SOFR decreased 21 basis points in the quarter to 4.24%. \n\n\n \n \n74 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital markets activity levels in the U.S. expanded dramatically in the third quarter of 2025, with U.S. initial public oﬀering volumes and announced merger and acquisition deal volumes up approximately 100% and 64% year-over-year, respectively. \n \nOutside of the U.S., most major central banks maintained their monetary policies. The Bank of England lowered its bank rate by 25 basis points in August 2025 to 4.00% but left the rate unchanged in September 2025. Inflation in the U.K. increased slightly to 3.8% year-over-year in September 2025 compared to 3.6% in June 2025. The European Central Bank held its deposit facility rate steady in the quarter at 2.0%. Eurozone inflation increased slightly to 2.2% year-over-year in September 2025, compared to 2.0% in June 2025. The Bank of Japan also left its policy rate unchanged in the quarter at 0.50%. \n \nOverall, despite the limited availability of data regarding the condition of the U.S. economy, resiliency in recent quarters and declines in interest rates have contributed to improved investor sentiment, stronger capital markets and increased transaction activity in the quarter. \n \nFor additional information on the potential impact on each of our business segments of the conditions described above see “—Segment Analysis.” \n \nNotable Transactions \n \nOn October 16, 2025, Blackstone entered into an amended and restated $4.325 billion revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility amends and restates Blackstone’s existing revolving credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date from December 15, 2028 to October 16, 2030 and increase the aggregate required minimum amount of fee generating assets under management. For additional information see Note 11. “Borrowings” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “— Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” \n \nOn November 3, 2025, Blackstone, through its subsidiary Blackstone Reg Finance Co. L.L.C., issued $600 million aggregate principal amount 4.300% senior notes due November 3, 2030 (the “Registered 2030 Notes”), and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.950% senior notes due February 15, 2036 (the “Registered 2036 Notes”) and, together with the Registered 2030 Notes, (the “Registered Notes”), pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form \nS-3.\n Blackstone intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Registered Notes for general corporate purposes. For additional information see Note 11. “Borrowings” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “— Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources —Sources and Uses of Liquidity.” \n\n\n \n \n75 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizational Structure \n \nThe simplified diagram below depicts our current organizational structure. The diagram does not depict all of our subsidiaries, including intermediate holding companies through which certain of the subsidiaries depicted are held. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \nKey Financial Measures and Indicators \n \nWe manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). See “—Item 1. Financial Statements — Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and “—Critical Accounting Policies.” Our key \nnon-GAAP\n financial measures and operating indicators and metrics are discussed below. \n \nDistributable Earnings \n \nDistributable Earnings is derived from Blackstone’s segment reported results. Distributable Earnings is used to assess performance and amounts available for dividends to Blackstone stockholders, including Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships. Distributable Earnings is the sum of Segment Distributable Earnings plus Net Interest and Dividend Income (Loss) less Taxes and Related Payables. Distributable Earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See \n“—Non-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Distributable Earnings. \n\n\n \n \n76 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Interest and Dividend Income (Loss) is presented on a segment basis and is equal to Interest and Dividend Revenue less Interest Expense, adjusted for the impact of consolidation of Blackstone Funds, and interest expense associated with the tax receivable agreement. \n \nTaxes and Related Payables represent the total GAAP tax provision adjusted to include only the current tax provision (benefit) calculated on Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes and including the payable under the tax receivable agreement. Further, the current tax provision utilized when calculating Taxes and Related Payables and Distributable Earnings reflects the benefit of deductions available to the company on certain expense items that are excluded from the underlying calculation of Segment Distributable Earnings and Total Segment Distributable Earnings, such as equity-based compensation charges and certain Transaction-Related and \nNon-Recurring\n Items where there is a current tax provision or benefit. The economic assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied income tax provision are the same as those methodologies and assumptions used in calculating the current income tax provision for Blackstone’s Consolidated Statements of Operations under GAAP, excluding the impact of divestitures and accrued tax contingency related liabilities or refunds which are reflected when paid or received. The Payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement reflects the expected amount of tax savings generated in the period that parties to the Tax Receivable Agreement are entitled to receive in future periods. Management believes that including the amount payable under the tax receivable agreement and utilizing the current income tax provision adjusted as described above when calculating Distributable Earnings is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods and more accurately reflects earnings that are available for distribution to stockholders. \n \nSegment Distributable Earnings \n \nSegment Distributable Earnings is Blackstone’s segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across Blackstone’s four segments. Blackstone believes it is useful to stockholders to review the measure that management uses in assessing segment performance. Segment Distributable Earnings represents the net realized earnings of Blackstone’s segments and is the sum of Fee Related Earnings and Net Realizations for each segment. Blackstone’s segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates Blackstone Funds, eliminates \nnon-controlling\n ownership interests in Blackstone’s consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes Transaction-Related and \nNon-Recurring\n Items. Transaction-Related and \nNon-Recurring\n Items arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone’s initial public offering and \nnon-recurring\n gains, losses, or other charges, if any. They consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the tax receivable agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs, gains or losses associated with these corporate actions and \nnon-recurring\n gains, losses or other charges that affect \nperiod-to-period\n comparability and are not reflective of Blackstone’s operational performance. Segment Distributable Earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See \n“—Non-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Segment Distributable Earnings. \n \nNet Realizations is presented on a segment basis and is the sum of Realized Principal Investment Income and Realized Performance Revenues (which refers to Realized Performance Revenues excluding Fee Related Performance Revenues), less Realized Performance Compensation (which refers to Realized Performance Compensation excluding Fee Related Performance Compensation and Equity-Based Performance Compensation). \n \nRealized Performance Compensation reflects an increase, pursuant to a separate compensation program, in the aggregate Realized Performance Compensation paid to certain of our professionals above the amounts allocable to them based upon the percentage participation in the relevant performance plans previously awarded to them. The expectation is that for the full year 2025, Fee Related Compensation will be decreased by the total amount of additional Performance Compensation awarded for the year in respect of this compensation program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, Realized Performance Compensation increased by \n\n\n \n \n77 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$31.1 million and $78.2 million, respectively, and Fee Related Compensation decreased by $13.2 million and $60.0 million, respectively. These changes to Realized Performance Compensation and Fee Related Compensation reduced Net Realizations, increased Fee Related Earnings and had a negative impact to Income Before Provision for Taxes and Distributable Earnings in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. These changes are not expected to impact Income Before Provision for Taxes and Distributable Earnings for the year ending December 31, 2025. These changes had an impact on individual quarters in 2024, but did not impact Income Before Provision for Taxes and Distributable Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. \n \nFee Related Earnings \n \nFee Related Earnings is a performance measure used to assess Blackstone’s ability to generate profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not subject to future realization events. Blackstone believes Fee Related Earnings is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the profitability of the portion of Blackstone’s business that is not dependent on realization activity. Fee Related Earnings equals management and advisory fees (net of management fee reductions and offsets) plus Fee Related Performance Revenues, less (a) Fee Related Compensation on a segment basis and (b) Other Operating Expenses. Fee Related Earnings is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See \n“—Non-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Fee Related Earnings. \n \nFee Related Compensation is presented on a segment basis and refers to the compensation expense, excluding Equity-Based Compensation, directly related to (a) Management and Advisory Fees, Net and (b) Fee Related Performance Revenues, referred to as Fee Related Performance Compensation. \n \nFee Related Performance Revenues refers to the realized portion of Performance Revenues from Perpetual Capital that are (a) measured and received on a recurring basis and (b) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments. \n \nOther Operating Expenses is presented on a segment basis and is equal to General, Administrative and Other Expenses, adjusted to (a) remove transaction-related and \nnon-recurring\n items that arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone’s initial public offering and \nnon-recurring\n gains, losses or other charges, if any, (b) remove certain expenses reimbursed by the Blackstone Funds which are netted against Management and Advisory Fees, Net in Blackstone’s segment presentation and (c) give effect to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. The administrative fee is accounted for as a capital contribution under GAAP, but is reflected as a reduction of Other Operating Expenses in Blackstone’s segment presentation. \n \nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization \n \nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), is a supplemental measure used to assess performance derived from Blackstone’s segment results and may be used to assess its ability to service its borrowings. Adjusted EBITDA represents Distributable Earnings plus the addition of (a) Interest Expense on a segment basis, (b) Taxes and Related Payables and (c) Depreciation and Amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See \n“—Non-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA. \n\n\n \n \n78 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Accrued Performance Revenues \n \nNet Accrued Performance Revenues is a \nnon-GAAP\n financial measure Blackstone believes is useful to stockholders as an indicator of potential future realized performance revenues based on the current investment portfolio of the funds and vehicles we manage. Net Accrued Performance Revenues represents the accrued performance revenues receivable by Blackstone, net of the related accrued performance compensation payable by Blackstone, excluding performance revenues that have been realized but not yet distributed as of the reporting date and clawback amounts, if any. Net Accrued Performance Revenues is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Investments. See \n“—Non-GAAP\n Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Net Accrued Performance Revenues and Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Equity Method Investments” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” for additional information on the calculation of Investments — Accrued Performance Allocations. \n \nOperating Metrics \n \nThe alternative asset management business is primarily based on managing third-party capital and does not require substantial capital investment to support rapid growth. Since our inception, we have developed and used various key operating metrics to assess and monitor the operating performance of our various alternative asset management businesses in order to monitor the effectiveness of our value-creating strategies. \n \nTotal and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management \n \n“Total Assets Under Management” refers to the invested and available capital in Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles (including, without limitation, investment funds and SMAs). The Total Assets Under Management attributable to an individual vehicle is dependent on the structure and investment strategy of such vehicle and accordingly, will vary from vehicle to vehicle. Total Assets Under Management generally equals the sum of the following across Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles, as applicable: \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(a)\n\n\n \na vehicle’s invested capital at fair value which, as applicable, is measured as (1) total investments measured at fair value, or gross asset values, each of which may include the fair value of investments purchased with leverage under certain credit facilities, (2) net asset value, or (3) amount of debt and equity outstanding or aggregate par amount of assets, including principal cash for CLOs, and \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(b)\n\n\n \na vehicle’s available capital, if any, which represents (1) uncalled commitments made by investors and (2) available borrowing capacity under certain credit facilities. \n \nUncalled commitments represent the capital we are entitled to call from investors pursuant to the terms of their respective capital commitments, including capital commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods. Drawdown funds, perpetual capital vehicles, \nco-investment\n vehicles, and SMAs can each be structured with a commitment from an investor that is called over time as opposed to fully funded upon subscription. \n \nAssets may be raised in one vehicle or business unit and subsequently invested in or managed or advised by another vehicle or business unit. Total Assets Under Management are reported in the segment where the assets are managed. \n \nOur measurement of Total Assets Under Management includes commitments to, and the fair value of, invested capital in our funds from Blackstone and our personnel. Our calculation of Total Assets Under Management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of Total Assets Under Management differs from the manner in which affiliated investment advisors report regulatory assets under management and may differ from the definition set forth in the agreements governing the vehicles we manage or advise. \n\n\n \n \n79 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Fee-Earning\n Assets Under Management” refers to the portion of Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn management fees and/or performance revenues. The \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management attributable to an individual vehicle is driven by the basis on which fees are earned and accordingly, will vary from vehicle to vehicle. \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management generally equals the sum of the following across Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles, as applicable: (a) net asset value, (b) committed capital and remaining invested capital during the investment period and post-investment period, respectively, (c) invested capital (including leverage to the extent management \nfee-eligible),\n (d) gross asset value, (e) fair value of investments, or (f) the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of CLOs. \n \nAssets may be raised in one vehicle or business unit and subsequently invested in or managed or advised by another vehicle or business unit. \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management are reported in the segment where the Total Assets Under Management are reported to the extent \nfee-paying\n to Blackstone. \n \nWhile \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management generally reflects Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn management fees, \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management may also include Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn only performance revenues. Our calculation of \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management may differ from the definition set forth in the agreements governing the vehicles that we manage or advise. \n \nCommitment-based drawdown structured funds generally do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. Certain of our open-ended vehicles generally afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually, quarterly or monthly), typically with 2 to 95 days’ notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. In our perpetual capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, redemption requests are required to be fulfilled only (a) in Blackstone’s or the vehicles’ board’s discretion, as applicable, (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital, or (c) where such required redemptions are limited in quantum, such as interval funds or in certain insurance-dedicated vehicles. Investment advisory agreements related to certain SMAs in our Credit & Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing segments, excluding SMAs in our insurance platform, may generally be terminated by an investor on 15 to 95 days’ notice. SMAs in our insurance platform can generally only be terminated for long-term underperformance, cause and certain other limited circumstances, in each case subject to Blackstone’s right to cure. \n \nPerpetual Capital \n \n“Perpetual Capital” refers to the component of assets under management with an indefinite term, that is not in liquidation, and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows or where required redemptions are limited in quantum. Perpetual Capital includes \nco-investment\n capital with an investor right to convert into Perpetual Capital. \n \nIn our Perpetual Capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, redemption requests are required to be fulfilled only (a) in Blackstone’s or the vehicles’ board’s discretion, as applicable, (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital, or (c) where such required redemptions are limited in quantum, such as interval funds or in certain insurance-dedicated vehicles. Perpetual Capital includes \nco-investment\n capital with an investor right to convert into Perpetual Capital. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it represents capital we manage that has a longer duration and the ability to generate recurring revenues in a different manner than traditional fund structures. \n \nDry Powder \n \nDry Powder represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment, including general partner and employee capital, and is an indicator of the capital we have available for future investments. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the extent to which capital is available for Blackstone to deploy capital into investment opportunities as they arise. \n\n\n \n \n80 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management \n \nInvested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management represents invested capital at fair value on which performance revenues could be earned if certain hurdles are met. We believe Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the capital deployed that has the potential to generate performance revenues. \n \nRecent Tax Developments \n \nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was signed into law. The OBBBA provides for significant U.S. tax law changes including making permanent key elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including 100% bonus depreciation, domestic research cost expensing, and the business interest expense limitation. Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, these provisions were set to sunset on December 31, 2025. Blackstone does not believe the extension of these provisions, or other provisions contained in the OBBBA, will materially impact its financial statements. For further discussion of potential consequences of changes in tax regulations, please see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Changes in U.S. and foreign taxation of businesses and other tax laws, regulations or treaties or an adverse interpretation of these items by tax authorities could adversely affect us, including by adversely impacting our effective tax rate and tax liability.” in our Annual Report on \nForm 10-K\n for the year ended December 31, 2024. \n \nOn July 29, 2025, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued guidance which provides for a simplified approach to the calculation of the corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”). Based on the available guidance, Blackstone does not believe CAMT will materially impact its Provision for Taxes. \n \nConsolidated Results of Operations \n \nFollowing is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of our four business segments (which are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the investment funds, eliminates \nnon-controlling\n ownership interests in Blackstone’s consolidated operating partnerships and removes the amortization of intangible assets and Transaction-Related and \nNon-Recurring\n Items) in

the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in Revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease of $967.6 million in Investment Income (Loss). The decrease in Investment Income (Loss) was primarily attributable to a decrease of $1.6 billion in Unrealized Investment Income, partially offset by increases of $640.0 million in Realized Investment Income and $261.4 million in Management and Advisory Fees, Net. \n \nThe $1.6 billion decrease in Unrealized Investment Income was primarily attributable to net unrealized depreciation of investments in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to net unrealized appreciation of investments the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The increase in our Private Equity segment was primarily attributable to increased deal activity in BXCM, fee holiday expirations of BCP IX and BETP IV and an increase in \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in BXPE and BIP. \n \nExpenses \n \nExpenses were $1.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $145.4 million, compared to $1.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $209.6 million in Total Compensation and Benefits, of which $311.6 million was a decrease in Performance Allocations Compensation, partially offset by an increase of $113.6 million in Compensation. The decrease in Performance Allocations Compensation was primarily attributable to the decrease in Investment Income (Loss), on which a portion of Performance Allocations Compensation is based. The increase in Compensation was primarily attributable to the increase in Management and Advisory Fees, Net, on which a portion of Compensation is based. \n \nOther Income \n \nOther Income was $108.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $65.8 million, compared to $42.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Other Income was attributable to an increase of $65.8 million in Net Gains from Fund Investment Activities. \n \nThe increase in Net Gains from Fund Investment Activities was primarily attributable to an increase of $42.5 million in our Real Estate segment, which was primarily attributable to net unrealized appreciation of investments in our consolidated funds in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to net unrealized depreciation of investments in our consolidated funds in the three months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n\n \n \n83 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 \n \nRevenues \n \nRevenues were $10.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $57.4 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in Revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease of $527.2 million in Investment Income (Loss). The decrease in Investment Income (Loss) was primarily attributable to a decrease of $1.5 billion in Unrealized Investment Income, partially offset by increases of $977.7 million in Realized Investment Income and $686.7 million in Management and Advisory Fees, Net. \n \nThe $1.5 billion decrease in Unrealized Investment Income was primarily attributable to lower unrealized gains in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The principal drivers were: \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nA decrease of $689.5 million in our Credit & Insurance segment primarily attributable to lower unrealized appreciation of Corebridge common stock and investments in certain private corporate credit funds in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nA decrease of $658.8 million in our Private Equity segment primarily attributable to lower unrealized appreciation of investments in certain Corporate Private Equity funds in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Corporate Private Equity funds appreciated 8.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 11.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n \nThe $977.7 million increase in Realized Investment Income was primarily attributable to higher realized gains in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The principal drivers were: \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nAn increase of $654.0 million in our Private Equity segment primarily attributable to crystallization of performance revenues for BXPE and BIP, as well as realizations in Secondaries, related to the sale of an interest in the GP Stakes portfolio, and Tactical Opportunities. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nAn increase of $207.4 million in our Credit & Insurance segment primarily attributable to realizations in private corporate credit. \n \nThe $686.7 million increase in Management and Advisory Fees, Net was primarily attributable to an increase in our Private Equity segment of $476.6 million. The increase in our Private Equity segment was primarily attributable to increased deal activity in BXCM, an increase in Base Management Fees due to fee holiday expirations of BCP IX and BETP IV and an increase in \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in BXPE and BIP. \n \nExpenses \n \nExpenses were $5.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $258.5 million, compared to $5.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $129.3 million in Total Compensation and Benefits, of which $451.9 million was an increase in Compensation, partially offset by a decrease of $284.6 million in Performance Allocations Compensation. The increase in Compensation was primarily attributable to the increase in Management and Advisory Fees, Net, on which a portion of Compensation is based. The decrease in Performance Allocations Compensation was primarily attributable to the decrease in Investment Income (Loss), on which a portion of Performance Allocations Compensation is based. \n\n\n \n \n84 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Income \n \nOther Income was $302.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $232.5 million, compared to $70.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Other Income was attributable to an increase of $232.5 million in Net Gains from Fund Investment Activities. \n \nThe increase in Net Gains from Fund Investment Activities was primarily attributable to increases of $135.3 million in our Real Estate segment and $63.8 million in our Private Equity segment. The increase in our Real Estate segment was primarily attributable to net unrealized appreciation of investments in our consolidated funds in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to net unrealized depreciation of investments in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increases in our Private Equity segment were primarily attributable to higher net unrealized appreciation of investments in our consolidated funds in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n \nProvision for Taxes \n \nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 \n \nBlackstone’s Provision for Taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $209.7 million, a decrease of $35.6 million, compared to $245.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 14.5% and 13.6%, based on our Income Before Provision for Taxes of $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. \n \nThe increase in Blackstone’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, relates primarily to the impact of \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities and the deferred tax impact of Blackstone’s investment in its operating partnerships. \n \nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 \n \nBlackstone’s Provision for Taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $743.0 million, a decrease of $46.2 million, compared to $789.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 15.4% and 16.1%, based on our Income Before Provision for Taxes of $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. \n \nThe decrease in Blackstone’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, relates primarily to the impact of \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities and the deferred tax impact of Blackstone’s investment in its operating partnerships. \n \nAdditional information regarding our income taxes can be found in Note 12. “Income Taxes” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing. \n \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities \n \nThe Net Income Attributable to Redeemable \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities and Net Income Attributable to \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities is attributable to the consolidated Blackstone Funds. The amounts of these items vary directly with the performance of the consolidated Blackstone funds and largely eliminate the amount of Other Income (Loss) – Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities from the Net Income Attributable to Blackstone Inc. \n \nNet Income Attributable to \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Blackstone Holdings is derived from the Income Before Provision for Taxes at the Blackstone Holdings level, excluding the Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities and the percentage allocation of the income between Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of Blackstone Holdings and Blackstone after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income such as fees allocable to Blackstone. \n\n\n \n \n85 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Net Income Before Taxes allocated to Blackstone personnel and other limited partners of Blackstone Holdings was 37.5% and 38.4%, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Net Income Before Taxes allocated to Blackstone personnel and other limited partners of Blackstone Holdings was 37.7% and 38.6%, respectively. The respective decreases of 0.9% and 0.9% were primarily attributable to the conversion of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units to shares of common stock and the vesting of shares of common stock. \n \nOperating Metrics \n \nTotal and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management \n \nThe following graphs and tables summarize the \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management by Segment and Total Assets Under Management by Segment, followed by a rollforward of activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.

September 30, 2024 \n \nSegment Distributable Earnings were $618.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $78.0 million, compared to $540.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to an increase of $49.2 million in Fee Related Earnings and an increase of $28.8 million in Net Realizations. \n \nThe performance of funds in our Real Estate segment was stable overall in the third quarter of 2025. Continued momentum in digital infrastructure and multifamily investments supported appreciation, despite some offsetting weakness of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. \n \nWe believe values in our Real Estate equity portfolio will continue to benefit from healthy cash flow growth, declining new supply and further improvement in the cost and availability of debt. More favorable capital markets, along with improving investor sentiment, are also supporting an environment that is more conducive to transaction activity. While we expect the market for larger realizations to remain muted in the near-term, we believe this environment, if sustained, should provide a strong foundation for acceleration in transaction activity. \n \nFee Related Earnings \n \nFee Related Earnings were $549.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $49.2 million, compared to $500.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of $52.2 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues. \n\n\n \n \n108 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFee Related Performance Revenues were $124.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $52.2 million, compared to $72.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to higher Fee Related Performance Revenues in BREIT. \n \nNet Realizations \n \nNet Realizations were $68.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $28.8 million, compared to $39.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Net Realizations was primarily attributable to an increase of $54.8 million in Realized Performance Revenues, partially offset by an increase of $24.9 million in Realized Performance Compensation. \n \nRealized Performance Revenues were $132.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $54.8 million, compared to $78.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to higher Realized Performance Revenues in BREP. \n \nRealized Performance Compensation was $69.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $24.9 million, compared to $44.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in Realized Performance Revenues. \n \nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 \n \nSegment Distributable Earnings were $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $6.4 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to an increase of $10.3 million in Fee Related Earnings, partially offset by a decrease of $3.9 million in Net Realizations. \n \nFee Related Earnings \n \nFee Related Earnings were $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $10.3 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was attributable to an increase of $49.0 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues, offset by a decrease of $72.5 million in Management Fees, Net. \n \nFee Related Performance Revenues were $252.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $49.0 million, compared to $203.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to higher Fee Related Performance Revenues in BREIT. \n \nManagement Fees, Net were $2.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $72.5 million, compared to $2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to decreases in Base Management Fees and Transaction and Other Fees, Net. Base Management Fees decreased $43.7 million primarily attributable to a decrease in \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in BREDS and BREIT. Transaction and Other Fees, Net decreased $26.0 million primarily attributable to a decrease in acquisition advisory fees paid to the advisor of our BREP funds. \n \nNet Realizations \n \nNet Realizations were $101.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $3.9 million, compared to $105.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in Net Realizations was attributable to an increase of $10.6 million in Realized Performance Compensation and a decrease of $7.2 million in Realized Principal Investment Income, partially offset by an increase of $13.9 million in Realized Performance Revenues. \n\n\n \n \n109 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFund Returns \n \nFund return information is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

As of September 30, 2025, BREP VII, BREP VI, BREP V, BREP Europe IV, BREP Europe III and BREP Asia I were above their carried interest thresholds (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would have been above their carried interest thresholds even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. BREP IX, BREP VIII, BREDS IV and BREDS III were above their carried interest thresholds as of September 30, 2025, while BREP Asia II, BREP Europe VI, and BREP Europe V were below their carried interest thresholds. Funds are considered above their carried interest thresholds based on the aggregate fund position, although individual limited partners may be below their respective carried interest thresholds in certain funds. \n \nPrivate Equity \n \nThe following table presents the results of operations for our Private Equity segment: \n

Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 \n \nSegment Distributable Earnings were $871.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $447.6 million, compared to $423.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to an increase of $249.2 million in Net Realizations and an increase of $198.4 million in Fee Related Earnings. \n \nOur Private Equity segment generated positive performance across all strategies in the third quarter of 2025, with particular strength in our Infrastructure and Secondaries strategies. In Corporate Private Equity, our operating companies exhibited resilient performance with solid revenue growth and margin stability. A more favorable capital markets environment has begun to provide a foundation for acceleration in transaction activity, including initial public offerings. If sustained, this environment should contribute to a further increase in transaction activity, including realizations, in our Private Equity segment. \n \nFee Related Earnings \n \nFee Related Earnings were $491.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $198.4 million, compared to $293.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $164.6 million in Management and Advisory Fees, Net and $120.8 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues, partially offset by an increase of $62.9 million in Fee Related Compensation. \n \nManagement and Advisory Fees, Net were $717.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $164.6 million, compared to $552.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to increases in Base Management Fees and Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net. Base Management Fees increased $117.0 million primarily attributable to fee holiday expirations of BCP IX and BETP IV, as well as an increase in \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in BXPE and BIP. Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net increased $61.3 million primarily attributable to increased volume of deal activity in BXCM. \n \nFee Related Performance Revenues were $126.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $120.8 million, compared to $5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to crystallization of performance revenues in BXPE and BIP. \n \nFee Related Compensation was $231.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $62.9 million, compared to $169.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in Fee Related Performance Revenues and Management and Advisory Fees, Net both of which impact Fee Related Compensation. \n \nNet Realizations \n \nNet Realizations were $380.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $249.2 million, compared to $130.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

For purposes of calculating the blended return, vehicles or share classes that report in a foreign currency have been converted to U.S. dollars at the spot rate as of September 30, 2025.

For purposes of calculating the blended return, vehicles or share classes that report in a foreign currency have been converted to U.S. dollars at the spot rate as of September 30, 2025.

BCP V is comprised of two fund classes, the BCP V “main fund” and \nBCP V-AC\n fund. Within these fund classes, the general partner is subject to equalization such that (a) the general partner accrues carried interest when the respective carried interest for either fund class is positive and (b) the general partner realizes carried interest so long as clawback obligations, if any, for either of the respective fund classes are fully satisfied. BCP V, BCP VI, BCP VII, BCP VIII, BEP I, BEP II, BEP III, BCEP I and BCP Asia I were above their respective carried interest thresholds. Funds are considered above their carried interest thresholds based on the aggregate fund position, although individual limited partners may be below their respective carried interest thresholds in certain funds. \n \nTactical Opportunities has various funds with closed investment periods, including but not limited to: \nBTOF-POOL,\n \nBTOF-POOL\n II, and \nBTOF-POOL\n III, which are each above their carried interest thresholds based on aggregate fund position.

Months Ended September 30, 2024 \n \nSegment Distributable Earnings were $416.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $41.0 million, compared to $375.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to an increase of $42.8 million in Fee Related Earnings, partially offset by a decrease of $1.8 million in Net Realizations. \n \nOur Credit & Insurance segment demonstrated strong performance in the third quarter of 2025. While lower interest rates will likely reduce returns in our floating rate strategies, we believe we will continue to generate excess returns relative to liquid markets in our private credit strategies. Our Credit & Insurance segment funds’ holdings are predominantly in senior secured credit with significant equity subordination from institutional borrowers. While we would expect defaults to rise as the credit cycle progresses, we believe these structural advantages should position our Credit & Insurance segment well. \n \nWe also continue to see long-term structural shifts toward private credit in the lending market. This has contributed to robust momentum in our \nnon-investment\n grade strategies, investment grade private credit and perpetual capital strategies. In addition, opportunities for corporate and bank partnerships and a favorable capital markets environment should continue to support overall transaction activity, including deployment. Given the significant opportunities in the space, competition in the private credit markets has increased and is likely to increase further as a result of product innovation and customization by private credit managers. In addition, regulatory measures aimed at reducing burden on U.S. banks, such as less onerous bank regulatory capital requirements, may also increase competition. \n\n\n \n \n116 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFee Related Earnings \n \nFee Related Earnings were $367.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $42.8 million, compared to $324.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of $79.1 million in Management Fees, Net, partially offset by an increase of $36.8 million in Fee Related Compensation. \n \nManagement Fees, Net were $497.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $79.1 million, compared to $418.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to an increase in Base Management Fees. Base Management Fees increased $75.1 million, primarily attributable to inflows from \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in private corporate credit. \n \nFee Related Compensation was $218.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $36.8 million, compared to $181.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in Management Fees, Net, which impacts Fee Related Compensation. \n \nNet Realizations \n \nNet Realizations were $48.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $1.8 million, compared to $50.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in Net Realizations was attributable to an increase of $4.6 million in Realized Performance Compensation and a decrease of $2.8 million in Realized Performance Revenues, partially offset by an increase of $5.6 million in Realized Principal Investment Income. \n \nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 \n \nSegment Distributable Earnings were $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $300.5 million, compared to $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to increases of $150.9 million in Fee Related Earnings and $149.6 million in Net Realizations. \n \nFee Related Earnings \n \nFee Related Earnings were $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $150.9 million, compared to $893.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $236.8 million in Management Fees, Net and $68.0 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues, partially offset by an increase of $107.7 million in Fee Related Compensation. \n \nManagement Fees, Net were $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $236.8 million, compared to $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to an increase in Base Management Fees. Base Management Fees increased $244.1 million primarily attributable to an increase in \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in infrastructure and asset based credit. \n \nFee Related Performance Revenues were $587.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $68.0 million, compared to $519.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net investment income and \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in BCRED. \n \nFee Related Compensation was $640.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $107.7 million, compared to $532.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in Management Fees, Net and Fee Related Performance Revenues, both of which impact Fee Related Compensation. \n\n\n \n \n117 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Realizations \n \nNet Realizations were $270.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $149.6 million, compared to $121.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Net Realizations was primarily attributable to an increase of $112.2 million in Realized Principal Investment Income. \n \nRealized Principal Investment Income was $143.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $112.2 million, compared to $31.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to the sale of Bistro, a portfolio visualization software platform developed by Blackstone. \n \nComposite Returns \n \nComposite returns information is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

September 30, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 \n \nSegment Distributable Earnings were $79.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $18.2 million, compared to $61.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to increases of $15.1 million in Fee Related Earnings and $3.1 million in Net Realizations. \n \nNearly all the strategies in our Multi-Asset Investing segment exhibited positive performance in the third quarter of 2025. In particular, the Absolute Return Composite had its twenty-second consecutive quarter of positive performance, including across our equities, macro, quantitative, and credit strategies. This coincided with strong investor sentiment, with \nyear-to-date\n net inflows in the segment of over $5 billion, the highest in nearly 15 years. Market volatility decreased in the quarter and, as certain strategies in our Multi-Asset Investing segment are designed to capitalize on periods of market volatility, a sustained period of low volatility may make it more difficult for such strategies to generate strong returns. \n \nFee Related Earnings \n \nFee Related Earnings were $72.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $15.1 million, compared to $57.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of $18.1 million in Management Fees, Net. \n \nManagement Fees, Net were $138.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $18.1 million, compared to $120.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in Base Management Fees. Base Management Fees increased $18.1 million primarily attributable to an increase in \nFee-Earning\n Assets Under Management in Absolute Return. \n \nNet Realizations \n \nNet Realizations were $7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $3.1 million, compared to $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $7.6 million in Realized Performance Revenues, partially offset by an increase of $4.4 million in Realized Performance Compensation. \n \nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 \n \nSegment Distributable Earnings were $207.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $32.4 million, compared to $175.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to increases of $27.3 million in Fee Related Earnings and $5.1 million in Net Realizations. \n \nFee Related Earnings \n \nFee Related Earnings were $191.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $27.3 million, compared to $164.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of $38.7 million in Management Fees, Net. \n \nManagement Fees, Net were $392.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of $38.7 million, compared to $353.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to an increase in Base Management Fees.

The increase in Net Realizations was attributable to an increase of $19.4 million in Realized Principal Investment Income (Loss) and a decrease of $3.5 million in Realized Performance Compensation, partially offset by a decrease of $17.7 million in Realized Performance Revenues. \n \nComposite Returns \n \nComposite returns information is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

The Absolute Return Composite includes only BXMA-managed commingled and customized multi-manager funds and accounts and does not include BXMA’s liquid solutions, seeding, Multi-Strategy, Total Portfolio Management and Public Real Assets \n(non-discretionary)\n platforms, except for investments by Absolute Return funds directly into those platforms. BXMA-managed funds in liquidation and, in the case of net returns, \nnon-fee-paying\n assets are also excluded. The funds/accounts that comprise the Absolute Return Composite are not managed within a single fund or account and are managed with different mandates. There is no guarantee that BXMA would have made the same mix of investments in a stand-alone fund/account. The Absolute Return Composite is not an investible product and, as such, the performance of the Absolute Return Composite does not represent the performance of an actual fund or account.

Blackstone is not a capital or balance sheet intensive business and targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period. As a result, we require limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of our businesses. We draw primarily on the long-term committed or invested capital of investors in our investment vehicles to fund the investment requirements of the Blackstone Funds and use our own realizations and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, make commitments to our own funds, where our minimum general partner commitments are generally less than 5% of the limited partner commitments of a fund, and pay dividends to stockholders and distributions to holders of Holdings Units. \n \nFluctuations in our statement of financial condition result primarily from activities of the Blackstone Funds that are consolidated as well as business transactions, such as the issuance of senior notes. The majority economic ownership interests of such consolidated Blackstone funds are reflected as Redeemable \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities, and \nNon-Controlling\n Interests in Consolidated Entities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The consolidation of these Blackstone funds has no net effect on Blackstone’s Net Income or Equity. \n\n\n \n \n126 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, fluctuations in our statement of financial condition also include appreciation or depreciation in Blackstone investments in the \nnon-consolidated\n Blackstone funds, additional investments and redemptions of such interests in the \nnon-consolidated\n Blackstone funds and the collection of receivables related to management and advisory fees. \n \nTotal Assets were $46.6 billion as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $3.1 billion from December 31, 2024. The increase in Total Assets was primarily attributable to increases of $2.1 billion in total assets attributable to consolidated Blackstone funds and $1.3 billion in total assets attributable to consolidated operating partnerships. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe increase in total assets attributable to consolidated Blackstone funds was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.6 billion in Investments. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n○\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe increase in Investments was primarily attributable to purchases made by consolidated fund entities. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe increase in total assets attributable to consolidated operating partnerships was primarily attributable to increases of $458.6 million in Cash and Cash Equivalents and $414.4 million in Investments. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n○\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents was primarily attributable to ongoing operating activities, partially offset by the paydown of senior notes that matured and partial paydowns of the Revolving Credit Facility. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n○\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe increase in Investments was primarily attributable to appreciation in our Private Equity segment. \n \nTotal Liabilities were $25.2 billion as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $1.2 billion from December 31, 2024.

As of September 30, 2025, Blackstone had $2.4 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents, $262.6 million invested in Corporate Treasury Investments and $6.9 billion in Other Investments (which included $6.3 billion of liquid investments), against $11.8 billion in borrowings. Such borrowings included $550.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, which were repaid on November 5, 2025, and our outstanding senior notes. \n \nOn November 3, 2025, Blackstone, through its subsidiary Blackstone Reg Finance Co. L.L.C., issued $600 million aggregate principal amount 4.300% senior notes due November 3, 2030 (the “Registered 2030 Notes”), and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.950% senior notes due February 15, 2036 (the “Registered 2036 Notes” and, together with the Registered 2030 Notes, the “Registered Notes”), pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form \nS-3.\n Blackstone intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Registered Notes for general corporate purposes. For additional information see Note 11. “Borrowings” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in “— Item 1. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this filing and “— Notable Transactions.” \n\n\n \n \n127 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the cash we receive from our notes offerings and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and other borrowings, we expect to receive (a) cash generated from operating activities, (b) Performance Revenue realizations, and (c) realizations on the fund investments that we make. The amounts received from these three sources in particular may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the frequency and size of realization events or net returns experienced by our investment funds. Our available capital could be adversely affected if there are prolonged periods of few substantial realizations from our investment funds accompanied by substantial capital calls for new investments from those investment funds. Therefore, Blackstone’s commitments to our funds are taken into consideration when managing our overall liquidity and cash position. \n \nWe expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to (a) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses, which includes, without limitation, funding our general partner and \nco-investment\n commitments to our funds and warehousing investments for our funds, (b) provide capital for business expansion, (c) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, and other obligations as they arise, including servicing debts, (d) pay income taxes and (e) pay dividends to our stockholders, make distributions to the holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units and make repurchases under our share repurchase program.

Additionally, for some of the general partner commitments shown in the table above, we require our senior managing directors and certain other professionals to fund a portion of the commitment even though the ultimate obligation to fund the aggregate commitment is ours pursuant to the governing agreements of the respective funds. The amounts of the aggregate applicable general partner original and remaining commitment are shown in the table above.

Therefore, we have excluded the summarized financial information for the Obligor Group due to management’s belief that such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide material information to investors.

\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n \nWe lease our primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2043. Occupancy lease agreements, in addition to contractual rent payments, generally include additional payments for certain costs incurred by the landlord, such as building expenses and utilities. To the extent these are fixed or determinable they are included in the table above. The table above includes operating leases that are recognized as Operating Lease Liabilities, short-term leases that are not recorded as Operating Lease Liabilities and leases that have been signed but not yet commenced which are not recorded as Operating Lease Liabilities. The amounts in this table are presented net of contractual sublease commitments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n \nRepresents the principal amounts due on our senior notes and secured borrowings. For our senior notes, we assume no \npre-payments\n and the borrowings are held until their final maturity. For our secured borrowings, we project \npre-payments\n based on the performance of the underlying assets and principal may be paid down in full prior to their stated maturity. As of September 30, 2025, we had $550.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, which are presented as due in 2028, the contractual maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. \n\n\n \n \n134 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n \nRepresents interest to be paid over the maturity of our senior notes and secured borrowings. For our senior notes, we assume no \npre-payments\n and the borrowings are held until their final maturity. For our secured borrowings, we project \npre-payments\n based on the performance of the underlying assets with interest payments based on the estimated principal outstanding, inclusive of projected \npre-payments.\n These amounts include commitment fees for unutilized borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The $550.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility was repaid on November 5, 2025. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\n \nThese obligations represent commitments of the consolidated Blackstone funds to make capital contributions to investee funds and portfolio companies. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\n \nRepresents obligations by Blackstone’s corporate subsidiary to make payments under the tax receivable agreements to certain \nnon-controlling\n interest holders for the tax savings realized from the taxable purchases of their interests in connection with the reorganization at the time of Blackstone’s initial public offering (“IPO”) in 2007 and subsequent purchases. The obligation represents the amount of the payments currently expected to be made, which are dependent on the tax savings expected to be realized as determined annually without discounting for the timing of the payments. As required by GAAP, the amount of the obligation included in the condensed consolidated financial statements and shown in Note 15. “Related Party Transactions” (see “—Item 1. Financial Statements”) differs to reflect the net present value of the payments due to certain \nnon-controlling\n interest holders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\n \nBlackstone is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with gross unrecognized benefits of $309.3 million and interest of $111.4 million as of September 30, 2025; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\n \nThese obligations represent commitments by us to provide general partner capital funding to the Blackstone Funds, limited partner capital funding to other funds and Blackstone principal investment commitments. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category; however, a substantial amount of the capital commitments are expected to be called over the next three years. We expect to continue to make these general partner capital commitments as we raise additional amounts for our investment funds over time. \n \nGuarantees \n \nBlackstone and certain of its consolidated funds provide financial guarantees. The amounts and nature of these guarantees are described in Note 16. “Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies — Guarantees” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in\n “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing. \n \nIndemnifications \n \nIn many of its service contracts, Blackstone agrees to indemnify the third-party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the above contractual obligations table or recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2025. \n \nClawback Obligations \n \nPerformance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocations received to date with respect to a fund exceed the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. The amounts and nature of Blackstone’s clawback obligations are described in Note 16. “Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies — Contingent Obligations (Clawback)” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing. \n\n\n \n \n135 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare Repurchase Program \n \nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, Blackstone repurchased 0.2 million and 0.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $34.9 million and $93.7 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2025, the amount remaining available for repurchases under the program was $1.7 billion. \n \nOn July 16, 2024, Blackstone’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of common stock and Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. Under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date. \n \nDividends \n \nOur intention is to pay to holders of common stock a quarterly dividend representing approximately 85% of Blackstone Inc.’s share of Distributable Earnings, subject to adjustment by amounts determined by our board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and funds, to comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as \ntax-related\n payments, clawback obligations and dividends to stockholders for any ensuing quarter. The dividend amount could also be adjusted upward in any one quarter. \n \nFor Blackstone’s definition of Distributable Earnings, see “—Key Financial Measures and Indicators.” \n \nAll of the foregoing is subject to the qualification that the declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time, including, without limitation, to reduce such quarterly dividends or even to eliminate such dividends entirely. \n \nBecause the publicly traded entity and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreements, the amounts ultimately paid as dividends by Blackstone to common stockholders in respect of each fiscal year are generally expected to be less, on a per share or per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships to the Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships in respect of their Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. \n \nDividends are treated as qualified dividends to the extent of Blackstone’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, with any excess dividends treated as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s basis. \n\n\n \n \n136 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following graph shows fiscal quarterly and annual per common stockholder dividends for 2025 and 2024. Dividends are declared and paid in the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which they are earned. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWith respect to the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, we paid to stockholders of our common stock a dividend of $1.29 per share, aggregating to $3.25 per share of common stock in respect of the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2025. With respect to fiscal year 2024, we paid stockholders aggregate dividends of $3.95 per share. \n \nLeverage \n \nWe may, under certain circumstances, use leverage opportunistically and over time to create the most efficient capital structure for Blackstone and our stockholders. In addition to the borrowings from our notes issuances and our Revolving Credit Facility, we may use asset based financing arrangements, including but not limited to margin loans, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities sold, not yet purchased. Reverse repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to take advantage of opportunistic yields otherwise absent in the overnight markets and also to use the collateral received to cover securities sold, not yet purchased. Repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to opportunistically yield higher spreads on purchased securities. The balances held in these financial instruments fluctuate based on Blackstone’s liquidity needs, market conditions and investment risk profiles. \n\n\n \n \n137 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table presents information regarding financial instruments which are included in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition: \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nRepurchase\nAgreements\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\nSecurities\nSold, Not Yet\nPurchased\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n(Dollars in Millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nBalance, September 30, 2025\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n388.8\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nBalance, December 31, 2024\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAverage Daily Balance\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n93.6\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nMaximum Daily Balance\n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n   388.8\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n$\n\n\n      2.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \nCritical Accounting Policies \n \nWe prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective. Actual results may be affected negatively based on changing circumstances. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. For a description of our accounting policies, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing. \n \nPrinciples of Consolidation \n \nFor a description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Consolidation” and Note 8. “Variable Interest Entities” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” for detailed information on Blackstone’s involvement with VIEs. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. \n \nThe determination that Blackstone holds a controlling financial interest in a Blackstone Fund or investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. In our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position included in this filing, we present 100% of the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs along with a \nnon-controlling\n interest which represents the portion of the consolidated vehicle’s interests held by third parties. However, assets of our consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated VIE and are not available for general use by Blackstone. Further, the liabilities of our consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of Blackstone. In the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, we eliminate any management fees, Incentive Fees, or Performance Allocations received or accrued from consolidated VIEs as they are considered intercompany transactions. We recognize 100% of the consolidated VIE’s investment income (loss) and allocate the portion of that income (loss) attributable to third-party ownership to \nnon-controlling\n interests in arriving at Net Income Attributable to Blackstone Inc. \n\n\n \n \n138 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assessment of whether we consolidate a Blackstone Fund or investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. These judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with the VIE and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to: \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nDetermining whether our management fees, Incentive Fees or Performance Allocations represent variable interests – We make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. In making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third-party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the VIE. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nDetermining whether \nkick-out\n rights are substantive – We make judgments as to whether the third-party investors in a partnership entity have the ability to remove the general partner, the investment manager or its equivalent, or to dissolve (liquidate) the partnership entity, through a simple majority vote. This includes an evaluation of whether barriers to exercise these rights exist. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \nConcluding whether Blackstone has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE – As there is no explicit threshold in GAAP to define “potentially significant,” management must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met. \n \nRevenue Recognition \n \nFor a description of our accounting policy on revenue recognition, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Revenue Recognition” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements.” For an additional description of the nature of our revenue arrangements, including how management fees, Incentive Fees, and Performance Allocations are generated, please refer to “Part I. Item 1. Business — Fee Structure/Incentive Arrangements” in our Annual Report on \nForm 10-K\n for the year ended December 31, 2024. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of revenue recognition principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. \n \nManagement and Advisory Fees, Net\n — Blackstone earns base management fees from its customers at a fixed percentage of a calculation base. The range of management fee rates and the calculation base from which they are earned, generally, are as follows: \n \nFor vehicles within the Real Estate segment: \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \n0.35% to 1.50% of committed capital or invested capital during the investment period or subsequent to the investment period, respectively, or gross asset value, for certain drawdown vehicles and \nco-investment\n vehicles, \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \n0.40% to 1.25% of net asset value for other vehicles, including separately managed accounts, certain perpetual capital vehicles, drawdown vehicles, and \nco-investment\n vehicles, and \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1.50% of BXMT’s net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated “distributable earnings” (which is generally equal to its GAAP net income excluding certain \nnon-cash\n and other items), subject to certain adjustments. \n \nFor vehicles within the Private Equity segment: \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \n0.50% to 1.75% of committed capital during the investment period or invested capital or gross investment value subsequent to the investment period for drawdown vehicles and certain \nco-investment\n vehicles, \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \n0.50% to 1.75% of invested capital for certain separately managed accounts and \nco-investment\n vehicles, and \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \n0.75% to 1.25% of net asset value for perpetual capital vehicles. \n\n\n \n \n139 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor vehicles within the Credit & Insurance segment: \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \n0.20% to 1.25% of net asset value or fair value of investments for certain separately managed accounts and open-ended vehicles, \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \n0.35% to 1.25% of net asset value or gross asset value of our BDCs and certain registered investment companies, \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \n0.10% to 0.50% of the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, for CLO vehicles, and \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \n0.20% to 1.50% of invested capital for drawdown vehicles and certain separately managed accounts. \n \nFor vehicles within the Multi-Asset Investing segment: \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n\n\n \n\n\n \n0.20% to 1.50% of net asset value for all vehicles. \n \nManagement fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital are mechanical in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. Management fee calculations based on net asset value, gross asset value, or investment fair value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions. See “—Fair Value” below for further discussion of the judgment required for determining the fair value of the underlying investments. \n \nInvestment Income (Loss)\n — Performance Allocations are made to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. Blackstone has concluded that investments made alongside its limited partners in a partnership which entitle Blackstone to a Performance Allocation represent equity method investments that are not in the scope of the GAAP guidance on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers. Blackstone accounts for these arrangements under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, Blackstone’s share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is determined using a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. Under the HLBV method, at the end of each reporting period Blackstone calculates the accrued Performance Allocations that would be due to Blackstone for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Performance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocation received to date exceeds the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results. \n \nThe change in the fair value of the investments held by certain Blackstone Funds is a significant input into the accrued Performance Allocation calculation and accrual for potential repayment of previously received Performance Allocations. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. See “—Fair Value” below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments. \n \nFair Value \n \nBlackstone uses fair value throughout the reporting process. For a description of our accounting policies related to valuation, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Fair Value of Financial Instruments” and “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Investments, at Fair Value” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of fair value principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment. \n\n\n \n \n140 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fair value of the investments held by Blackstone Funds is the primary input to the calculation of certain of our management fees, Incentive Fees, Performance Allocations and the related Compensation we recognize. Generally, Blackstone Funds are accounted for in accordance with the GAAP guidance on investment companies, and under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment Companies, and reflect their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments, at fair value. In the absence of observable market prices, we utilize valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis and assumptions that we believe market participants would use to determine the fair value of the investments. For investments where little market activity exists management’s determination of fair value is based on the best information available in the circumstances, which may incorporate management’s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, and the consideration of a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for \nnon-performance\n and liquidity risks. \n \nBlackstone has also elected the fair value option for certain instruments it owns directly, including loans and receivables, investments in private debt securities and other proprietary investments. Blackstone is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value, including debt instruments, equity securities and freestanding derivatives. \n \nFair Value of Investments or Instruments That Are Publicly Traded \n \nSecurities that are publicly traded and for which a quoted market exists will be valued at the closing price of such securities in the principal market in which the security trades, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market on the valuation date. When a quoted price in an active market exists, no block discounts or control premiums are permitted regardless of the size of the public security held. In some cases, securities will include legal and contractual restrictions limiting their purchase and sale for a period of time. A discount to the publicly traded price may be appropriate in instances where a legal restriction is a characteristic of the security, such as may be required under SEC Rule 144. The amount of the discount, if taken, shall be determined based on the time period that must pass before the restricted security becomes unrestricted or otherwise available for sale. \n \nFair Value of Investments or Instruments That Are Not Publicly Traded \n \nInvestments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity or debt of operating companies or real estate properties. Our primary methodology for determining the fair values of such investments is generally the income approach which provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business, security, or property is expected to generate in the future. The most widely used methodology under the income approach is the discounted cash flow method which includes significant assumptions about the underlying investment’s projected net earnings or cash flows, discount rate, capitalization rate and exit multiple. Our secondary methodology, generally used to corroborate the results of the income approach, is typically the market approach. The most widely used methodology under the market approach relies upon valuations for comparable public companies, transactions, or assets, and includes making judgments about which companies, transactions, or assets are comparable. Depending on the facts and circumstances associated with the investment, different primary and secondary methodologies may be used including option value, contingent claims or scenario analysis, yield analysis, projected cash flow through maturity or expiration, discount to sale, probability weighted methods or recent round of financing. \n \nIn certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. \n\n\n \n \n141 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement Process on Fair Value \n \nDue to the importance of fair value throughout the condensed consolidated financial statements and the significant judgment required to be applied in arriving at those fair values, we have developed a process around valuation that incorporates several levels of approval and review from both internal and external sources. Investments held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles are valued on at least a quarterly basis by our internal valuation or asset management teams, which are independent from our investment teams. For investments held by vehicles managed by more than one business unit, Blackstone has developed a process designed to facilitate coordination and alignment, as appropriate, of the fair value of \nin-scope\n investments across business units. \n \nFor investments valued utilizing the income method and where Blackstone has information rights, we generally have a direct line of communication with each of the Companies’ and underlying assets’ finance teams and collect financial data used to support projections used in a discounted cash flow analysis. The valuation team then analyzes the data received and updates the valuation models reflecting any changes in the underlying cash flow projections, weighted-average cost of capital, exit multiple or capitalization rate, and any other valuation input relevant to economic conditions. \n \nThe results of all valuations of investments held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles are reviewed by the relevant business unit’s valuation \nsub-committee,\n which is comprised of key personnel from the business unit, typically the chief investment officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer (or their respective equivalents where applicable) and other senior managing directors in the business. To further corroborate results, each business unit also generally obtains either a positive assurance opinion or a range of value from an independent valuation party, at least annually for internally prepared valuations for investments that have been held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles for greater than a year and quarterly for certain investments. Our firmwide valuation committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer and comprised of senior members of our businesses and representatives from corporate functions, including legal and finance, reviews the valuation process for investments held by us and our investment vehicles, including the application of appropriate valuation standards on a consistent basis. Each quarter, the valuation process is also reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors, which is comprised of our \nnon-employee\n directors. \n \nIncome Tax \n \nFor a description of our accounting policy on taxes and additional information on taxes see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 12. “Income Taxes” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing. \n \nOur provision for income taxes is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. \n \nAdditionally, significant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including any valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. In evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that Blackstone uses to manage its business. To the extent any portion of the deferred tax assets are not considered to be more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. \n\n\n \n \n142 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevisions in estimates and/or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any. \n \nRecent Accounting Developments \n \nInformation regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on Blackstone, if any, can be found in Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing."
