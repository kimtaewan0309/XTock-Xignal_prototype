Across nearly our entire domestic footprint, we leverage DOCSIS 3.1 to offer up to gigabit-plus downstream broadband speeds to residential and business customers. We also deploy fiber-to-the-premises with symmetrical speed offerings ranging up to 10 gigabits per second to residential customers who request that service, subject to local construction constraints, and up to 100 gigabits per second to business customers. We offer domestic wireless services using an MVNO agreement that allows us to offer services using Verizon’s wireless network along with our existing network of Wi-Fi hotspots across our network.\nWe continue to evolve and enhance our domestic network capabilities. In connection with a multiyear network transformation plan, in 2022 we began rolling out downstream speeds of up to 2 gigabits per second to our residential customers, which are now available to approximately 50% of our HFC network footprint. In 2023, we began deploying in select markets DOCSIS 4.0, which enables us to deliver multigigabit symmetrical broadband speeds over our existing HFC network. Additionally, as part of our network evolution, our engineering teams have been virtualizing and automating many core network functions using various technologies to expand capacity, increase operating efficiency, and identify and fix network issues proactively before they affect our customers. Our investment in virtualizing the network helps maintain network reliability and operational efficiency regardless of whether we connect a residence using either fiber or our HFC network. We continue to extend our network’s reach to new homes and businesses within our existing service areas, as well as edging-out to new service areas to expand the number of homes and businesses passed, and a significant portion of new homes and businesses passed are connected with fiber. We also partner with local, state and federal agencies when possible to provide services to unserved and underserved communities leveraging governmental subsidies where available. \nThe components of our domestic network require periodic maintenance and replacement and are primarily located on owned and leased properties, and in locations under agreements with local public utilities and municipalities. We operate national and regional data centers with equipment that is used to provide our services, and we maintain network operations centers with equipment necessary to monitor and manage the status of our services and network.\nOur international services are offered leveraging third-party networks, as well as our own core fiber network for broadband and wireline voice services in the United Kingdom. The related operating plant and equipment used to provide our video and connectivity services include leased satellite system signal receiving, encoding and decoding devices, and owned and leased headends and distribution networks, including coaxial, fiber-optic cables and other related equipment. For a majority of international customers, our video platform is delivered via one-way digital satellite transmission that uses satellites leased from third parties for the distribution of television networks, augmented by a set-top box and two-way broadband connectivity. We offer broadband and wireline voice services in the United Kingdom and Italy using third-party networks. In many cases, the fee for us to access these networks is on regulated terms. The ranges of service levels and speeds we offer are dependent upon the capabilities and reach of these third-party networks. We offer wireless services in the United Kingdom using a combination of a third-party’s network and our own mobile core network.\nOur Connectivity & Platforms business engineering teams continue to focus on technology initiatives to develop and deploy next-generation media, content delivery, content aggregation and streaming platforms that support X1, Sky Q, NOW, Sky Stream, Sky Glass, Xumo and our cloud DVR technology. These platforms are based on our global technology platform and integrate linear television networks, owned and third-party DTC streaming services and other internet-based apps, and on demand programming into a unified experience with voice-activated remote control search and interactive features. We also continue to focus on leveraging our own cloud network services to deliver video and advanced search capabilities. Our Connectivity & Platforms business also pursues technology initiatives related to broadband and wireless services that leverage our global technology platform. We provide our customers with in-and-out-of-home Wi-Fi, the ability to manage their Wi-Fi network and connected home with our mobile apps and online portal, advanced security technology, and other features. \nProgramming\nTo offer video services, Residential Connectivity & Platforms licenses substantial amounts of linear television programming from third parties and from our Media segment. The fees associated with these distribution agreements are generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the television network programming and a per subscriber fee, although programming expenses for certain television networks are based on a fixed fee. Additionally, certain of our agreements include the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our on demand services, online portal, mobile apps, the Xumo Stream Box, and our NOW and NOW TV streaming services.\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n4\nTable of Contents\nThe programming on our Sky-branded entertainment television networks includes content licensed from third parties and from our Studios segment, including certain original content. Our most significant agreements for the licensing of film and television entertainment content include exclusive rights with Paramount, Warner Bros. and our Studios segment.\nOther Sources of Supply and Operations\nWe purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant amount of customer premise equipment, including wireless gateways and set-top boxes, network equipment, and services to provide our broadband and video services to residential and business customers. We also purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless devices. We use a limited number of vendors to provide customer billing for our residential and business customers.\nOur technical services groups perform various tasks, including installations, plant maintenance and upgrades to our domestic network, and servicing and upgrades of customer premise equipment. The service vehicles used by our technical services groups are primarily owned. Our customer service teams provide primarily 24/7 call-answering capability and other services, and also offer our services to residential and business customers.\nCompetition\nResidential Connectivity & Platforms\nBroadband\nWe compete with a number of companies, many with significant financial resources, that offer internet services, including:\n•\nwireline telecommunications companies \n•\nwireless telecommunications companies\n•\nmunicipal broadband networks and power companies\n•\nsatellite broadband providers\nCertain wireline telecommunications companies, such as AT&T, Frontier, Lumen and Verizon in the United States and BT and Virgin Media O2 in the United Kingdom, have built and are continuing to build fiber-based wireline network infrastructure further into their networks, which enables them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional copper digital subscriber line (“DSL”) technology, and are offering services with these higher speeds in many of our service areas. Certain companies that offer DSL service have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our broadband services. \nVarious wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of technologies, including 5G fixed wireless networks and 4G and 5G wireless broadband services. These networks work with devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and mobile and fixed wireless routers, as well as wireless data cards. \nOther companies and municipalities have launched fiber-based or newer satellite-based broadband technologies that provide services in certain areas in which we operate.\nDomestic broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state levels may result in other service providers deploying subsidized internet access within our footprint. The availability of these and other offerings could negatively impact the demand for our domestic broadband services.\nWireless\nWe compete with national and regional wireless service providers in the United States, including AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, and wireless service providers in the United Kingdom that offer wireless service on both a stand-alone basis and with other services as bundled offerings.\nVideo\nWe compete with a number of companies offering video services in the Connectivity & Platforms markets, including:\n•\nDTC streaming service providers and aggregators, including:\n◦\nsubscription-based services, such as Disney+ and Netflix, that offer online services that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming\n◦\nvirtual multichannel video providers, such as Hulu + Live TV and YouTube TV, that offer streamed linear television networks\n◦\nfree ad-supported television services\n5\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\n◦\ncompanies that offer streaming devices that access and integrate streaming content\n•\ndirect broadcast satellite (“DBS”) providers that transmit satellite signals to substantially all households in the Connectivity & Platforms markets to provide video programming and other information similar to our video services \n•\ncompanies that have built and continue to build fiber-based networks that provide video services similar to ours and provide bundled offerings that include wireless and/or broadband services\n•\nother providers that build and operate communications systems and services in the same areas that we serve, including traditional providers of linear television programming\n•\na broad array of other online content providers, such as social networking platforms and user-generated content providers\n•\nother companies, such as broadcast television stations, that provide multiple free-to-air networks\nSimilar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, our Sky-branded entertainment television networks compete for the distribution of our television network programming to third-party video service providers and for viewers’ attention and audience share.\nAdvertising\nWe compete for the sale of advertising with digital properties\n, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers and other online content providers, such as social networking platforms and user-generated content providers, as well as with t\nelevision networks and stations, \nand all other advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by declines in audience ratings and television viewership, difficulty in measuring fragmented audiences and the increasing number of entertainment\n choices available. Our advertising is sold to local, regional and national advertisers, and competition is affected by the market conditions in the specific geographic locations in which we operate. We also compete with companies offering technology, tools and other services to customers in the media industry.\nBusiness Services Connectivity\nBusiness Services Connectivity primarily competes with wireline telecommunications companies and wide area network managed service providers. Competition for our connectivity services for small business customers is generally similar to the Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment. We compete for the sale of enterprise solutions offerings primarily with wide area network managed service providers, cloud-based application service providers and other telecommunication carriers.\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nResults in our Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services, including in college and vacation markets in the United States, and by the timing of the European football seasons in our international markets, which generally result in negative impacts to net customer relationship additions/(losses) in the second quarter of each year.\nSimilar to seasonal and cyclical variations in our Media segment, advertising revenue is subject to cyclical patterns and changes in viewership levels, driven by timing of the winter holiday season, political campaigns, sports seasons and when programming is aired.\nContent & Experiences Business\nMedia Segment\nWe operate our Media segment as a combined television and streaming business, which primarily includes:\n•\nNBCUniversal’s national and regional cable networks\n•\nNBC and Telemundo broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations\n•\nPeacock DTC streaming service\n•\nInternational television networks, including Sky Sports networks in the United Kingdom and Italy\nWe distribute a wide variety of programming on our linear television networks and streaming services to appeal to consumers with varying preferences across demographics and geographic areas.\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n6\nTable of Contents\nR\nevenue is primarily generated from the sale of advertising and from the distribution of our television and streaming programming.\nWe sell advertising on our linear television networks, Peacock and other digital properties. Our advertising sales are affected by the prices we charge for each advertising unit, which are generally based on the size and demographics of our viewing audiences, audience ratings on our television networks, the number of advertising units we can place in our programming and on our digital properties, and our ability to sell advertising across our television and streaming business.\nWe receive fees from the d\nistribution of our television networks to traditional multichannel video providers, such as our Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment, and virtual multichannel video providers that offer streamed linear television networks. Our distribution agreements are generally multiyear, with revenue based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming on our television networks and a per subscriber fee, although revenue for certain of our television networks is based on a fixed fee. These fees include amounts for our owned television networks, including under NBC and Telemundo retransmission consent agreements, as well as associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. We also receive monthly retail or wholesale subscription fees for Peacock.\nWe also generate revenue from the licensing of our owned content and technology and from various digital properties. \nDomestic Cable Networks\nWe operate a diversified portfolio of cable networks operating predominantly in the United States.

The Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations include stations in all of the top 20 U.S. Hispanic markets and collectively reached approximately 71% of U.S. Hispanic television households as of December 31, 2024. In addition to broadcasting the Telemundo network’s national programming, local broadcast television stations deliver local news, weather, and investigative and consumer reporting. We also own an independent Telemundo station serving the Puerto Rico television market.\nPeacock\nPeacock is our DTC streaming service, featuring NBCUniversal and third-party content. Programming choices include exclusive Peacock originals, current NBC, Bravo and Telemundo shows, news, late-night comedy, live sports and a library of television shows and movies, as well as several live channels. The service is available on internet-connected devices and offered through two subscription-based tiers: an ad-supported tier and a tier featuring the same content ad-free, with certain limited exceptions.

In Europe, major sports rights, which are significant to our international networks, are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a 3 to 5 year period.\nStudios Segment\nOur Studios segment primarily includes our NBCUniversal and Sky film and television studio production and distribution operations. Our studio production facilities primarily include our owned Universal City location in Los Angeles, California and our leased studios in Atlanta, Georgia and in Elstree, United Kingdom. Revenue is generated primarily from the worldwide licensing of our owned film and television content and from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. We also generate revenue from the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products, as well as the production and licensing of live stage plays and the distribution of content produced by third parties.\nFilm Studios\nOur film studios develop, produce, acquire, market and distribute filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the following names:\n•\nUniversal Pictures\n•\nIllumination\n•\nDreamWorks Animation\n•\nFocus Features\n•\nWorking Title\nWe distribute the majority of our films initially for exhibition in movie theaters, while other films are initially distributed through licensing agreements. After their initial release, we distribute films globally to different customers over multiple licensing windows. We license films, including recent films and selections from our film library, which is comprised of more than 6,500 movies in a variety of genre\ns, to linear television networks and DTC streaming service providers, and to video on demand services provided by multichannel video providers. This includes licenses to our Media and Residential Connectivity & Platforms segments. Certain films are also licensed to our Media segment and made available for viewing on Peacock on the same date as the theatrical release.\n We also distribute films globally through the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products. Additionally, w\ne\n acquire distribution rights to films produced by third parties, which may be limited to particular geographic regions, specific forms of media or certain periods of time. Theatrical revenue is significantly affected by the timing of each release and the number of films we distribute, their acceptance by audiences, the number of exhibition screens, ticket prices, the percentage of ticket sales retention by the exhibitors and the popularity of competing films at the time our films are released. The success of a film in movie theaters is generally a significant factor in determining the revenue a film is likely to generate in succeeding licensing windows and through physical and digital home entertainment product sales.\nWe develop and produce films both alone and jointly with other studios or production companies. In certain cases, we have also entered into film co-financing arrangements with third party studios and non-studio entities to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic inter\nest in a film to an investor. Investors generally assume the full risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film.\nIn connection with film studio productions, we typically owe “residuals” payments to individuals hired under collective bargaining agreements, which are generally calculated based on post-theatrical or content licensing revenue. We also typically owe “participations” payments to creative talent, to third parties under co-financing agreements and to other parties involved in content production, which are generally based on the financial performance of the content.\n9\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nTelevision Studios\nOur television studios develop, produce and distribute original content, including scripted and unscripted television series. We also produce television content jointly as co-producers with third-party studios and production companies. Our television studios produce content primarily under the following names:\n•\nUniversal Television \n•\nUniversal Content Productions\n•\nUniversal Television Alternative Studio\n•\nUniversal International Studios\n•\nSky Studios\nOur original content is primarily initially licensed to linear television networks and DTC streaming service providers, including those in our Media and Residential Connectivity & Platforms segments. We also license content after its initial airing, license older television content from our television library, and distribute owned and acquired content globally through the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products. The production and distribution costs related to original broadcast television content generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial license, which means that obtaining additional licenses following the initial network license is critical to the content’s financial success. Similar to our film studio\ns, we typically owe residuals and participations payments in connection with television studio productions. \nTheme Parks Segment\nOur Theme Parks segment primarily includes the operations of the following Universal theme parks:\n•\nUniversal Orlando Resort\n: Includes two theme parks, Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure, and our water park, Volcano Bay, all of which are located in Orlando, Florida. Universal Orlando Resort also includes Universal CityWalk Orlando, a dining, retail and entertainment complex, and features on-site themed hotels in which we own a noncontrolling interest, and will include an additional theme park, Epic Universe, that is expected to open in May 2025.\n•\nUniversal Studios Hollywood\n: Includes the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park located in Hollywood, California and Universal CityWalk Hollywood, a dining, retail and entertainment complex. \n•\nUniversal Studios Japan\n: Includes the Universal Studios Japan theme park located in Osaka, Japan. \n•\nUniversal Beijing Resort\n: Includes the Universal Studios Beijing theme park, as well as Universal CityWalk Beijing, a dining, retail and entertainment complex, and on-site themed hotels, all of which are located in Beijing, China. Universal Beijing Resort is owned by us and a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOur Theme Parks segment properties are primarily owned by us, although certain properties are leased, including land in Beijing, China and Osaka, Japan. We have invested and will continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, as well as in new destinations and experiences, such as Epic Universe; Universal Kids Resort, a smaller-scale theme park in Frisco, Texas expected to open in 2026; and Universal Horror Unleashed, a year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas, Nevada expected to open in 2025. \nRevenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our theme parks, including ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise, and from our consumer products business. Revenue for our theme parks generally depends on the overall environment for travel and tourism, including consumer spending on leisure and other recreational activities. \nWe also license the right to use the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property and provide other services to third parties, including the party that owns and operates the Universal Studios Singapore theme park on Sentosa Island, Singapore. The themed elements in our rides, attractions, and merchandising are based on intellectual property in our Studios and Media segments and intellectual property licensed from third parties under long-term agreements. \nCompetition\nMedia\nOur Media segment competes for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers, including DTC streaming service providers; television networks; local broadcast television stations; physical and digital home en\ntertainment products; video on demand and pay-per-view services; online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content; gaming products; and other forms of entertainment, news and information. \nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n10\nTable of Contents\nMedia competes for the sale of advertising with digital properties, including an increasing number of ad-supported DTC streaming service providers and other online content, such as social networking platforms and user-generated content, as well as with other television networks and stations, and all other advertising platforms. The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and viewership at the related networks, stations or digital properties. Declines in audience ratings can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number and forms of entertainment choices available. Additionally, it is increasingly challenging to accurately measure fragmented audiences.\nOur domestic cable networks and international networks compete primarily with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage by multichannel video providers and DTC streaming service providers. Our domestic broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned local broadcast television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience. Peacock competes for subscribers primarily with other DTC streaming service providers, as well as with traditional providers of linear television programming.\nStudios\nOur film and television studios compete for audiences with other major film and television studios, independent film producers and creators of content, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position of our studios primarily depends on the number of films and television series and episodes produced, their distribution and marketing success, and consumer response. Our studios also compete to obtain creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors, and producers, as well as scripts for films and television shows, and for the distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. We also compete with other major film and television studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of content in theaters, on demand, on television networks, and on DTC streaming services.\nTheme Parks\nOur theme parks compete with other multi-park entertainment companies as well as other providers of entertainment, tourism, recreational activities and lodging. The competitive position of our theme parks primarily depends on the quality and popularity of rides and attractions, including effective use of intellectual property in themed attractions. There is increased competition in areas with high concentrations of theme parks and other attractions operated by several companies. Macroeconomic conditions and other factors may also result in shifting consumer preferences toward other types of destinations, experiences and products.\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nRevenue and costs and expenses in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the recognition of the related rights fees.\nRevenue in Media is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Domestic advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the winter holiday season, and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising, respectively. International advertising revenue typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months, with lower levels in summer months due to the timing of European football seasons, winter holidays and summer vacations. Revenue also fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year.\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, through DTC streaming services and viewing on demand, and on physical and digital home entertainment products. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the winter holiday season. We incur significant marketing expenses before and throughout the release of a film in movie theaters and as a result, we typically incur losses on a film prior to and during the film’s exhibition in movie theaters. Content licensing revenue also fluctuates due to the timing of when our film and television content is made available to licensees. Revenue from our television studios fluctuates in part due to a correlation with the broadcast network season beginning annually in September.\nRevenue in Theme Parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that typically result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the winter holiday season.\n11\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nCorporate and Other\nOur other business interests reported in Corporate and Other consist primarily of our Sky-branded video services and television networks in Germany, Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Xumo, our consolidated streaming platform joint venture with Charter Communications formed in June 2022. Xumo is focused on developing and offering a streaming platform on a variety of devices, including Xumo TV smart televisions, which have an operating system that leverages our global technology platform, and also operates the Xumo Play streaming service.\nLegislation and Regulation\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations. In the United States in particular, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), and Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) rules and regulations affect significant aspects of our communications businesses.\nBeyond the more significant regulations summarized below, legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. Applying existing laws in novel ways to new technologies, including streaming services and artificial intelligence (“AI”), may also affect our business. These legislators and regulators, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, have been active in conducting inquiries and reviews regarding our services. State legislative and regulatory initiatives can create a patchwork of different and/or conflicting state requirements, such as with respect to privacy and Open Internet/net neutrality regulations, that can affect our businesses and ability to effectively compete. \nLegislative and regulatory activity has increased in recent years, particularly with respect to broadband networks. For example, Congress has approved tens of billions of dollars in new funding for broadband deployment and adoption initiatives, and may consider other proposals that address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace. Federal agencies have considered adopting new regulations for communications services, including broadband, although it is uncertain whether those initiatives will continue under the new Administration. States and localities are increasingly proposing new regulations impacting communications services, including broader regulation of broadband networks. Regulators in various international jurisdictions are similarly considering changes to telecommunications and media requirements. Any of these regulations could significantly affect our business and our legal and compliance costs. In addition, United States and foreign regulators and courts could adopt new interpretations of existing competition or antitrust laws or enact new competition or antitrust laws or regulatory tools that could negatively impact our businesses. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses. \nThe following paragraphs summarize the more significant legal and regulatory requirements and risks affecting our businesses. \nCommunications-Related Regulations in the United States\nBroadband\nOur broadband services are subject to a number of regulations and commitments.\nIn 2023, the FCC adopted broad rules that prohibit digital discrimination of access to broadband service based on income level, race, ethnicity, color, religion and national origin; this order currently is subject to legal challenge in federal court. In 2024, the\n FCC reclassified broadband internet access services as a “telecommunications service” subject to traditional common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. However, a federal appellate court in January 2025 overturned that reclassification, ruling that broadband internet access service is an “information service” under Title I of the Communications Act and that the FCC does not have authority to subject broadband services to utility-style regulations such as rate regulation and market entry and exit requirements under Title II. As a Title I “information service,” broadband is only subject to light-touch regulation such as broadband disclosure requirements, and deployment, subscription, and pricing reporting requirements. States and localities have in the past enacted and may in the future periodically consider new broadband-related regulations, including those regarding government-owned broadband networks, net neutrality and broadband affordability, which could create a patchwork of, and potentially inconsistent, federal, state and local regulatory regimes. New broadband regulations, if adopted, may have adverse effects on our businesses, and we cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future litigation or how any rules will ultimately be interpreted and enforced and how they might affect our business.\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe, from time to time, participate in broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state levels and may also become subject to additional broadband-related commitments as a condition of receiving federal or state broadband funding. We cannot predict how and to whom any such funds will be awarded, when the initiatives will be terminated or the impact of these initiatives on our businesses.\nA number of municipalities operate municipally owned broadband networks, and there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create government-owned networks, particularly in light of federal funding for broadband deployment. Certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks, and there may be efforts in other state legislatures to restrict the development of government-owned networks. Other states, however, have amended or may amend such laws to facilitate such networks. Much of the federal funding authorized for broadband deployment is conditioned on states agreeing to make it available for potential use by government-owned networks, although the funding prioritizes deployment to unserved and underserved areas and locations. We cannot predict how successful any of those efforts will be and how they might affect our businesses.\nVideo and Media\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that apply to the cable services we provide through our Residential Connectivity & Platforms business and to our cable networks and local broadcast television stations in our Media business. These laws and regulations can constrain our ability to compete, particularly against DTC streaming service providers, which are not subject to these same requirements.\nFederal, state and local franchising rules and regulations may require us to provide adequate channel capacity, facilities and financial support for public, educational and governmental access programming; comply with certain renewal procedures for our franchise agreements; pay franchise fees; and comply with customer service, accessibility, and certain other requirements. In addition, the FCC and other federal agencies can impact the programming networks that we carry, as well as how we price, package, bill and market our video services. FCC regulations also require cable operators to carry programming transmitted by certain local broadcast television stations (“must-carry” requirement) or to negotiate a “retransmission consent” agreement with certain other stations that will frequently involve payments from cable operators to the station; govern program access by preventing cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring affiliated cable operators over competing multichannel video providers; grant licenses to broadcast television stations for 8-year cycles, which may not be renewed on favorable terms, or at all; limit local and national television ownership, as well as foreign ownership in a broadcast television station; and regulate children’s programming. \nThe FCC enforces these rules on a case-by-case basis based on complaints filed by consumers, state and local governments, and other entities. We have been involved in disputes at the FCC in some of these areas and may be involved in new disputes in the future, including potential disputes related to content moderation and free speech. We cannot predict the outcome of any such disputes or associated litigation. The FCC and Congress have previously considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with MVPDs and potentially with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. We currently offer our cable networks on a packaged basis (in “tiers”) and, in various cases, individually. We have been involved in program access disputes at the FCC and may be subject to new complaints in the future.\nFurthermore, certain states and localities have adopted laws to impose franchise or other fees on DTC streaming services. To date, courts have invalidated those laws, but we cannot predict the outcome of any future litigation.\nWireless\nWe offer a wireless voice and data service primarily using our MVNO rights to provide the service over Verizon’s wireless network. MVNOs are subject to many of the same FCC regulations as facilities-based wireless carriers, such as E911 services and local number portability, as well as certain state or local regulations. The FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for MVNOs and/or mobile broadband providers in the future, which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally.\nVoice\nWe provide voice services using VoIP technology. The FCC has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours, including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information, local number portability duties and benefits, disability access, E911, law enforcement assistance, outage reporting, Universal Service Fund contribution obligations, rural call completion, customer equipment back-up power, robocall mitigation, service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements. State regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of VoIP remains unsettled at the federal level.\n13\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nSpectrum Allocations\nThe FCC, the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other federal agencies have taken, and in some cases are preparing to take, steps to evaluate and potentially modify certain spectrum allocations and rules to make available additional spectrum that likely will be used for licensed and/or unlicensed commercial services, including 5G and Wi-Fi services, which could impact our businesses. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of these spectrum allocation actions. Additional commercial spectrum could impact current marketplace dynamics, including the ability of wireless providers to compete with our services. Further, if the FCC reallocates spectrum that our businesses currently use to provide services, we could be required to transition our operations to different frequencies in order to accommodate the reallocation of spectrum for 5G, which could disrupt our services and impose additional costs.\nInternational Communications-Related and Other Regulations\nCertain of our international businesses are subject to telecommunications and media-specific regulation, including those related to broadband and voice services and television networks, in Europe, Latin America, and other international jurisdictions, and all of our international businesses are subject to regulation under generally applicable laws, such as competition, consumer protection, data protection, and taxation in the jurisdictions where they operate. Our international businesses are currently, and may be in the future, subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate.\nOther Areas of Regulation\nIntellectual Property\nCopyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other proprietary-rights laws of the United States and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unauthorized copying, distribution and piracy of programming and films over the internet, through devices, software and websites, counterfeit DVDs/Blu-rays and through other platforms interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for our content businesses. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content. Although many legal protections exist to combat such practices, the extent of copyright protection is sometimes ambiguous and the use of technological protections can be controversial. Modifications to existing laws, a weakening of these protections or their enforcement or a failure of existing laws, in the United States or internationally, to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming.\nU.S. copyright laws establish a cable compulsory copyright license that requires our video distribution business to contribute a specified percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material included in broadcast signals. We also pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute. The cable compulsory copyright license and the royalties we pay are subject to audits and possible regulatory and legislative changes that could impact the royalty fees we pay and our ability to retransmit broadcast signals over cable systems. In addition, the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing, and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations. We cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay.\nPrivacy and Data Protection Regulation\nOur businesses are subject to laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the processing of individuals’ personal information. In the United States, federal privacy laws and regulations, such as those found within the Communications Act or the Video Privacy Protection Act, restrict companies’ collection, use, disclosure and retention of personal information. The proliferation of laws at the state level has expanded consumers’ rights to include individual rights of access, deletion, portability, correction, the right to appeal, and the individual’s right to “opt in” to collection and use of certain types of “sensitive” personal information. Internationally, many of the laws that apply to our businesses are similar to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act of 2018, which broadly regulate the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom, respectively.\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n14\nTable of Contents\nSome of our businesses are also subject to the FTC’s general oversight of consumer privacy protections through its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices, as well as through its enforcement authority over the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. The FTC has sought to expand its authority in this area through various rulemakings related to general privacy, targeted advertising and children’s privacy. There has been an increased focus on children’s privacy at both the state and federal levels within the United States, as well as internationally. These new laws may require changes to our products and services and could adversely affect our advertising businesses.\nIn addition, many international data protection laws, some federal laws, and all 50 U.S. states have security breach notification requirements that obligate businesses to provide notice to consumers and government agencies if certain information has been accessed or exfiltrated by an unauthorized party; some of these laws also require documented information security programs. \nState and Local Taxes\nSome U.S. states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing, through both legislative and administrative channels, new or additional taxes or fees on, or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by, our businesses, or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes, fees, incentives or credits are computed, earned or monetized. These include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes, central assessments for property tax, and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our businesses, most notably new taxes or fees on digital advertising or other digital commerce. In some situations, DBS providers and other competitors (such as DTC streaming service providers) that deliver their services over a broadband connection do not face the same state and local tax and fee burdens. Congress has also considered, and may consider again, proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these DBS providers or other competitors (such as DTC streaming service providers) that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (“ITFA”) prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges and discriminating against electronic commerce; however, some jurisdictions may challenge the ITFA or the application of the ITFA to our business, or may assert that certain taxes akin to right-of-way fees are not preempted by the ITFA or other federal laws. \nOther Regulations\nU.S. states and localities, and various regulatory authorities, actively regulate other aspects of our businesses, including our Studios and Theme Parks businesses, accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities, customer service standards, inside wiring, cable equipment, pole attachments, universal service fees, regulatory fees, public safety, telemarketing, leased access, indecency, loudness of commercial advertisements, advertising, political broadcasting, sponsorship identification, Emergency Alert System, equal employment opportunity and other employment-related practices, environmental-related matters, our equipment supply chain, and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations. In addition, our international businesses are subject to various similar regulations, including those that cover television broadcasting, programming, and advertising. We are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the FCC and other federal, state, and local agencies, as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities, which can result in fines, sanctions and/or ongoing compliance plans and government oversight. \nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 182,000 full-time and part-time employees calculated on a full-time equivalent basis. Approximately 30% of our employees were located in over 30 countries outside the United States, with larger workforce concentrations in the United Kingdom, Western Europe, East Asia and South Asia. We also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business. A small overall portion of our full-time U.S. employees are unionized, although many of Content & Experiences’ freelance and temporary writers, directors, actors, technical and production per\nsonnel, as well as some on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by industry-wide collective bargaining agreements or work councils.\n Outside the United States, employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.\nOur company has been built on a foundation of respect, integrity and trust, and we are committed to creating and fostering a work environment that promotes those values. As a global media and technology company, we have a wide range of employees, including management professionals, technicians, engineers, call center employees, theme park employees, and media talent and production employees. Some of our key workforce-related programs and initiatives include the following.\nEmployee Engagement\n•\nWe seek to create an engaged workforce through proactive listening and constructive dialogue, including through employee engagement surveys, as well as through employee resource groups.\n15\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\n•\nWe are committed to creating an environment that encourages employees to ask questions, raise concerns and speak up about a workplace issue or suspected illegal or unethical conduct. We\n \nprovide several channels for speaking up without fear of retaliation, including a helpline and a web portal that are administered by an independent third-party company and allow for anonymous reporting when permitted by applicable laws.\nTalent Development\n•\nWe provide a wide variety of opportunities for professional growth for all employees with in-classroom and online trainings and on-the-job experience.\n•\nWe offer education tuition assistance to full-time employees in the United States.\n•\nOur Board of Directors discusses succession planning for our CEO and the remainder of our senior executive management team at least once a year. Throughout the year, our senior executive management team, as well as a broader array of executives throughout our businesses, make presentations to the Board and its committees and interact with our directors informally outside of regularly scheduled Board meetings, which provides directors with meaningful insight into our current pool of talent, what attracts and retains our executives, and our company culture.\n•\nWe promote a culture that embraces equal opportunity for all.\n•\nComcast has nine voluntary employee resource groups with more than 36,000 members in 240 chapters across the U.S. These employee-led organizations are open to all and contribute to business priorities, career development, and foster an inclusive and collaborative workplace.\nHealth and Welfare Benefits\n•\nWe offer a robust portfolio of health and welfare programs and solutions designed to meet the unique needs of our employees and their families, delivered through a consistent and seamless member experience.\n•\nOur offerings include comprehensive and affordable health care coverage options along with a variety of additional tools and resources, including access to dedicated health care navigators, expert medical opinion services, virtual primary care services and a diabetes management program. In addition, we offer comprehensive family planning options, including for adoption and surrogacy, and provide specialized support teams to help employees manage all stages in the family planning journey including parenthood.\n•\nWe continue to invest in the emotional wellbeing of our employees and offer a broad array of tools and resources such as our Employee Assistance Program, which provides personal counseling sessions to support employees and their families and provide problem-solving support for a broad range of issues, including stress, anxiety, depression, substance use and more. We also offer various digital emotional wellbeing tools, including child learning and behavior support, meditation, stress management, sleep issues, depression, chronic pain and substance use.\nFinancial Benefits\n•\nWe focus on attracting and retaining employees by providing compensation and benefits packages that are competitive within the applicable market, taking into account the job position’s location and responsibilities. \n•\nWe provide competitive financial benefits such as a 401(k) retirement plan in the United States with a company match and other retirement arrangements internationally.\n•\nWe have employee stock purchase plans in the United States, United Kingdom, India and several other European countries where most of our full-time and part-time employees can purchase our stock at a discount. \n•\nWe generally grant stock-based awards on an annual basis to a meaningful portion of our employees, with over 24,000 employees receiving such awards in \n2024\n. \n•\nWe offer financial literacy training and counseling to support employees in making their own financial decisions.\nAvailable Information and Websites\nOur phone number is (215) 286-1700, and our principal executive offices are located at One Comcast Center, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2838.

We also continue to invest in our network to support higher-speed broadband offerings and to expand the number of homes and businesses passed. A competitive environment, which has increased in recent years, has had negative impacts on our customer relationships additions/(losses). In addition, government funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which provided a monthly discount towards broadband service for eligible low-income households, expired during the second quarter of 2024, which had a negative impact on our residential domestic broadband customer relationships. We believe our residential connectivity revenue will increase as a result of growth in average domestic broadband revenue per customer, as well as increases in domestic wireless and international connectivity revenue. At the same time, we expect continued declines in video revenue as a result of domestic customer net losses due to shifting video consumption patterns and the competitive environment, although customer net losses typically mitigate the impact of continued rate increases on programming expenses. We also expect continued declines in other revenue related to declines in wireline voice revenue. \nWe believe our Business Services Connectivity segment will continue to grow by offering competitive services, including enterprise solutions.\n35\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nConnectivity & Platforms Customer Metri\ncs\nNet Additions / (Losses)\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCustomer Relationships\nDomestic Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships\n(a)\n31,172\n \n31,648 \n(476)\n(212)\nInternational Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships\n(a)\n17,811\n17,847\n(36)\n(93)\nBusiness Services Connectivity customer relationships\n(b)\n2,626\n2,641\n(16)\n17 \nTotal Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships\n51,609\n52,136\n(527)\n(288)\nDomestic Broadband\nResidential customers\n29,373\n29,748\n(375)\n(64)\nBusiness customers\n2,469\n2,505\n(36)\n(2)\nTotal domestic broadband customers\n31,842\n32,253\n(411)\n(66)\nDomestic Wireless\nTotal domestic wireless lines\n(c)\n7,826\n6,588\n1,237\n \n1,275 \nDomestic Video\nTotal domestic video customers\n12,523\n14,106\n(1,583)\n(2,037)\nDomestic homes and businesses passed\n(d)\n63,692\n62,457\nDomestic broadband penetration of homes and businesses passed\n(e)\n49.8\n \n%\n51.5 \n%\n(a)\nResidential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships generally represent the number of residential customer locations that subscribe to at least one of our services.

The Writers Guild and the SAG work stoppages from May to September 2023 and July to November 2023, respectively, resulted in reduced content licensing revenue at our Studios segment and reduced programming and production costs at both our Studios and Media segments in 2023.\nWe continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including Epic Universe in Orlando, which we expect will open in May 2025, as well as in new destinations and experiences, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks.\n39\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nMedia Segment Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nChange \n2023 to 2024\nRevenue\nDomestic advertising\n$\n10,008\n \n$\n8,600 \n16.4\n \n%\nDomestic distribution\n11,826\n \n10,663 \n10.9\n \nInternational networks\n4,282\n \n4,109 \n4.2\nOther\n2,031\n \n1,983 \n2.4\n \nTotal revenue\n28,148\n \n25,355 \n11.0\n \nCosts and Expenses\nProgramming and production\n18,968\n \n16,921 \n12.1\n \nMarketing and promotion\n1,473\n \n1,389 \n6.1\n \nOther\n4,577\n \n4,091 \n11.9\n \nTotal costs and expenses\n25,017\n \n22,400 \n11.7\n \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n3,130\n \n$\n2,955 \n5.9\n \n%\nMedia Segment – Revenue\nRevenue increased in 2024 primarily due to the Paris Olympics in 2024.

Excluding incremental revenue associated with this event, domestic advertising revenue remained consistent in 2024 primarily due to a decrease in revenue at our linear television networks, offset by an increase in revenue at Peacock.\nDomestic distribution revenue \nprimarily consists of revenue generated from the distribution of our television networks operating predominantly in the United States to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers, and from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. Our revenue from distribution agreements is generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming on our television networks and a per subscriber fee. Distribution revenue also includes Peacock subscription fees.\nDomestic distribution revenue increased in 2024, including the impact of the Paris Olympics in 2024. Excluding incremental revenue associated with this event, domestic distribution revenue increased in 2024 primarily due to an increase in Peacock paid subscribers, partially offset by a decrease in revenue at our linear television networks. The decrease at our networks was primarily due to a decline in the number of subscribers, partially offset by contractual rate increases. \nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n40\nTable of Contents\nInternational networks revenue\n primarily consists of revenue generated by our networks operating predominantly outside the United States, including\n the Sky Sports networks in the United Kingdom and Italy. This revenue primarily results from the distribution of our television networks to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers and other platforms, as well as sales of advertising. A significant portion of this revenue comes from the Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment. \nInternational networks revenue increased in 2024 primarily due to an increase in revenue associated with the distribution of sports networks and the positive impact of foreign currency.\nOt\nher r\nevenue\n primarily consists of revenue generated from various digital properties and the licensing of our owned content and technology.\n*        *        *\nMedia segment total revenue included $4.9 billion and $3.4 billion related to Peacock in 2024 and 2023, respectively, including amounts related to the Paris Olympics in 2024. We had 36 million and 31 million paid subscribers of Peacock as of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Peacock paid subscribers represent customers from which we recognize distribution revenue, including both customers that pay us directly and customers receiving the service through arrangements with companies who sell Peacock on our behalf. In these arrangements, paid subscribers are counted based on the terms of the arrangement when the related revenue is recognized. As a result, certain customers are counted when they activate their account, while other customers are counted when the Peacock service is made available to them as part of their bundled service offering regardless of whether it is activated. \nMedia Segment – Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and production costs \nprimarily consists of the amortization of owned and licensed content, including sports rights, direct production costs, p\nroduction overhead, on-air talent costs and costs associated with the distribution of our television networks to multichannel video providers.\nProgramming and production costs increased in 2024 primarily due to costs associated with the Paris Olympics, an increase in other sports programming costs for our domestic television networks, the impact of foreign currency, an increase in entertainment content costs for our television networks, including the impact of the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages in the prior year, and higher programming costs at Peacock.\nMarketing and promotion expenses \nprimarily consists of the costs associated with promoting our television networks, Peacock and other digital properties. \nMarketing and promotion expenses increased in 2024 primarily due to increased costs associated with the Paris Olympics, partially offset by lower costs related to marketing for entertainment programming.\nOther expenses \nprimarily consists of salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses. \nOther expenses increased in 2024 primarily due to an increase in costs related to Peacock and higher severance charges in 2024.\n*        *        *\nMedia segment total costs and expenses included $6.7 billion and $6.1 billion related to Peacock in 2024 and 2023, respectively, including amounts related to the Paris Olympics in 2024.\n41\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nStudios Segment Results of Operations\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nChange \n2023 to 2024\nRevenue\nContent licensing\n$\n8,063\n \n$\n8,231 \n(2.0)\n%\nTheatrical\n1,693\n \n2,079 \n(18.6)\nOther\n1,335\n \n1,315 \n1.5\n \nTotal revenue\n11,092\n \n11,625 \n(4.6)\nCosts and Expenses\nProgramming and production\n7,257\n \n7,958 \n(8.8)\nMarketing and promotion\n1,483\n \n1,579 \n(6.1)\nOther\n947\n \n818 \n15.7\n \nTotal costs and expenses\n9,687\n \n10,356 \n(6.5)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,404\n \n$\n1,269 \n10.7\n \n%\nStudios Segment – Revenue\nC\nontent licensing r\nevenue\n primarily relates to the licensing of our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally to television networks and DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand services provided by multichannel video providers and other service providers. \nContent licensing revenue decreased in \n2024\n primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our film studios, partially offset by the timing of when content was made available by our television studios under licensing agreements, including the impact of the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages in the prior year.\nTheatrical r\nevenue\n primarily relates to the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. \nTheatrical revenue decreased in 2024 primarily due to higher revenue from releases in our 2023 slate, including \nThe Super Mario Bros.

This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. \nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. \nWe reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation from Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet income attributable to Comcast Corporation \n$\n16,192\n \n$\n15,388 \nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(315)\n(282)\nIncome tax expense\n2,796\n \n5,371 \nInterest expense\n4,134\n \n4,087 \nInvestment and other (income) loss, net\n490\n \n(1,252)\nDepreciation\n8,729\n \n8,854 \nAmortization\n6,072\n \n5,482 \nAdjustments\n(a)\n(30)\n(16)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n38,069\n \n$\n37,633 \n(a)\nAmounts represent the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, including costs associated with the Spin-off and costs related to our investment portfolio.\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n44\nTable of Contents\nConstant Currency\nConstant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Connectivity & Platforms, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Connectivity & Platforms business, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the businesses, and we believe they are helpful for investors because such measures present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to allow the evaluation of their underlying performance.\nConstant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current year period presented rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods. \nReconciliation of Connectivity & Platforms Constant Currency\n2023\nYear ended December 31 (in millions)\nAs Reported\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nConstant Currency Amounts\nRevenue\nResidential Connectivity & Platforms\n$\n71,946\n$\n355\n$\n72,301\nBusiness Services Connectivity\n9,255\n1\n9,256\nTotal Connectivity & Platforms revenue\n$\n81,201\n$\n356\n$\n81,557\nAdjusted EBITDA\nResidential Connectivity & Platforms\n$\n26,948\n$\n60\n$\n27,008\nBusiness Services Connectivity\n5,291\n(1)\n5,291\nTotal Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n32,239\n$\n60\n$\n32,299\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\nResidential Connectivity & Platforms\n37.5 \n%\n(10) bps\n37.4 \n%\nBusiness Services Connectivity\n57.2 \n— bps\n57.2 \nTotal Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA margin\n39.7\n \n%\n(10) bps\n39.6\n \n%\n2023\nAs Reported\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nConstant Currency Amounts\nAverage monthly total Connectivity & Platforms revenue per customer relationship\n$\n129.43 \n$\n0.57 \n$\n130.00 \nAverage monthly total Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship\n$\n51.39 \n$\n0.09 \n$\n51.48 \n \n2023\n(in millions)\nAs Reported\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nConstant Currency Amounts\nCosts and Expenses\nProgramming\n$\n18,067 \n$\n100 \n$\n18,167 \nTechnical and support\n7,416 \n27 \n7,443 \nDirect product costs\n6,146 \n84 \n6,230 \nMarketing and promotion\n4,720 \n22 \n4,741 \nCustomer service\n2,783 \n11 \n2,795 \nOther\n9,830 \n53 \n9,883 \nTotal Connectivity & Platforms costs and expenses\n$\n48,962\n \n$\n297\n \n$\n49,259\n \n45\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of Residential Connectivity & Platforms Constant Currency\n2023\n(in millions)\nAs Reported\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nConstant Currency Amounts\nRevenue\nDomestic broadband\n$\n25,489 \n$\n— \n$\n25,489 \nDomestic wireless\n3,664 \n— \n3,664 \nInternational connectivity\n4,207 \n112 \n4,319 \nTotal residential connectivity\n33,359 \n112 \n33,472 \nVideo\n28,797 \n169 \n28,966 \nAdvertising\n3,969 \n35 \n4,004 \nOther\n5,820 \n39 \n5,859 \nTotal revenue\n71,946\n \n355\n \n72,301\n \nCosts and Expenses\nProgramming\n18,067 \n100 \n18,167 \nOther\n26,932 \n195 \n27,126 \nTotal costs and expenses\n44,998 \n295 \n45,293 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n26,948\n \n$\n60\n \n$\n27,008\n \nOther Adjustments\nFrom time to time, we present adjusted information, such as revenue, to exclude the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges.

We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe entered into a new revolving credit facility in May 2024 (see Note 6). \nWe maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper program generally provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements.

Our revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant pertaining to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to EBITDA, as defined in the agreement. Compliance with this financial covenant is tested on a quarterly basis.

Payments of income taxes in 2024 were favorably impacted by the timing of transferable tax credit purchases, as payments for certain tax credits used in 2024 will be made in 2025. Additionally, we expect to receive a federal income tax refund in 2025 as a result of carrying back a capital loss created primarily as part of a 2024 internal corporate reorganization to offset capital gains recognized in our federal income tax returns for 2021 through 2023 (see Note 5).\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased in 2024 primarily due to net proceeds received as an advance on the sale of our interest in Hulu in the prior year (see Note 7), partially offset by decreased cash paid for intangible assets related to software development in the current year and decreased purchases of investments.\nWe expect to receive additional proceeds for the sale of our interest in Hulu following the finalization of the third-party appraisal process, at which time we will recognize the sale of our interest. See Note 7.\nIn September 2023, we entered into an agreement with T-Mobile to sell certain of our spectrum licenses. The agreement provides us with a right to remove certain licenses from the transaction, which will result in total cash consideration between $1.2 billion and $3.3 billion. The sale is expected to close in 2028 subject to various conditions and approvals.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures remained consistent in 2024 compared to 2023. Spending on theme park attractions increased in 2024, and included costs associated with the construction of Epic Universe. 2023 expenditures included the acquisition of land for potential theme park expansion opportunities. The costs associated with the construction of Universal Beijing Resort are presented separately in our consolidated statements of cash flows. See Note 7. \nOur most significant capital expenditures are within the Connectivity & Platforms business, and we expect that this will continue in the future. Connectivity & Platforms’ capital expenditures remained consistent in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to increased spending on line extensions and support capital, offset by decreased spending on customer premise equipment and scalable infrastructure.

In addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks, including Epic Universe. Capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions. \nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased in 2024 primarily due to repayment of a collateralized obligation in the prior year (see Note 7), a decrease in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, lower repurchases and repayments of debt in the current year, repayments of short-term borrowings, net in the prior year and higher proceeds from borrowings in the current year.\nIn September 2024, we issued €1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate euro senior notes maturing in 2032 and 2036 and entered into a corresponding cross-currency swap, effectively converting the debt to an aggregate U.S. dollar principal amount of $2.0 billion with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.72%. We also issued £750 million ($1.0 billion using exchange rates on the date of issuance) principal amount of fixed rate sterling senior notes maturing in 2040 with an interest rate of 5.25%. The net proceeds from this issuance were intended for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the early redemption of $725 million of our outstanding 5.25% Notes due 2025, which was completed in October 2024, and the repayment of certain of our other outstanding debt with near-term maturities. In May 2024, we issued $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes, which have maturities ranging between 2029 and 2054 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.38%. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for the repayment of our outstanding commercial paper, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nIn 2024, we made debt repayments of $3.6 billion, including $1.9 billion principal amount of notes due at maturity and $750 million of 5.250% Notes due 2025, $391 million of 3.950% Notes due 2025, $256 million of 3.375% Notes due 2025, and $104 million of 3.150% Notes due 2026.\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. In particular, we may repurchase varying amounts of our outstanding public notes and debentures with short to medium term maturities through privately negotiated or market transactions. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities. \nShare Repurchases and Dividends\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. In January 2024, our Board of Directors terminated our existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion effective as of January 26, 2024, which had no expiration date. In 2024, we repurchased a total of 212 million shares of our Class A common stock for $8.6 billion under our authorization programs. We did not purchase any shares outside of these programs. As of December 31, 2024, we had $7.0 billion remaining under the authorization, and in January 2025, our Board of Directors terminated the existing program and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15 billion, which has no expiration date. We expect to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock under this new authorization in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions.\nIn 2024, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.31 per share, including our fourth quarter dividend payable in January 2025 and we made dividend payments of $4.8 billion. In January 2025, our Board of Directors approved a 6.5% increase in our dividend to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis and approved our first quarter dividend of $0.33 per share, to be paid in April 2025. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe chart below summarizes share repurchases and dividend payments. In addition, we paid $463 million and $291 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans and excise taxes related to share repurchases. Our share repurchases have more than offset dilution that resulted from issuing our Class A common stock in connection with our share-based compensation plans in those years, thereby having the effect of reducing the total number of our Class A common stock outstanding.\nShare Repurchases Under Share Repurchase Program Authorization and Dividends Paid and Weighted-Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding - Diluted\n($ in billions and shares in millions)\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our most significant contractual obligations as of December 31, \n2024\n:\nAs of December 31, 2024 (in billions)\nTotal\nWithin the next 12 months\nBeyond the next 12 months\nDebt obligations\n(a)\n$\n105.1 \n$\n4.9 \n$\n100.2 \nProgramming and production obligations\n96.2 \n17.2 \n79.0 \n(a) Amounts represent the face value of debt and exclude interest payments. \nOur largest contractual obligations relate to our outstanding debt. As of December 31, \n2024\n, our debt had a weighted-average time to maturity of approximately 16 years. Including the effects of our derivative financial instruments, as of December 31, \n2024, \nour debt had a weighted-average interest rate based on the stated coupons of 3.7% and the percentage of our debt obligations that were fixed-rate debt was 98%. We typically fund and expect to continue to be able to fund debt maturities and interest payments with cash flows generated in our operations; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; or proceeds \nfrom additional external financing. See Note 6 and Item 7A for additional information on our debt. \nWe also have significant contractual obligations associated with our programming and production expenses. We have multiyear agreements for television and/or streaming rights of sporting events, such as for the NBA, the NFL, the Olympics and the English Premier League, which represent the substantial majority of our programming and production obligations. \nConnectivity & Platforms’ programming expenses related to the distribution of third-party television networks are generally acquired under multiyear distribution agreements with fees based on the number of subscribers receiving the television network programming and a per subscriber fee. The amounts included in the table above relate to minimum guaranteed commitments for these distribution agreements or fixed fees, and as a result, we expect the total fees to be paid under these arrangements to be significantly higher than the amounts included above. We have funded and expect to continue to be able to fund our programming and production obligations with the cash generated from our operations. As of December 31, \n2024\n, approximately 37% of cash payments related to our programming and production obligations are due after five years, of which the vast majority related to multiyear sports rights agreements. See Note 4 for additional information on programming and production costs.\nOur other contractual obligations relate primarily to operating leases (see Note 14) and other arrangements recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and/or disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, including benefit plan obligations (see Note 10), liabilities for uncertain tax positions (see Note 5), our remaining unfunded capital commitment to Atairos (see Note 7) and a contractual obligation related to an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks (see Note 14). \n49\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nGuarantee Structure\nOur debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.\nDebt and Guarantee Structure\nDecember 31 (in billions)\n2024\n2023\nDebt Subject to Cross-Guarantees\nComcast\n$\n94.6\n \n$\n91.9 \nNBCUniversal\n(a)\n1.6\n \n1.6 \nComcast Cable\n(a)\n0.9\n \n0.9 \n97.1\n \n94.4 \nDebt Subject to One-Way Guarantees\nSky\n3.0\n \n3.6 \nOther\n(a)\n0.1\n \n0.1 \n3.1\n \n3.8 \nDebt Not Guaranteed\nUniversal Beijing Resort\n(b)\n3.4\n \n3.5 \nOther\n1.4\n \n1.5 \n4.8\n \n5.0 \nDebt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net\n(6.0)\n(6.1)\nTotal debt\n$\n99.1\n \n$\n97.1 \n(a)\nNBCUniversal Media, LLC (“NBCUniversal”), Comcast Cable Communications, LLC (“Comcast Cable”) and Comcast Holdings Corporation (“Comcast Holdings”), which is included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees, are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations.\n(b)\nUniversal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 7 for additional information.\nCross-Guarantees\nComcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. \nThe Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $88 billion and $136 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $14 billion and $18 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n50\nTable of Contents\nOne-Way Guarantees\nComcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky Limited (“Sky\n”)\n, including all of its senior notes, and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. \nComcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis, and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $53 billion and $104 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $10 billion and $14 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt, and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe our estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. See also Notes 4 and 9.\nValuation and Impairment Testing of Goodwill and Cable Franchise Rights\nWe assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including cable franchise rights, annually as of July 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. In connection with our impairment assessment process, from time to time, we perform quantitative assessments of our reporting units and cable franchise rights in order to support our qualitative assessments.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level.\nWhen performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our reporting units primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates. Wh\nen performing this analysis, we also consider multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions.\n51\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nWe performed qualitative assessments in 2024 for goodwill in our Residential Connectivity & Platforms, Business Services Connectivity, Studios and Theme Parks segments in connection with our annual impairment testing. These analyses considered the results of previous quantitative assessments, and also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair value of these reporting units in our qualitative assessments, including changes in projected future cash flows, recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, discount rates, and changes in our market capitalization. Based on these assessments, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required. We performed a quantitative assessment in 2024 for goodwill in our Media segment. Based on this assessment, the estimated fair value of the Media reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and no impairment was required.\nChanges in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, such as expected cash flows, competitive factors, discount rates, and value indications from market transactions, including the proposed Spin-off of businesses within our Media segment, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.\nCable Franchise Rights\nOur cable franchise rights assets result from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. The value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market additional services in a particular service area. The amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. Typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights.\nWhen performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including the estimate of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates. \nIn 2024, we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. At the time of our previous quantitative assessment in 2022, which was pursuant to our practice of performing quantitative assessments of cable franchise rights approximately once every four years, the estimated fair values of our franchise rights substantially exceeded their carrying values. We also considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights in our qualitative assessment, including changes in our projected future cash flows, recent market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, discount rates, and changes in our market capitalization. Based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were substantially higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.\nChanges in market \nconditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, such as expected cash flows, competitive factors, discount rates, and value indications from market transactions, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the\n recognition of an impairment charge.\nFilm and Television Content\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as\n well as acquired libraries. We have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue.\nOur estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release. These estimates are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. Upon a film’s release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n52\nTable of Contents\nWith respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license window. Initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window. Once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window, revenue estimates for these additional windows or platforms, such as U.S. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution \nplatforms, are included in ultimate revenue. Revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns.\nCapitalized film and television costs are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a fil\nm group is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When performing an impairment assessment, we estimate fair value primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows, which are supported by internal forecasts. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract.\n53\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K\nTable of Contents",
