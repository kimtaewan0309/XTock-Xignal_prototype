As such, we do not believe that backlog at any particular time is necessarily indicative of our future operating results.\nSeasonality.\n \nOur business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns. We have begun to see seasonal patterns in our business, which we expect to become more pronounced as we continue to grow, with our strongest sequential revenue growth generally occurring in our fiscal second and fourth quarters.\nMANUFACTURING\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our products to various manufacturing partners, which include our electronics manufacturing services provider (“EMS provider”) and original design manufacturers. This approach allows us to reduce our costs as it reduces our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust more quickly to changing end-customer demand. Our EMS provider is Flextronics International, Ltd. (“Flex”), who assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts are based upon historical trends and analysis, adjusted for overall market conditions. All of our hardware products are assembled in the U.S. \nThe component parts within our products are either sourced by our manufacturing partners or by us from various component suppliers. Our manufacturing and supply contracts, generally, do not guarantee a certain level of supply or fixed pricing, which increases our exposure to supply shortages or price increases.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nWe believe our ongoing success depends on our employees. With a global workforce of 16,068 as of July 31, 2025, our People Strategy is a critical element of our overall company strategy and is overseen by our Chief People Officer who regularly updates our board of directors and the board’s Compensation and People Committee on human capital matters. Our People Strategy is designed to enable a workforce that is nimble, high-performing and innovative. We take a comprehensive approach to attracting, enabling and engaging world-class talent and fostering a culture where every employee can thrive. Our approach includes respecting each employee as a unique individual, demonstrating fairness in all we do and advancing a culture where employees are inspired to do the best work of their careers. We also focus on integrating AI into people programs and processes to build a more agile, skilled and forward-thinking workforce prepared for the future of cybersecurity. Our values of disruption, execution, collaboration, inclusion and integrity were co-created with employees and serve as the foundation of our culture. These values are embedded in our talent acquisition, learning and enablement, engagement and performance elevation, rewards and recognition programs.\nAttract & Hire.\n \nAt Palo Alto Networks, we source talent with the necessary skills and capabilities to contribute to our culture and mission. We utilize structured interviewing practices, thorough job analyses and success profiles to identify high-quality candidates and staff critical roles. In fiscal 2025, we began to transform our hiring operations by strategically embedding AI across the talent acquisition lifecycle to sharpen our competitive edge for talent. We are deploying intelligent tools to automate and enhance core processes, including AI-generated job descriptions, structured interview guides and preparation materials; intelligent interview scheduling; launching an automated talent sourcing and screening pilot; and using AI to augment feedback summaries. Each step is optimized for speed, consistency and bias mitigation. Recognizing that technical skills evolve rapidly in an AI-driven world, our recruitment strategy prioritizes durable, \"AI-readiness\" capabilities. We assess candidates for core competencies such as critical thinking, adaptability and a capacity for continuous learning to help ensure every hire can not only excel today but also innovate and lead in the future. \n- 11 \n-\nTable of Contents\nOur Global Hiring Committee continues to play a key role in maintaining our hiring standards, which help drive objectivity. This group of cross-functional senior leaders reviews finalist candidates’ information with a focus on experience and capability. To build robust talent pipelines, we partner with academic institutions and other organizations to support new careers in cybersecurity, promote open roles, proactively reach out to candidates across multiple hiring channels and source candidates with a range of experiences. We also encourage employee referrals.\nOnboard & Enable.\n Each member of our workforce has a unique career journey and individual needs, interests and goals. To that end, we strive to create an environment where everyone feels valued, respected and supported to solve the world’s toughest cybersecurity challenges.\nIn fiscal 2025, we started to evolve from a traditional training program to a system of AI-powered talent enablement, where we integrate learning and growth throughout the flow of an employee’s daily work. From day 1, new hires embark on a journey that blends in-person connection with personalized digital guidance, including generative AI onboarding roadmaps and AI-curated mentor networks. For ongoing growth, through The Learning Center, our intelligent learning platform, we deliver adaptive learning tracks for employees, including specialized paths for interns, new graduates and individuals joining through acquisitions. We also piloted real-time AI-enabled feedback simulations to coach and equip managers with the skills to guide their teams more effectively.\nDevelopment information about core business elements, required company-wide compliance training and information about activities on topics ranging from well-being to collaboration are also offered. To further support our employees to advance up the AI adoption curve, we have offered self-paced online certifications, live training and an experimentation challenge that encouraged peer-driven use cases and employees voting to select the finalists. We will continue our enablement journey, using employee questions and feedback to offer both practical and role-specific use cases to help increase productivity and new skill acquisition. On average, employees completed 36 hours of development during fiscal 2025.\nListen & Engage.\n \nWe aim to foster engagement and help employees feel connected to our mission and values. Through our comprehensive approach, we use in-person and virtual channels to provide a regular flow of information to and between employees and leadership. These channels include company meetings, digital displays across our sites, our intranet, regular email communications, an active Slack platform, pulse surveys, a peer-to-peer recognition platform and regular two-way dialogue—such as small, in-person listening sessions hosted by our chief executive officer.\nEmployee sentiment is also collected and measured from external sources, such as Glassdoor and Comparably. In addition, based on employee participation in an anonymous survey, the Best Practice Institute has certified Palo Alto Networks as one of the “Top 100 Global Most Loved Workplaces” since 2021. Palo Alto Networks has been recognized by Comparably for “Best Leadership Teams” and “Best Company Outlook”, in addition to other employer of choice awards. Our chief executive officer has also earned a 91% employee approval rating on Glassdoor, a top percentile score.\nIn addition to our formal, company-wide, semiannual performance review process, which helps employees set learning and development plans, we believe in always-on performance feedback. Further providing engagement are eleven Employee Network Groups, open to all employees, that leverage different perspectives to build, understand and support our culture. \nCompensation & Benefits.\n \nWe offer employees competitive compensation and our flexible benefits plans include a variety of health, time off, wellness and voluntary benefits. Our pay strategy, which includes base salary, cash bonus programs, and equity awards, focuses on compensation based on individual performance. Palo Alto Networks is a fair pay company and we annually engage a third-party consultancy to analyze our pay practices. Through our flexible benefits programs, employees are able to request reimbursement for a range of lifestyle items including fitness, caregiving and education. Additionally, through our Giving+ program, employees can request monetary matching of their charitable donations and volunteer time.\nHealth, Safety & Wellbeing. \nOur commitment to the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees includes providing tools, resources and benefits focused on physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. This includes courses designed to equip employees with the knowledge to work safely, safety awareness campaigns and a mental health hub on our employee intranet.\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY\nOur Corporate Responsibility (CR) strategy supports our company's purpose of a safe and secure world, and is informed through many inputs, including our business strategy and objectives, ongoing stakeholder engagement, investor and customer interests, benchmarking of industry best practices, regulatory developments and more. We execute meaningful CR initiatives that include advancing environmental sustainability, investing in people and operating with integrity.\nAdvance Environmental Sustainability.\n Palo Alto Networks is doing our part to limit global warming to less than 1.5°C. Our decarbonization pathway includes implementing operational efficiencies, procuring 100% renewable electricity, targeting greenhouse gas emissions reductions across our value chain and making progress on our science-based targets. We continue to be recognized by CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) as a “Supplier Engagement Assessment A-list.” We report progress towards our goals in our annual Corporate Responsibility report.\n- 12 \n-\nTable of Contents\nInvest in People.\n In addition to our People Strategy described in the section titled “Human Capital” above, we continue to communicate our expectations regarding labor standards, business practices and workplace health and safety conditions to our supply chain through our Global Supplier Code of Conduct. During fiscal 2025, we maintained our affiliate membership in the Responsible Business Alliance. As a company built on trust, continuing to be a leader in responsible business practices and social impact supports our corporate strategy. We made charitable grants through our donor-advised fund to support nonprofit organizations providing services in areas such as cybersecurity education and expanding pathways to cyber careers. We maintained our work to provide cybersecurity curriculum to schools, universities and nonprofit organizations to help prepare people for careers in cybersecurity. \nOperate with Integrity. \nIntegrity is one of our core values. Employees, contractors and suppliers are informed about our governance expectations, including through our Codes of Conduct, compliance training programs and ongoing communications. The Governance and Sustainability Committee of the board of directors provides primary oversight of corporate responsibility and the board of directors and applicable committees receive regular updates on corporate responsibility topics.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur website is located at www.paloaltonetworks.com, and our investor relations website is located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com.

Additionally, Unit 42 offers managed detection and response (“MDR”) and managed threat hunting services.\nFor fiscal 2025 and 2024, total revenue was $9.2 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 14.9%. Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our portfolio, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. We believe our portfolio will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues and new revenues as we continue to grow our end-customer base. As of July 31, 2025, we had end-customers in over 180 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries, including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include almost all of the Fortune 100 companies and a majority of the Global 2000 companies. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We primarily use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products, subscriptions, and support to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers. \nOur product revenue grew to $1.8 billion or 19.5% of total revenue for fiscal 2025, representing year-over-year growth of 12.4%. Product revenue is derived from sales of hardware products, primarily our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall, and software licenses, including SD-WAN, the VM-Series, and Panorama\n®\n. Our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire network security product line. Our hardware products and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-400, which is designed for small organizations and remote or branch offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7500, which is designed for large-scale data centers and service provider use. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our hardware products is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments, and in our CN-Series container firewalls, which secure container environments and traffic.\n- 43 \n-\nTable of Contents\nOur subscription and support revenue grew to $7.4 billion or 80.5% of total revenue for fiscal 2025, representing year-over-year growth of 15.5%. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with near real-time access to the latest intrusion prevention, web security, modern malware prevention, data loss prevention, CASB and AI security capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud. Our subscriptions also include security operations, which enable customers to leverage the AI-powered Cortex platform for advanced capabilities such as security information and event management, next-generation antivirus, endpoint detection and response, extended detection and response, identity threat detection and response, cloud detection and response, SOAR, ASM, and CNAPP for comprehensive cloud security. Additionally, we offer MDR for Cortex subscriptions, powered by Unit 42’s elite expertise. When customers purchase our physical, virtual, or container firewalls, or certain cloud offerings, they typically purchase support in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. In addition to the subscriptions purchased with these firewalls, customers may also purchase other subscriptions on a per-user, per-endpoint, or capacity-based basis. We also offer professional services, including incident response, risk management, and digital forensic services.\nWe continue to invest in innovation as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our portfolio, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products are essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. During fiscal 2025, we introduced several new offerings, including: Prisma Access Browser, new capabilities in our OT Security solution, Cortex Cloud, Prisma AIRS, and Cortex XSIAM 3.0. Additionally, in August 2024, we completed the acquisition of certain IBM QRadar assets, which we expect will help accelerate the growth of our Cortex business. Additionally, in July 2025, we completed the acquisition of Protect AI, which we expect will enhance the capabilities of our AI security platform. In July 2025, we also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Software Ltd. (“CyberArk”), an identity security company, which acquisition is expected to close during the second half of our fiscal 2026.\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our portfolio and support offerings within existing end-customers, focus on end-customer satisfaction, and address any product vulnerabilities. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. For additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIMPACT OF MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS ON OUR BUSINESS\nOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impact on customer behavior. Changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in enforcement and administration policies, may have an impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant changes in U.S. or global trade policy, including further expansion of U.S. export/imports controls and tariffs, as well as retaliatory actions by other countries, may materially and adversely affect our business. Further, economic conditions, including inflation, high interest rates, slow growth, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, supply chain disruptions, impacts of trade regulations or international trade disputes, and other conditions, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance. \nThe hostilities in Israel and the surrounding region have continued to result in economic and political uncertainty. While we have business operations in Israel, and intend to continue growing our presence in Israel, we currently do not expect significant business disruption. We are actively monitoring, evaluating, and responding to the situation.\nWe are also monitoring the impact of inflationary pressures and the tensions between China and Taiwan, and between the U.S. and China, which could have an adverse impact on our business or results of operations in future periods.\nKey Financial Metrics \nWe monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating income and margin below under “Results of Operations.”\nJuly 31,\n2025\n2024\n(in billions)\nNext-Generation Security Annualized Recurring Revenue\n$\n5.6 \n$\n4.2 \nRemaining performance obligations\n$\n15.8 \n$\n12.7 \n- 44 \n-\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended July 31,\n2025\n2024\n2023\n(dollars in millions)\nTotal revenue\n$\n9,221.5 \n$\n8,027.5 \n$\n6,892.7 \nTotal revenue year-over-year percentage increase\n14.9 \n%\n16.5 \n%\n25.3 \n%\nGross margin\n73.4 \n%\n74.3 \n%\n72.3 \n%\nOperating income\n$\n1,242.9 \n$\n683.9 \n$\n387.3 \nOperating margin\n13.5 \n%\n8.5 \n%\n5.6 \n%\nCash flow provided by operating activities\n$\n3,716.0 \n$\n3,257.6 \n$\n2,777.5 \nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)\n$\n3,469.8 \n$\n3,100.8 \n$\n2,631.2 \n•\nNext-Generation Security Annualized Recurring Revenue (“NGS ARR”). \nOur NGS ARR represents the annualized allocated revenue of all active contracts as of the final day of the reporting period related to all product, subscription and support offerings, excluding revenue from hardware products, and legacy attached subscriptions, support offerings and professional services. NGS ARR is an operating metric that we use to assess the strength and trajectory of our business. NGS ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations and does not represent our revenue under U.S. GAAP on an annualized basis, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. NGS ARR is not intended to be a replacement for forecasts of revenue. The scope of products, subscriptions, and support offerings that contribute to NGS ARR will generally increase over time as we introduce or acquire new next-generation products, subscriptions, and support offerings. \n•\nCash Flow Provided by Operating Activities.\n We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as share-based compensation costs, depreciation, and amortization, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.\n•\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP).\n We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the corresponding promised products and subscriptions and support to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products and subscriptions and support. We expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors. \nPRODUCT REVENUE\nProduct revenue is derived from sales of hardware products, primarily our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall, and software licenses, including SD-WAN, the VM-Series, and Panorama. Our hardware products and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. We recognize product revenue at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license. As a percentage of product revenue, we expect our revenue from software licenses to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we improve features and capabilities of our on-premise software, renew our software license contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.\nYear Ended July 31,\nYear Ended July 31,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n2024\n2023\nChange\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\n \n(dollars in millions)\nProduct\n$\n1,801.9 \n$\n1,603.3 \n$\n198.6 \n12.4 \n%\n$\n1,603.3 \n$\n1,578.4 \n$\n24.9 \n1.6 \n%\nProduct revenue increased for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 driven by an increase in price of, and allocation to, on-premise software licenses due to enhanced features and capabilities beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and an increased demand for our new generation of hardware products and accessories, partially offset by decreased demand for our prior generation of hardware products.\nSUBSCRIPTION AND SUPPORT REVENUE\nSubscription and support revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings. Our subscription and support contracts are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over time as the services are performed. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our subscription and support revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing subscription and support contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.\nYear Ended July 31,\nYear Ended July 31,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n2024\n2023\nChange\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\n \n(dollars in millions)\nSubscription\n$\n4,974.4 \n$\n4,188.5 \n$\n785.9 \n18.8 \n%\n$\n4,188.5 \n$\n3,335.4 \n$\n853.1 \n25.6 \n%\nSupport\n2,445.2 \n2,235.7 \n209.5 \n9.4 \n%\n2,235.7 \n1,978.9 \n256.8 \n13.0 \n%\nTotal subscription and support\n$\n7,419.6 \n$\n6,424.2 \n$\n995.4 \n15.5 \n%\n$\n6,424.2 \n$\n5,314.3 \n$\n1,109.9 \n20.9 \n%\nSubscription and support revenue increased for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 due to increased demand for our subscription and support offerings from our end-customers.

Our cost of product revenue also includes personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and travel associated with our operations organization, inventory excess and obsolete charges, shipping and tariff costs, amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, and shared costs. Shared costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount.

We expect our cost of subscription and support revenue to increase as our installed end-customer base grows and adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increases. \n \nYear Ended July 31,\nYear Ended July 31,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n2024\n2023\nChange\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\n \n(dollars in millions)\nCost of subscription and support revenue\n$\n2,038.4 \n$\n1,711.0 \n$\n327.4 \n19.1 \n%\n$\n1,711.0 \n$\n1,491.4 \n$\n219.6 \n14.7 \n%\n- 48 \n-\nTable of Contents\nCost of subscription and support revenue increased for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to increased costs to support the growth of our subscription and support offerings. Cloud hosting service costs, which support our cloud-based subscription offerings, increased $189.5 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Personnel costs grew $52.9 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to headcount growth. The increase in cost of subscription and support revenue was further driven by increased professional services expense.\nGROSS MARGIN\nGross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, manufacturing costs, the average sales price of our products, cloud hosting service costs, personnel costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between product and subscription and support offerings. Our higher-end firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower-end firewall products within each product series.

Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include shared costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount to each department. We expect operating expenses generally to increase in absolute dollars and to decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. As of July 31, 2025, we expect to recognize approximately $2.2 billion of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype-related expenses and shared costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\n \nYear Ended July 31,\nYear Ended July 31,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n2024\n2023\nChange\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\nAmount\nAmount\nAmount\n%\n \n(dollars in millions)\nResearch and development\n$\n1,984.1 \n$\n1,809.4 \n$\n174.7 \n9.7 \n%\n$\n1,809.4 \n$\n1,604.0 \n$\n205.4 \n12.8 \n%\nResearch and development expense increased for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to increased personnel costs, which grew $123.4 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, largely due to headcount growth.

We had a benefit from income taxes during fiscal 2024 primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance on U.S. federal, U.S. states other than California, and U.K. deferred tax assets.

This is also the primary driver of the change in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2025, we recorded a deferred tax provision of $218.5 million arising from the remeasurement of our basis differences associated with the U.S. tax effects of foreign deferred tax assets. Our remeasurement is a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBB\") enacted on July 4, 2025 which provides for significant tax law changes and modifications including changes to the U.S. effective tax rates on certain foreign earnings.

As of July 31, 2025, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis difference relating to our U.S. investment in foreign subsidiaries. However, there could be local withholding taxes due to various foreign countries if certain lower tier earnings are distributed. Withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings are not material.\nDEBT\nIn June 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. The 2025 Notes were converted prior to or settled on the maturity date of June 1, 2025. During fiscal 2025, we repaid in cash $965.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes and issued 14.0 million shares of common stock to the holders for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes converted, which were fully offset by shares we received from our exercise of the associated note hedges. \nIn April 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), with an option to increase the amount of the Credit Facility by up to an additional $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions. The interest rates and commitment fees are also subject to upward and downward adjustments based on our progress towards the achievement of certain sustainability goals. As of July 31, 2025, there were no amounts outstanding, and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 11.

Our board of directors subsequently authorized additional increases to this share repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to $4.1 billion. Repurchases will be funded from available working capital and may be made at management’s discretion from time to time. As of July 31, 2025, $1.0 billion remained available for future share repurchases under this repurchase program. The repurchase authorization will expire on December 31, 2025, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Refer to Note 14.

As of July 31, 2025, we have total contingent consideration obligation of $513.6 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 3. Fair Value Measurements and Note 8. Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our contingent consideration obligation.\n- 52 \n-\nTable of Contents\nOn July 30, 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CyberArk. The acquisition is expected to close during the second half of our fiscal 2026, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, CyberArk shareholders will receive $45.00 in cash and 2.2005 shares of our common stock for each CyberArk share. This represents an equity value for CyberArk of approximately $25 billion based on the unaffected 10-day average daily volume-weighted average trading prices of our common stock as of July 25, 2025. We expect to fund the cash portion of the consideration with our cash on hand. Refer to Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K and Note 8. Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the acquisition.\nCASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023:\nYear Ended July 31,\n2025\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n3,716.0 \n$\n3,257.6 \n$\n2,777.5 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(2,204.7)\n(1,509.9)\n(2,033.8)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(778.9)\n(1,343.1)\n(1,726.3)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n732.4 \n$\n404.6 \n$\n(982.6)\nCash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties detailed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the investments in our infrastructure to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, the continuing market acceptance of our products and subscription and support offerings and macroeconomic events. In addition, from time to time, we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain corporate structuring decisions.\nWe may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOPERATING ACTIVITIES\nOur operating activities have consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Our largest source of cash provided by our operations is receipts from our customers. Net cash provided by operating activities can be impacted by factors such as timing of payments and collections, vendor payment terms, and timing and amount of tax payments.\nCash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2025 was $3.7 billion, an increase of $458.4 million compared to fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily due to growth of our business as reflected by increases in collections during fiscal 2025, partially offset by higher cash expenditure to support our business growth.\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES\nOur investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.\nCash used in investing activities during fiscal 2025 was $2.2 billion, an increase of $694.8 million compared to fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net cash payments for business acquisitions and higher purchases of investments during fiscal 2025.\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES \nOur financing activities have consisted of repayments of our convertible senior notes, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards. \nCash used in financing activities during fiscal 2025 was $778.9 million, a decrease of $564.2 million compared to fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock which did not recur during fiscal 2025.\n- 53 \n-\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates \nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future consolidated financial statements will be affected. \nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe majority of our contracts with our customers include various combinations of our products and subscriptions and support. Our hardware products and software licenses are distinct from our subscriptions and support services as the customer can benefit from the product without these services and such services are separately identifiable within the contract. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. The amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.\nWhen estimating standalone selling price, we first consider the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate it based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (channel partner or end-customer), the geographies in which our offerings were sold (domestic or international), and offering type (products, subscriptions, or support). As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated standalone selling prices, and as a result the timing and classification of our revenue could be affected.\nINCOME TAXES\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for all future benefits including, but not limited to, net operating losses, research and development credit carryforwards, and basis differences relating to our global intangible low-taxed income. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nWe recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process which includes evaluating if a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit and then measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more-likely-than-not standard has been met and in determining the expected benefit when developing the provision for income taxes. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits, and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in these or other factors could result in material increases or decreases in our provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the period in which we make the change.\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible, then we disclose the possible loss or range of the possible loss or state that such an estimate cannot be made. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted, or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\n- 54 \n-\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses. Refer to the “Litigation” subheading in Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our litigation.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nWe make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to purchased intangible assets, in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired business. Critical estimates in valuing certain purchased intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive on such recreated assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.\nOne of our business combinations has included post-closing payments contingent upon the occurrence of future events and/or certain conditions being met. Critical estimates used in valuing our contingent consideration obligation include, but are not limited to, estimated future cash payments related to customers entering into qualified new transactions and risk-adjusted discount rates used to present value the expected cash flows. These estimates and assumptions are updated to revalue our contingent consideration liability at the end of each reporting period. Accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nRefer to “Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement” and “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition.\n- 55 \n-\nTable of Contents",
