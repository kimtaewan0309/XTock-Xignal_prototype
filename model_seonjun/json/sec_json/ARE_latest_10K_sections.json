Risk factors\n” and “\nItem 7. Management’s discussion and \nanalysis of financial condition and results of operations\n” in this annual report on Form 10-K.\n2\nBusiness objective and strategies\nA key element of our business strategy is our unique focus on Class A/A+ properties primarily located in collaborative \nMegacampus™ ecosystems in AAA life science innovation clusters. Our Megacampus ecosystems are designed for optionality and \nscalability, offering our tenants a clear path to address their growth requirements, including through our future developments and \nredevelopments. Strategically located near top academic and medical research institutions and equipped with curated amenities and \nservices, and convenient access to transit, our Megacampus ecosystems are designed to support our tenants in attracting and retaining \ntop talent, which we believe is a key driver of tenant demand for our properties. Our strategy also includes drawing upon our deep, \nbroad, and longstanding real estate and life science industry relationships in order to retain tenants, identify and attract new and leading \ntenants, and source additional real estate.\nOur tenant base is broad and diverse within the life science industry. For a more detailed description of our properties and \ntenants, refer to “\nItem 2. Properties\n” in this annual report on Form 10-K. We have an experienced Board of Directors (the “Board”) and \nare led by an executive and senior management team with extensive experience in the real estate and life science industries.\nAcquisitions\nWe seek to identify and acquire high-quality properties in our cluster markets. Critical evaluation of prospective property \nacquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy. When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of \nmatters relating to the prospective property or properties, including:\n•\nProximity to centers of innovation and technological advances;\n•\nLocation of the property and our strategy in the relevant market, including our Megacampus strategy;\n•\nQuality of existing and prospective tenants;\n•\nCondition and capacity of the building infrastructure;\n•\nPhysical condition of the structure and common area improvements;\n•\nQuality and generic characteristics of the improvements;\n•\nOpportunities available for leasing vacant space and for re-tenanting or renewing occupied space;\n•\nAvailability of and/or ability to add appropriate tenant amenities;\n•\nAvailability of land for future ground-up development of new space;\n•\nOpportunities to generate higher rent through redevelopment of existing space;\n•\nThe property’s unlevered yields; \n•\nPotential impacts of climate change and extreme weather conditions; and\n•\nOur ability to increase the property’s long-term financial returns.\nDevelopment, redevelopment, and pre-construction\nA key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new\n \nClass A/A+ properties, as well as property enhancements identified during the underwriting of certain acquired properties. These efforts\n \nare primarily concentrated in collaborative Megacampus ecosystems within AAA life science innovation clusters, as well as other\n \nstrategic locations that support innovation and growth. These projects are generally focused on providing high-quality, generic, and\n \nreusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of a wide range of tenants. Upon completion, each development or\n \nredevelopment project is expected to generate increases in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development and\n \nredevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher\n \noccupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.\nDevelopment projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable laboratory facilities. \nRedevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of acquired office, warehouse, or shell space into laboratory space. \nWe generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new Class A/A+ laboratory space without \nfirst securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality Class A/A+ properties. \nPriority anticipated projects are those most likely to commence future ground-up development or first-time conversion from \nnon-laboratory space to laboratory space prior to our other future projects, pending market conditions and leasing negotiations.\nPre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of \nconstruction of aboveground building improvements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time \nrequired to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and \nare required for the vertical construction of buildings. Ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to \ngenerate significant revenue and cash flows.\nAnother key component of our business model is our redevelopment of acquired office, warehouse, or shell space into high-\nquality, generic, and reusable laboratory space that can be leased at higher rental rates. Our redevelopment strategy generally includes \nsignificant pre-leasing of projects prior to the commencement of redevelopment.\n3\nNon-real estate investments\nWe hold investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily \ninvolved in the life science industry.\n We \ninvest primarily in highly innovative entities whose focus on the development of therapies and products that advance human health and \ntransform patients’ lives is aligned with Alexandria’s purpose of making a positive and meaningful impact on the health, safety, and well-\nbeing of the global community. Our status as a REIT limits our ability to make such non-real estate investments. Therefore, we conduct, \nand will continue to conduct, our non-real estate investment activities in a manner that complies with REIT requirements. \nBalance sheet and financial strategy\nWe seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution to our stockholders \nthrough the ownership, operation, management, and selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment of new Class A/A+ \nproperties primarily located in collaborative Megacampus ecosystems in AAA life science innovation clusters, as well as the prudent \nmanagement of our balance sheet. In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash \navailable for distribution to our stockholders by:\n•\nMaintaining access to diverse sources of capital, which include, among others, net cash flows from operating activities \nafter dividends, incremental leverage-neutral debt supported by growth in EBITDA, strategic value harvesting and asset \nrecycling through real estate dispositions and sales of partial interests, non-real estate investment sales, sales of equity, \nand joint venture capital;\n•\nMaintaining significant liquidity through borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial \npaper program, secured construction loans, marketable securities, issuances of forward equity contracts from time to time, \nand cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash;\n•\nContinuing to improve our credit profile;\n•\nMinimizing the amount of debt maturing in a single year;\n•\nMaintaining commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;\n•\nMaintaining low to modest leverage;\n•\nMinimizing variable interest rate risk;\n•\nGenerating high-quality, strong, and increasing operating cash flows;\n•\nSelectively selling real estate assets, including land parcels, non-core operating assets, and sales of partial interests, and \nreinvesting the proceeds into our highly leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects;\n•\nAllocating capital to Class A/A+ properties located in collaborative Megacampus™ ecosystems in AAA life science \ninnovation clusters;\n•\nMaintaining geographic diversity in intellectual centers of innovation;\n•\nSelectively acquiring high-quality life science space in our target innovation cluster submarkets at prices that enable us to \nrealize attractive returns;\n•\nSelectively developing properties in our target innovation cluster submarkets;\n•\nSelectively redeveloping acquired office, warehouse, or shell space, or newly acquired properties, into high-quality, \ngeneric, and reusable laboratory space that can be leased at higher rental rates in our target innovation cluster \nsubmarkets;\n•\nRenewing existing tenant space at higher rental rates to the extent possible;\n•\nMinimizing tenant improvement costs;\n•\nImproving investment returns through the leasing of vacant space and the replacing of existing tenants with new tenants \nat higher rental rates;\n•\nExecuting leases with high-quality tenants and proactively monitoring tenant health;\n•\nMaintaining solid occupancy while attaining high rental rates;\n•\nRealizing contractual rental rate escalations; and\n•\nImplementing effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions in tenant leases for operating \nexpenses and certain capital expenditures. \n4\nCompetition\nIn general, other laboratory and technology properties are located in close proximity to our properties. The amount of rentable \nspace available in any market could have a material effect on our ability to rent space and on the rental rates we can attain for our \nproperties. In addition, we compete for investment opportunities with other REITs, insurance companies, pension and investment funds, \nprivate equity entities, partnerships, developers, investment companies, owners/occupants, and foreign investors. Many of these \nentities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to invest more than we can or accept more risk than \nwe are willing to accept. These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the overall \nexpected returns from real estate investments. In addition, as a result of their financial resources, our competitors may offer more free \nrent concessions, lower rental rates, or higher tenant improvement allowances in order to attract tenants. These leasing incentives \ncould hinder our ability to maintain or raise rents and attract or retain tenants. Competition may also reduce the number of suitable \ninvestment opportunities available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. Competition in \nacquiring existing properties and land, both from institutional capital sources and from other REITs, has been very strong over the past \nseveral years; however, we believe we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors. With our founding in 1994, Alexandria \npioneered the life science real estate niche. Today, we are the preeminent and longest-tenured owner, operator, and developer of \ncollaborative Megacampus ecosystems in AAA life science innovation cluster locations. We continue to maintain and cultivate many of \nthe most important and strategic relationships in the life science industry.\nSegment information\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, our operating segments consist of the following geographic markets: Greater Boston, San \nFrancisco Bay Area, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland,\n Research Triangle, New York City, Texas, and Canada\n. Refer to Note 18 – \n“Segment information” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nRegulation\nGeneral\nProperties in our markets are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including regulations relating to common \nareas. We believe we have the necessary permits and approvals to operate each of our properties.\nAmericans with Disabilities Act\nOur properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) to the extent that such \nproperties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to permit access by \npersons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our \nproperties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur substantial capital expenditures to \naddress the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of \ndamages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to \nassess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.\nEnvironmental matters\nUnder various environmental protection laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for \ncontamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to \ninvestigate and remediate contamination located on or emanating from that property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to \nwhether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and \nseveral. Previous owners may have used some of our properties for industrial and other purposes, so those properties may contain \nsome level of environmental contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties \nmay expose us to third-party liability or may materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, or develop the real estate or to borrow \ncapital using the real estate as collateral.\nState regulations, such as California’s Connelly Act and Proposition 65, among others, require certain building owners and \noperators to disclose information on the presence of asbestos or other harmful substances. Some of our properties may have asbestos-\ncontaining building materials. Environmental laws require that asbestos-containing building materials be properly managed and \nmaintained and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. These \nlaws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-\ncontaining building materials.\nIn addition, some of our tenants handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their routine operations at our properties. \nEnvironmental laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from such activities. Environmental \nliabilities could also affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. We require our tenants to comply with these environmental \nlaws and regulations and to indemnify us against any related liabilities. \n5\nIndependent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on the properties \nin our portfolio. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the \nsurveyed property and surrounding properties and do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations, or an asbestos \nsurvey. To date, these assessments have not revealed any material environmental liability that we believe would have a material \nadverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations, and ongoing expenditures to comply with existing environmental \nregulations are not expected to be material. Nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our properties have not revealed all \nenvironmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns that may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the \nfuture; and future laws, ordinances, or regulations may also impose additional material environmental liabilities.\nInsurance\nWith respect to our properties, we carry commercial general liability insurance, and all-risk property insurance, including \nbusiness interruption and loss of rental income coverage. We select policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be \nappropriate given the relative risk of loss and the cost of the coverage. In addition, we have obtained earthquake insurance for certain \nproperties located in the vicinity of known active earthquake zones in an amount and with deductibles we believe are commercially \nreasonable. We also carry environmental insurance and title insurance policies on our properties. We generally obtain title insurance \npolicies when we acquire a property, with each policy covering an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property. \nAccordingly, any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of the related property. Additional \ninformation about risk factors that may affect us is included in “\nItem 1A. Risk factors\n” in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nAvailable information\nCopies of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, including any \namendments to the foregoing reports, are available, free of charge, through our corporate website at www.are.com as soon as is \nreasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

We place a significant focus on building loyalty and trusted relationships\nwith our employees. We have a Business Integrity Policy that applies to all of our employees, and its receipt and review by each\nemployee is documented and verified annually. To promote an exceptional corporate culture, Alexandria monitors employee satisfaction,\nactively seeks employee feedback, and enhances our employee benefit offerings. We conduct annual performance reviews with our\nemployees, administer formal employee surveys, and our talent management team holds regular meetings with employees to gather\ninsights and drive ongoing improvements to the overall employee experience. \nWe recognize that the fundamental strength of Alexandria is driven by the contributions of each and every team member and \nthat our future growth relies on their continued success. We make substantial effort to hire, develop, and retain talented employees, and \nwe have an exceptional track record of promoting highly qualified candidates from within the Company. Our executive and senior \nmanagement teams, represented by\n \n62\n individuals at \nsenior vice president level and above, have an average of \n24\n years of real estate \nexperience, including \n13\n years with Alexandria. Moreover, our executive management team alone averages \n19\n years of experience with \nthe Company. Alexandria’s executive and senior management teams have unique experience and expertise in creating, owning, and \noperating highly dynamic and collaborative Megacampus ecosystems in key life science cluster locations. These teams include regional \nmarket directors with leading reputations and longstanding relationships within the life science community in their respective markets. \nWe believe that our expertise, experience, reputation, and key relationships in the real estate and life science industries provide \nAlexandria with significant competitive advantages in attracting new business opportunities.\nOur ability to retain talent further supports our business continuity and leadership stability. From \n2020\n to\n \n2024\n, our voluntary \nand total turnover rates averaged \n4.0%\n and \n8.5%\n, respectively, which are below the REIT industry averages of \n11.0%\n and \n15.0%\n, \nrespectively, as reported in the \n2024\n Nareit Compensation & Benefits Survey (data for \n2023\n).\nOffering robust benefits to support our employees’ health and overall success\nWe provide a robust benefits package intended to meet and exceed the needs of our employees and their families. Our \ncompany-sponsored benefits cover 100% of insurance premiums for both employees and their dependents, and include a wide range of \nofferings, such as a high-coverage, low-deductible preferred provider organization (“PPO”) medical plan, PPO dental and orthodontia \ncoverage, a vision plan, a comprehensive prescription drug program, infertility and family planning benefits, short-term and long-term \ndisability benefits, and life and accidental death and dismemberment coverage. \nInvesting in professional development and training\nWe provide meaningful opportunities for growth and development through a variety of learning opportunities, including \ndevelopment programs that leverage social learning, instructor-led trainings, on-demand trainings and resources, and a highly utilized \nmentoring program. Development programs and trainings cover topics such as leadership development, project management, business \nwriting, change management, interviewing, presentations, productivity, goal setting, delegation, communication, and feedback. Our \nmentoring program enables employees to partner with senior leaders throughout the organization for support and career guidance.\n7\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS \nOverview\nThe following risk factors\n \nmay adversely affect our overall business,\n \nfinancial condition, results of operations, and cash flows; \nour ability to make distributions to our stockholders; our access to capital; or the market price of our common stock, as further described \nin each risk factor below. In addition to the information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, one should carefully review and \nconsider the information contained in our other reports and periodic filings that we make with the SEC. Those risk factors could \nmaterially affect our overall business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows; our ability to make distributions to our \nstockholders; our access to capital; or the market price of our common stock. The risks that we describe in our public filings are not the \nonly risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider immaterial, also may \nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additional information regarding forward-looking \nstatements is included in the beginning of Part I in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nRisk factors summary\nAn investment in our securities involves various risks. Such risks, including those set forth in the summary of material risks in \nthis Item 1A, should be carefully considered before purchasing our securities.\nRisks related to operating factors\n•\nWe may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions, investments, or development or redevelopment projects or to \nsuccessfully and profitably operate properties.\n•\nWe could default on our ground leases or be unable to renew or re-lease our land or space on favorable terms or at all. \nOur tenants may also be unable to pay us rent.\n•\nThe cost of maintaining and improving the quality of our properties may be higher than anticipated, and we may be unable \nto pass any increased operating costs through to our tenants, which can result in reduced cash flows and profitability. \n•\nWe could be held liable for environmental damages resulting from our tenants’ use of hazardous materials, or from \nharmful mold, poor air quality, or other defects from our properties, or we could face increased costs in complying with \nother environmental laws.\n•\nThe loss of services of any of our senior officers or key employees and increased competition for skilled personnel could \nadversely affect us and/or increase our labor costs.\n•\nWe rely on a limited number of vendors to provide utilities and other services at our properties, and disruption in such \nservices may have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\n•\nOur insurance policies may not adequately cover all of our potential losses, or we may incur costs due to the financial \ncondition of our insurance carriers.\n•\nWe may change business policies without stockholder approval.\n•\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n•\nIf we failed to qualify as a REIT, we would be taxed at corporate rates and would not be able to take certain deductions \nwhen computing our taxable income.\n•\nWe may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund our operations due to adverse changes in our credit ratings, our \ninability to refinance our existing debt or issue new debt, or our inability to sell existing real estate and non-real estate \nassets timely or at optimal prices.\n•\nWe may invest or spend the net proceeds from our equity or debt offerings in ways with which our investors may not agree \nand in ways that may not earn a profit.\n•\nOur debt service obligations may restrict our ability to engage in some business activities or cause other adverse effects \non our business.\n•\nWe face risks and liabilities associated with our investments (including those in connection with short-term liquid \ninvestments) and the companies in which we invest (including properties owned through partnerships, limited liability \ncompanies, and joint ventures, as well as through our non-real estate venture investment portfolio), which expose us to \nrisks similar to those of our tenant base and additional risks inherent in venture capital investing. We may be limited in our \nability to diversify our investments.\nRisks related to market and industry factors\n•\nThere are limits on ownership of our stock under which a stockholder may lose beneficial ownership of its shares, as well \nas certain provisions of our charter and bylaws that may delay or prevent transactions that otherwise may be desirable to \nour stockholders.\n•\nPossible future sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect its market price.\n•\nWe are dependent on the health of the life science industry, and changes within this industry, increased competition, or the \ninability of our tenants and non-real estate equity investments within this industry to obtain funding for research, \ndevelopment, and other operations may adversely impact their ability to make rental payments to us or adversely impact \ntheir value.\n8\n•\nMarket disruption and volatility, poor economic conditions in the capital markets and global economy, including in \nconnection with a widespread pandemic or outbreak of a highly infectious or contagious disease, and tight labor markets \ncould adversely affect the value of the companies in which we hold equity investments or the ability of tenants and the \ncompanies in which we invest to continue operations, raise additional capital, or access capital from venture capital \ninvestors or financial institutions on favorable terms or at all.\nRisks related to government and global factors\n•\nActions, policy, or key leadership changes in government agencies, or changes to laws or regulations, including those \nrelated to tax, accounting, debt, derivatives, government spending, or funding (including those related to the FDA, the \nNational Institutes of Health (the “NIH”), the SEC, and other agencies), and drug and healthcare pricing, costs, and \nprograms could have a significant negative impact on the overall economy, our tenants and companies in which we invest, \nand our business.\n•\nPartial or complete government shutdown resulting in temporary closures of agencies could adversely affect our tenants \n(some of which are also government agencies) and the companies in which we invest, including delays in the \ncommercialization of such companies’ products, decreased funding of research and development, or delays surrounding \napproval of budget proposals.\n•\nThe outbreak of any highly infectious or contagious disease could adversely impact our financial condition and results of \noperations, and/or that of our tenants and non-real estate investments.\nRisks related to general and other factors\n•\nSocial, political, and economic instability, unrest, significant changes, and other circumstances beyond our control, \nincluding circumstances related to changes in the U.S. political landscape, could adversely affect our business operations.\n•\nSeasonal weather conditions, climate change and severe weather, changes in the availability of transportation or labor, \nand other related factors may affect our ability to conduct business, the products and services of our tenants, or the \navailability of such products and services of our tenants and the companies in which we invest.\n•\nWe may be unable to meet our sustainability goals.\n•\nChanges in privacy and information security laws, regulations, policies, and contractual obligations related to data privacy \nand security, or our failure to comply with such requirements, could subject us to fines or penalties or increase our cost of \ndoing business, compliance risks, and potential liability and otherwise adversely affect our business or results of \noperations.\n•\nSystem failures or security incidents through cyberattacks, intrusions, or other methods could disrupt our information \ntechnology networks, enterprise applications, and related systems, cause a loss of assets or data, give rise to remediation \nor other expenses, expose us to liability under federal and state laws, and subject us to litigation and investigations, which \ncould result in substantial reputational damage and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n•\nThe enactment of legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, may adversely impact our financial condition \nand results of operations.\nWe attempt to mitigate the foregoing risks. However, if we are unable to effectively manage the impact of these and other risks, \nour ability to meet our investment objectives may be substantially impaired and any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely \naffect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, or the market \nprice of our common stock.\n9\nOperating factors\nWe may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions and successfully operate acquired properties.\n \nWe continually evaluate the market of available properties and may acquire properties when opportunities exist. Our ability to \nacquire properties on favorable terms and successfully operate them may be exposed to significant risks, including, but not limited to, \nthe following:\n•\nWe may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors with significant \ncapital, including both publicly traded REITs and institutional funds.\n•\nEven if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the \npurchase price or result in other less favorable terms.\n•\nEven if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of properties, these agreements are subject to customary conditions \nto closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction.\n•\nWe may be unable to complete an acquisition because we cannot obtain debt and/or equity financing on favorable terms \nor at all.\n•\nWe may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties.\n•\nWe may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of operating properties or \nportfolios of properties, into our existing operations.\n•\nAcquired properties may be subject to tax reassessment, which may result in higher-than-expected property tax \npayments.\n•\nMarket conditions may result in higher-than-expected vacancy rates and lower-than-expected rental rates.\n•\nWe may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to \nunknown liabilities, such as liabilities for the remediation of undisclosed environmental contamination; claims by tenants, \nvendors, or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties; and claims for indemnification by general \npartners, directors, officers, and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.\nThe realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial expectations, \nour financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the market price of our \ncommon stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nWe may suffer economic harm as a result of making unsuccessful acquisitions in new markets.\nWe may pursue selective acquisitions of properties in markets where we have not previously owned properties. These \nacquisitions may entail risks in addition to those we face in other acquisitions where we are familiar with the markets, such as the risk of \nnot correctly anticipating conditions or trends in a new market and therefore not being able to generate profit from the acquired property. \nIf this occurs, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to \nour stockholders, our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, and the market price of our common stock.\nThe acquisition or development of new properties may give rise to difficulties in predicting revenue potential.\nWe may continue to acquire additional properties and/or land and may seek to develop our existing land holdings strategically \nas warranted by market conditions. These acquisitions and developments could fail to perform in accordance with expectations. If we \nfail to accurately estimate occupancy levels, rental rates, lease commencement dates, operating costs, or costs of improvements to \nbring an acquired property or a development property up to the standards established for our intended market position, the performance \nof the property may be below expectations. Acquired properties may have characteristics or deficiencies affecting their valuation or \nrevenue potential that we have not yet discovered. We cannot assure our stockholders that the performance of properties acquired or \ndeveloped by us will increase or be maintained under our management.\nWe may fail to achieve the financial results expected from development or redevelopment projects.\nThere are significant risks associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, but not limited to, the following \npossibilities:\n•\nWe may not complete development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts.\n•\nWe may be unable to lease development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within projected amounts.\n•\nWe may encounter project delays or cancellations due to unavailability of necessary labor and construction materials.\n•\nWe may expend funds on, and devote management’s time to, development and redevelopment projects that we may not \ncomplete.\n•\nWe may abandon development or redevelopment projects after we begin to explore them, and as a result, we may lose \ndeposits or fail to recover costs already incurred.\n•\nMarket and economic conditions may deteriorate, which can result in lower-than-expected rental rates.\n10\n•\nWe may face higher operating costs than we anticipated for development or redevelopment projects, including insurance \npremiums, utilities, security, real estate taxes, and costs of complying with changes in government regulations or \nincreases in tariffs.\n•\nWe may face higher requirements for capital improvements than we anticipated for development or redevelopment \nprojects, particularly in older structures.\n•\nWe may be unable to proceed with development or redevelopment projects because we cannot obtain debt and/or equity \nfinancing on favorable terms or at all.\n•\nWe may fail to retain tenants that have pre-leased our development or redevelopment projects if we do not complete the \nconstruction of these properties in a timely manner or to the tenants’ specifications.\n•\nTenants that have pre-leased our development or redevelopment projects may file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, or \notherwise elect to terminate their lease prior to delivery, which may adversely affect the income produced by, and the \nvalue of, our properties or require us to change the scope of the project, which may potentially result in higher construction \ncosts, significant project delays, or lower financial returns.\n•\nWe may encounter delays, refusals, unforeseen cost increases, and other impairments resulting from third-party litigation, \nnatural disasters, or severe weather conditions.\n•\nWe may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, and other required \ngovernment permits and authorizations.\n•\nWe may be unable to proceed with our development or redevelopment projects as anticipated due to changing zoning, \nland use, building, occupancy, or other government codes or regulations.\n•\nDevelopment or redevelopment projects may have defects we do not discover through our inspection processes, including \nlatent defects that may not reveal themselves until many years after we put a property in service.\nThe realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial expectations, \nour financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the market price of our \ncommon stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nWe may face increased risks and costs associated with volatility in commodity and labor prices or as a result of \nsupply chain or procurement disruptions, which may adversely affect the status of and returns on our construction projects.\nThe price of commodities and skilled labor for our construction projects may increase unpredictably due to external factors, \nincluding, but not limited to, performance of third-party suppliers and contractors; overall market supply and demand; inflationary \npricing; government regulation; international trade; and changes in general business, economic, or political conditions. As a result, the \ncosts of raw construction materials and skilled labor required for the completion of our development and redevelopment projects may \nfluctuate significantly from time to time.\nWe rely on a number of third-party suppliers and contractors to supply raw materials and skilled labor for our construction \nprojects. We believe we have favorable relationships with our suppliers and contractors. We have not encountered significant difficulty \ncollaborating with our suppliers and contractors and obtaining materials and skilled labor, nor experienced significant delays due to \ndisputes, work stoppages, or contractors’ misconduct or failure to perform. While we do not rely on any single supplier or vendor for the \nmajority of our materials and skilled labor, we may experience difficulties obtaining necessary materials from suppliers or vendors \nwhose supply chains might become impacted by economic or political changes, or difficulties obtaining adequate skilled labor from \nthird-party contractors in a tightening labor market. It is uncertain whether we would be able to source the essential commodities, \nsupplies, materials, and skilled labor timely or at all without incurring significant costs or delays, particularly during times of economic \nuncertainty resulting from events outside of our control. We may be forced to purchase supplies and materials in larger quantities or in \nadvance of when we would typically purchase them. This may cause us to require use of capital sooner than anticipated. Alternatively, \nwe may also be forced to seek new third-party suppliers or contractors, whom we have not worked with in the past, and it is uncertain \nwhether these new suppliers will be able to adequately meet our materials or labor needs. Our dependence on unfamiliar supply chains \nor relatively small supply partners may adversely affect the cost and timely completion of our construction projects. In addition, we may \nbe unable to compete with entities that may have more favorable relationships with their suppliers and contractors or greater access to \nthe required construction materials and skilled labor.\nIn addition, new climate change-related initiatives entered into by the U.S. government in collaboration with partner countries \nthrough global climate agreements may impose stricter requirements for building materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, which \ncould significantly increase our construction costs if the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap-\nand-trade or similar regulations or requirements, and the costs of which are passed onto customers like us. As a result of the factors \ndiscussed above, we may be unable to complete our development or redevelopment projects timely and/or within our budget, which \nmay affect our ability to lease space to potential tenants and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n11\nIf we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers and contractors, the \nquality and status of our construction projects may be adversely affected.\nWe believe we have favorable relationships with our existing suppliers and contractors, and we generally have not \nencountered difficulty collaborating with and obtaining materials and skilled labor, nor experienced significant delays or increases in \noverall project costs due to disputes, work stoppages, or contractors’ misconduct or failure to perform. However, it is possible we may \nexperience these events in the future, or our existing suppliers and contractors may encounter supply chain disruptions from time to \ntime that hinder their ability to supply necessary materials and labor to us. As a result, we may be forced to seek new resources for our \nconstruction needs. We may become reliant on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners, which may cause \nuncertainty in the quality, cost, and timely completion of our construction projects.\nOur ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient network of qualified suppliers who can adequately \nmeet our construction timing and quality standards can be a significant challenge, particularly in the event of global supply chain \ndisruptions. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of suppliers and contractors who can appropriately \naddress our construction needs, we may experience disruptions in our suppliers’ logistics or supply chain networks or information \ntechnology systems, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control. If we are unable to access materials and labor to complete \nour construction projects within our expected budgets and meet our tenants’ demands and expectations in a timely and efficient \nmanner, our results of operations, cash flows, and reputation may be adversely impacted. \nOur tenants may face increased risks and costs associated with volatility in commodity and labor prices or the prices \nor availability of specialized materials or equipment, or as a result of supply chain or procurement disruptions of such items, \nwhich may adversely affect their businesses or financial condition.\nOur tenants are generally subject to the same generalized risks of commodity and labor price increases and supply chain or \nprocurement as we and many other companies are. A number of our tenants, however, are also involved in highly specialized research \nor manufacturing activities that may require unique or custom chemical or biologic materials or sophisticated specialty equipment that is \nnot widely available and therefore may be particularly susceptible to supply chain disruption. In addition, these tenants may have \ncomplex supply chains due to their specialized activities that are subject to stringent government regulations, which may further hinder \ntheir access to necessary materials and equipment. While we are not aware of such issues materially affecting our tenants to date, it is \npossible that these issues may affect our tenants adversely in the future.\nWe could default on leases for land on which some of our properties are located or held for future development.\nIf we default under the terms of a ground lease obligation, we may lose the ownership rights to the property subject to the \nlease. Prior to the expiration of a ground lease and all of its options, we may not be able to renegotiate a new lease on favorable terms, \nif at all. The loss of the ownership rights to these properties or an increase in rental expense could have a material adverse effect on our \nfinancial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to \nour stockholders, as well as the market price of our common stock. Refer to “\nGround lease obligations\n” under “\nItem 7. Management’s \ndiscussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n” in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information on \nour ground lease obligations.\nWe may not be able to operate properties successfully and profitably.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability to operate our properties successfully. If we are unable to do so, our \nbusiness could be adversely affected. The ownership and operation of real estate is subject to many risks that may adversely affect our \nbusiness and our ability to make payments to our stockholders, including, but not limited to, the following risks:\n•\nOur properties may not perform as we expect.\n•\nWe may have to lease space at rates below our expectations.\n•\nWe may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms.\n•\nWe may not be able to acquire or sell properties when desired or needed due to the illiquid nature of real estate assets.\n•\nWe may underestimate the cost of improvements required to maintain or improve space to meet standards established for \nthe market position intended for that property.\n•\nWe may not be able to complete improvements required to maintain or improve space due to unanticipated delays, \nsignificant cost increases by our vendors, or cancellation of construction resulting from shortages in the supply of \nnecessary construction materials.\nThe realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial expectations, \nour financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the market price of our \ncommon stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\n12\nWe may experience increased operating costs, which may reduce profitability to the extent that we are unable to pass \nthose costs through to our tenants.\nOur properties are subject to increases in operating expenses, including insurance, property taxes, utilities, administrative \ncosts, and other costs associated with security, landscaping, and repairs and maintenance of our properties. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \napproximately \n92%\n \nof our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially \nall real estate and other rent-related taxes, insurance, utilities, security, common area expenses, and other operating expenses \n(including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. \nOur operating expenses may increase as a result of tax reassessments that our properties are subject to on a regular basis \n(annually, triennially, etc.), which may result in increases in property taxes as property values increase over time. In California, however, \npursuant to the existing state law commonly referred to as Proposition 13, properties are generally reassessed to market value at the \ntime of change in ownership or completion of construction; thereafter, annual property reassessments are limited to 2% of previously \nassessed values. As a result, Proposition 13 generally results in significant below-market assessed values over time. From time to time, \nlawmakers and political coalitions initiate efforts to repeal or amend Proposition 13 to eliminate its application to commercial and \nindustrial properties, which, if successful, may prohibit or limit the passing of increased property tax assessments onto tenants.\nOur triple net leases allow us to pass through, among other costs, substantially all real estate and rent-related taxes to our \ntenants in the form of tenant recoveries. Consequently, as a result of our triple net leases, we do not expect potential increases on \nproperty taxes as a result of tax reassessments to significantly impact our operating results. We cannot be certain, however, that we will \nbe able to continue to negotiate pass-through provisions related to taxes in tenant leases in the future, or that higher pass-through \nexpenses will not lead to lower base rents in the long run as a result of tenants’ not being able to absorb higher overall occupancy \ncosts. Thus, the repeal of or amendment to Proposition 13 could lead to a decrease in our income from rentals over time. If our \noperating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish. In addition, we cannot be \ncertain that increased costs will not lead our current or prospective tenants to seek space outside of the state of California, which could \nsignificantly hinder our ability to increase our rents or to maintain existing occupancy levels. The repeal of or amendment to Proposition \n13 in California may significantly increase occupancy costs for some of our tenants and may adversely impact their financial condition, \nability to make rental payments, and ability to renew lease agreements, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition, \nresults of operations, and cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nIn addition, compliance with various laws passed in California and other states in which we conduct business may result in \ncost increases due to new constraints on our business and the effects of potential non-compliance by us or third-party service \nproviders. Any changes in connection with compliance could be time consuming and expensive, while failure to timely implement \nrequired changes could subject us to liability for non-compliance, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, \nand financial condition.\nMost of our costs, such as operating and general and administrative expenses, interest expense, and real estate \nacquisition and construction costs, are subject to inflation. \nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, approximately \n97%\n \nof our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) contained effective annual \nrent escalations approximating\n \n3%\n \nthat were either fixed or indexed based on the CPI or another index. We have long-term lease \nagreements with our tenants, of which\n \n3%\n–\n11%\n (based on occupied RSF)\n expire each year. We believe that these annual lease \nexpirations allow us to reset these leases to market rents upon renewal or re-leasing and that annual rent escalations within our long-\nterm leases are generally sufficient to offset the effect of inflation on non-recoverable costs, such as general and administrative and \ninterest expenses. However, during inflationary periods in which the inflation rate exceeds the annual rent escalation percentages within \nour lease contracts, these rate escalations or the resetting of rents from our renewal and re-leasing activities may not adequately offset \nthe impact of inflation. \nOur operating expenses are incurred in connection with, among others, property-related contracted services such as janitorial \nand engineering services, utilities, security, repairs and maintenance, and insurance. Property taxes are also impacted by inflationary \nchanges as taxes are regularly reassessed based on changes in the fair value of our properties located outside of California. As \ndiscussed previously, in California, property taxes are not reassessed based on changes in the fair value of the underlying real estate \nasset but are instead limited to a maximum 2% annual increase by law.\nOur operating expenses, with the exception of ground lease rental expenses, are typically recoverable through our lease \narrangements, which allow us to pass through substantially all expenses associated with property taxes, insurance, utilities, security, \nrepairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) to our tenants. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \napproximately \n92%\n of our existing leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which allow us to recover \noperating expenses, and approximately \n92%\n o\nf our existing leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) also provided for the recapture \nof capital expenditures. Our remaining leases are generally gross leases, which provide for recoveries of operating expenses above the \noperating expenses from the initial year within each lease. \n13\nDue to our ability to largely recover increases in operating expenses from our triple net leases, inflation typically does not have \na significant adverse effect on our net operating income, results of operations, and operating cash flows at the property level. However, \nthere is no guarantee that our tenants would be able to absorb these expense increases and to continue to pay us their portion of \noperating expenses, capital expenditures, and rent, or to be able to continue operating their businesses or conducting research and \ndevelopment activities altogether. Alternatively, our tenants may decide to relocate to areas with lower rent and operating expenses \nwhere we may not currently own properties, and, as a result, our tenants may cease leasing properties from us. \nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs, technology services, and professional \nservice fees. Annually, our employee compensation is adjusted to reflect merit increases; however, to maintain our ability to successfully \ncompete for the best talent, especially in a talent shortage environment, rising inflation rates may require us to provide compensation \nincreases beyond historical annual merit increases, which may unexpectedly and/or significantly increase our compensation costs. \nSimilarly, technology services and professional service fees are also subject to the impact of inflation and generally increase \nproportionately with increasing market prices for such services. Consequently, inflation may increase our general and administrative \nexpenses over time.\nDuring inflationary periods, interest rates have historically increased. For instance, to control the rate of inflation, the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (the “U.S. Federal Reserve”) raised its benchmark federal funds rate from nearly zero in \nMarch 2022 to a range between\n \n4.25%\n and \n4.50%\n a\ns of December 31, 2024. Although there are expectations that the U.S. Federal \nReserve will be reducing the federal funds rate in 2025, these expectations might not materialize. Interest rates at elevated levels could \nincrease our financing costs over time, either through near-term borrowings on our variable-rate unsecured senior line of credit and \ncommercial paper program, refinancing of our existing borrowings, or the issuance of new debt. In addition, elevated market interest \nrates may result in a decrease in the value of our real estate and could also adversely affect the securities markets in general, which \ncould impact the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. Any such unfavorable changes to our \nborrowing costs and stock price could significantly impact our ability to raise new debt and equity capital going forward.\nAdditionally, inflationary pricing may increase the construction costs necessary to complete our development and \nredevelopment projects, including, but not limited to, costs of construction materials, labor, and services from third-party contractors and \nsuppliers. Certain increases in the costs of construction materials, however, can often be managed in our development and \nredevelopment projects through either (i) general budget contingencies built into our overall construction costs estimates for each of our \nprojects or (ii) guaranteed maximum price construction contracts, which stipulate a maximum price for certain construction costs and \nshift inflation risk to our construction general contractors. However, it is not guaranteed that our budget contingencies would accurately \naccount for potential construction cost increases. Nor is it guaranteed that our general contractors would be able to absorb such \nincreases in costs and complete our construction projects timely, within budget, or at all.\n We rely on a number of third-party suppliers and contractors to supply raw materials, skilled labor, and services for our \nconstruction projects. We have not encountered significant difficulty collaborating with these third-party suppliers and contractors and \nobtaining materials and skilled labor, nor experienced significant delays or increases in overall project costs due to the factors \ndiscussed above. While we do not rely on any single supplier or vendor for the majority of our materials and skilled labor, we may \nexperience difficulties obtaining necessary materials from suppliers or vendors whose supply chains might become impacted by \neconomic or political changes, outmoded technology, aging infrastructure, shortages of shipping containers and/or means of \ntransportation, or difficulties obtaining adequate skilled labor from third-party contractors. It is uncertain whether we would be able to \ncontinue to source the essential commodities, supplies, materials, and skilled labor timely or at all without incurring significant costs or \ndelays, particularly during times of economic uncertainty resulting from events outside of our control. Higher construction costs could \nadversely impact our net investments in real estate and expected yields on our development and redevelopment projects, which may \nmake otherwise lucrative investment opportunities less profitable to us. \nHistorically, during periods of increasing interest rates, real estate valuations have generally decreased as a result of rising \ncapitalization rates which tend to move directionally with interest rates. Consequently, prolonged periods of higher interest rates may \nnegatively impact the valuation of our real estate asset portfolio and lead to higher cost of capital and/or lower sales proceeds from \nfuture real estate dispositions.\nThe realization of any of the aforementioned risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash \nflows, our stock price and market capitalization, as well as our ability to pay dividends.\nThe cost of maintaining the quality of our properties may be higher than anticipated, which can result in reduced \ncash flows and profitability.\nIf our properties are not as attractive to current and prospective tenants in terms of rent, services, condition, or location as \nproperties owned by our competitors, we\n \ncould lose tenants or suffer lower rental rates. As a result, we may, from time to time, be \nrequired to make significant capital expenditures to maintain the competitiveness of our\n \nproperties. However, there can be no \nassurances that any such expenditures would result in higher occupancy or higher rental rates or deter existing tenants from relocating \nto properties\n \nowned by our competitors.\n14\nOur inability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire may significantly affect our \nbusiness.\nOur revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If our \ntenants experience a downturn in their business or other types of financial distress, they may be unable to make timely payments under \ntheir leases. In addition, because of the impact to the business environment due to civil unrest, high cost of living, taxes, and other \nincreased region-specific costs of doing business in certain of our markets and submarkets, such as those located in the states of \nCalifornia and Washington, tenants may choose not to renew or re-lease space. Also, if our tenants terminate early or decide not to \nrenew their leases, we may not be able to re-lease the space. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease space, the terms of renewals or \nnew leases, including the cost of any tenant improvements, concessions, and lease commissions, may be less favorable to us than \ncurrent lease terms. Consequently, we could generate less cash flows from the affected properties than expected, which could \nnegatively impact our business. We may have to divert cash flows generated by other properties to meet our debt service payments, if \nany, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected properties.\nThe inability of a tenant to pay us rent could adversely affect our business.\nOur revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If our \ntenants, especially significant tenants, fail to make rental payments under their leases, our financial condition, cash flows, and ability to \nmake distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. Additionally, the inability of the U.S. Congress to enact a budget for \na fiscal year or the occurrence of partial or complete U.S. government shutdowns may result in financial difficulties for tenants that are \ndependent on federal funding, which could adversely affect the ability of those tenants to pay us rent.\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a property. If any of our \ntenants becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as amended, we cannot evict that tenant solely because of its \nbankruptcy. The bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against such a tenant for \nuncollectible future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed \nto us under the tenant’s lease. Any shortfall in rental payments could adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to make \ndistributions to our stockholders.\nWe could be held liable for damages resulting from our tenants’ use of hazardous materials.\nMany of our tenants engage in research and development activities that involve controlled use of hazardous materials, \nchemicals, and biologic and radioactive compounds. In the event of contamination or injury from the use of these hazardous materials, \nwe could be held liable for damages that result. This liability could exceed our resources and any recovery available through any \napplicable insurance coverage, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nTogether with our tenants, we must comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, \nstorage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or \nchanges thereto, could adversely affect our business or our tenants’ businesses and their ability to make rental payments to us.\nOur properties may have defects that are unknown to us.\nAlthough we thoroughly review the physical condition of our properties before they are acquired, and as they are developed or \nredeveloped, any of our properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us that could adversely affect the property’s \nvalue or revenue potential.\nOur properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues, which could lead to \nliability for adverse health effects and costs to remedy the problem.\nWhen excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold may grow, particularly if the moisture \nproblem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor \nair quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other \nbiological contaminants such as pollen, viruses, and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels may \ncause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant \nmold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or \nremove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of \nsignificant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants, and others if \nproperty damage or health concerns arise.\n15\nWe may not be able to obtain additional capital to further our business objectives.\nOur ability to acquire, develop, or redevelop properties depends upon our ability to obtain capital. The real estate industry has \nhistorically experienced periods of volatile debt and equity capital markets and/or periods of extreme illiquidity. A prolonged period in \nwhich we cannot effectively access the public debt and/or equity markets may result in heavier reliance on alternative financing sources \nsuch as dispositions and partial interest sales to undertake new investments. An inability to obtain debt and/or equity capital on \nacceptable terms could delay or prevent us from acquiring, financing, and completing desirable investments and could otherwise \nadversely affect our business. Also, the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or interests in subsidiaries to fund future \noperations could dilute the ownership of our then-existing stockholders. Even as liquidity returns to the market, debt and equity capital \nmay be more expensive than in prior years.\nWe may not be able to sell our properties quickly to raise capital.\nInvestments in real estate are relatively illiquid compared to other investments. Accordingly, we may not be able to sell our \nproperties when we desire or at prices acceptable to us in response to changes in macroeconomic or other conditions. In addition, \ncertain of our properties have low tax bases relative to their estimated current market values. As such, the sale of these assets would \ngenerate significant taxable gains that may increase our REIT distribution requirement unless we sold such properties in a qualifying \ntax-deferred exchange under Section 1031 (“Section 1031 Exchange”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \n“Internal Revenue Code”), or in a similar tax-free or tax-deferred transaction or applied an offsetting tax deduction. For a sale to qualify \nfor tax-deferred treatment under Section 1031, net proceeds from the sale of a property must be held by a third-party escrow agent until \napplied toward the purchase of a qualifying real estate asset. It is possible we may encounter delays in reinvesting such proceeds, or \nwe may be unable to reinvest such proceeds at all, due to an inability to procure qualifying real estate. Any delay or limitation in using \nthe reinvestment proceeds to acquire additional real estate assets may cause the reinvestment proceeds to become taxable to us. \nFurthermore, if current laws applicable to such tax-deferred transactions are later amended or repealed, we may no longer be able to \nsell properties on a tax-deferred basis, which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell properties held for less than two years. These limitations on our \nability to sell our properties may adversely affect our cash flows, our ability to repay debt, and our ability to make distributions to our \nstockholders.\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing ability.\nOur credit ratings may affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. \nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and/or improve our current credit ratings. In the event that our current credit \nratings are downgraded or removed, we would most likely incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty in obtaining \nadditional financing, which in turn would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, \nand liquidity.\nWe may not be able to refinance our debt, and/or our debt may not be assumable.\nThe real estate industry may require more funds to refinance debt maturities than are available from lenders. This potential \nshortage of available funds from lenders and stricter credit underwriting guidelines may limit our ability to refinance our debt as it \nmatures or may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our \nstockholders, and the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to borrow additional amounts through the issuance of unsecured bonds or under our unsecured \nsenior line of credit or commercial paper program.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to continue to access the unsecured bond market on favorable terms. Our ability to \nborrow additional amounts through the issuance of unsecured bonds may be negatively impacted by periods of illiquidity in the bond \nmarket. \nAggregate borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit require compliance with certain financial and non-financial \ncovenants. Borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit are funded by a group of banks. Our ability to borrow additional \namounts under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program may be negatively impacted by a decrease in cash \nflows from our properties, a default or cross-default under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program, non-\ncompliance with one or more loan covenants associated with our unsecured senior line of credit, and non-performance or failure of one \nor more lenders under our unsecured senior line of credit. In addition, we may not be able to refinance or repay outstanding borrowings \non our unsecured senior line of credit or commercial paper program.\n16\nOur inability to borrow additional amounts on an unsecured basis could delay us in or prevent us from acquiring, financing, and \ncompleting desirable investments, which could adversely affect our business; and our inability to refinance or repay amounts under our \nunsecured senior line of credit or commercial paper program may adversely affect our cash flows, ability to make distributions to our \nstockholders, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur unsecured senior line of credit restricts our ability to engage in some business activities.\nOur unsecured senior line of credit contains customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that, \namong other things:\n•\nRestrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness;\n•\nRestrict our ability to make certain investments;\n•\nRestrict our ability to merge with another company;\n•\nRestrict our ability to make distributions to our stockholders;\n•\nRequire us to maintain financial coverage ratios; and\n•\nRequire us to maintain a pool of qualified unencumbered assets.\nComplying with these restrictions may prevent us from engaging in certain profitable activities and/or constrain our ability to \neffectively allocate capital. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in our defaulting on these and other loans, which would \nlikely have a negative impact on our operations, financial condition, and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nOur debt service obligations may have adverse consequences on our business operations.\nWe use debt to finance our operations, including the acquisition, development, and redevelopment of properties. Our use of \ndebt may have adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:\n•\nOur cash flows from operations may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.\n•\nWe may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms, to make payments on \nour debt.\n•\nIf we default on our secured debt obligations, the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure \nthose loans.\n•\nA foreclosure on one of our properties could create taxable income without any accompanying cash proceeds to pay the \ntax.\n•\nA default under a loan that has cross-default provisions may cause us to automatically default on another loan.\n•\nWe may not be able to refinance or extend our existing debt.\n•\nThe terms of any refinancing or extension may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt.\n•\nWe may be subject to a significant increase in the variable interest rates on our unsecured senior line of credit, secured \nconstruction loan, or commercial paper program, which could adversely impact our cash flows and operations.\n•\nThe terms of our debt obligations may require a reduction in our distributions to stockholders.\nIf our expenses exceed our revenues, we may have to borrow additional funds, and we may not be able to make \ndistributions to our stockholders.\nIf our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to cover our operating expenses, including our debt service obligations \nand capital expenditures, we may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs and cash flow needs. This could adversely \naffect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Factors that could adversely affect the revenues we generate from, and the \nvalues of, our properties include, but are not limited to:\n•\nNational, local, and worldwide economic and political conditions;\n•\nCompetition from other properties;\n•\nChanges in the life science industry;\n•\nReal estate conditions in our target markets;\n•\nOur ability to collect rental payments;\n•\nThe availability of financing;\n•\nChanges to the financial and banking industries;\n•\nChanges in interest rate levels;\n•\nVacancies at our properties and our ability to re-lease space;\n•\nChanges in tax or other regulatory laws;\n•\nThe costs of compliance with government regulation;\n•\nThe lack of liquidity of real estate investments; \n•\nIncreases in operating costs; and\n•\nIncreases in costs to address environmental impacts related to climate change or natural disasters.\n17\nIn addition, if a lease at a property is not a triple net lease, we will have greater exposure to increases in expenses associated \nwith operating that property. Certain significant expenditures, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, insurance, and \nmaintenance costs, are generally fixed and do not decrease when revenues at the related property decrease.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our debt obligations, we could become highly leveraged, and our debt service \nobligations could increase to unsustainable levels.\nOur organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. Therefore, if we fail to prudently manage our \ncapital structure, we could become highly leveraged. This would result in an increase in our debt service obligations that could \nadversely affect our cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Higher leverage could also increase the risk of \ndefault on our debt obligations or may result in downgrades to our credit ratings.\nFailure to meet market expectations for our financial performance would likely adversely affect the market price and \nvolatility of our stock.\nOur actual financial results may differ materially from expectations and/or the guidance we provide. This may be a result of \nvarious factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nThe status of the economy;\n•\nThe status of capital markets, including availability and cost of capital;\n•\nChanges in financing terms available to us;\n•\nNegative developments in the operating results or financial condition of tenants, including, but not limited to, their ability to \npay rent;\n•\nOur ability to re-lease space at similar rates as leases expire;\n•\nOur ability to reinvest sale proceeds in a timely manner at rates similar to the rate at which assets are sold;\n•\nOur ability to successfully complete developments or redevelopments of properties for lease on time and/or within budget;\n•\nOur ability to procure third-party suppliers or providers of necessary construction materials for our developments and \nredevelopments of properties;\n•\nRegulatory approval and market acceptance of the products and technologies of tenants;\n•\nLiability or contract claims by or against tenants;\n•\nUnanticipated difficulties and/or expenditures relating to future acquisitions;\n•\nEnvironmental laws affecting our properties;\n•\nChanges in rules or practices governing our financial reporting; and\n•\nOther legal and operational matters, including REIT qualification and key management personnel recruitment and \nretention.\nFailure to meet market expectations, particularly with respect to earnings estimates, funds from operations per share, \noperating cash flows, and revenues, would likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our common stock \nor other outstanding securities.\nThe price per share of our stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price per share of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, many of which \nare beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n•\nThe availability and cost of debt and/or equity capital;\n•\nThe condition of our balance sheet;\n•\nActual or anticipated capital requirements;\n•\nThe condition of the financial and banking industries;\n•\nActual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends;\n•\nThe amount and timing of debt maturities and other contractual obligations;\n•\nChanges in our net income, funds from operations, or guidance;\n•\nThe publication of research reports and articles (or false or misleading information) about us, our tenants, the real estate \nindustry, or the life science industry;\n•\nThe general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other debt or equity \nsecurities (including securities issued by other real estate-based companies);\n•\nGeneral stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed-income securities, that may lead \nprospective stockholders to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends;\n•\nChanges in our analyst ratings;\n•\nChanges in our corporate credit ratings or credit ratings of our debt or other securities;\n•\nChanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n•\nAdverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur or equity we raise in the future;\n•\nAdditions, departures, or other announcements regarding our key management personnel and/or the Board of Directors;\n18\n•\nActions by institutional stockholders;\n•\nSpeculation in the press or investment community;\n•\nShort selling of our common stock or related derivative securities; \n•\nThe publication or dissemination of opinions, characterizations, or disinformation that are intended to create negative \nmarket momentum, including through the use of social media;\n•\nRisks associated with generative artificial intelligence tools and large language models and the conclusions that these \ntools and models may draw about our business and prospects in connection with the dissemination of negative opinions, \ncharacterizations, or disinformation;\n•\nTerrorist activity adversely affecting the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and \ncausing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending;\n•\nGovernment regulatory action and changes in tax laws;\n•\nFiscal policies or inaction at the U.S. federal government level that may lead to federal government shutdowns or negative \nimpacts on the U.S. economy;\n•\nFluctuations due to general market volatility;\n•\nDisruptions in the banking sector or failures of financial institutions that we or our tenants may or may not have business \nrelationships with;\n•\nGlobal market factors adversely affecting the U.S. economic and political environment;\n•\nGeneral market and economic conditions; and\n•\nThe realization of any of the other risk factors included in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThese factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, \nresults of operations, business, or prospects.\nPossible future sales of shares of our common stock could adversely affect its market price.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of shares of our common stock or the market price of our common stock. \nSales of substantial amounts of capital stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market \nprice for our common stock. Refer to “\nOther sources\n” under “\nItem 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and \nresults of operations\n” in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe have reserved a number of shares of common stock for issuance to our directors, officers, and employees pursuant to our \nAmended and Restated 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (sometimes referred to herein as our “equity incentive plan”). We have \nfiled a registration statement with respect to the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to grants under our equity incentive \nplan. In addition, any shares issued under our equity incentive plan will be available for sale in the public market from time to time \nwithout restriction by persons who are not our “affiliates” (as defined in Rule 144 adopted under the Securities Act of 1933, as \namended). Affiliates will be able to sell shares of our common stock subject to restrictions under Rule 144.\nOur distributions to stockholders may decline at any time.\nWe may not continue our current level of distributions to our stockholders. Our Board of Directors will determine future \ndistributions based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nThe amount of net cash provided by operating activities available for distribution;\n•\nOur financial condition and capital requirements;\n•\nAny decision to reinvest funds rather than to distribute such funds;\n•\nOur capital expenditures;\n•\nThe annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code;\n•\nRestrictions under Maryland law; and\n•\nOther factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nA reduction in distributions to stockholders may negatively impact our stock price.\n19\nDistributions on our common stock may be made in the form of cash, stock, or a combination of both.\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders. Typically, we generate cash for \ndistributions through our operations, the disposition of assets, including partial interest sales, or the incurrence of additional debt. Our \nBoard of Directors may determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock in cash, in shares of our common stock, or in a \ncombination of cash and shares of our common stock. For example, we may declare dividends payable in cash or stock at the election \nof each stockholder, subject to a limit on the aggregate cash that could be paid. Any such dividends would be distributed in a manner \nintended to count in full toward the satisfaction of our annual distribution requirements and to qualify for the dividends paid deduction. \nWhile the IRS privately has ruled that such a dividend would so qualify if certain requirements are met, no assurances can be provided \nthat the IRS would not assert a contrary position in the future. Moreover, a reduction in the cash yield on our common stock may \nnegatively impact our stock price.\nWe have certain ownership interests outside the U.S. that may subject us to risks different from or greater than those \nassociated with our domestic operations.\nWe have a small portfolio of operating properties outside the U.S., primarily in Canada. Acquisition, development, \nredevelopment, ownership, and operating activities outside the U.S. involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to \nour domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n•\nAdverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;\n•\nChallenges and/or taxation with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings or repatriation of proceeds from the sale of \none or more of our foreign investments;\n•\nChanges in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions, including nationally, regionally, and locally;\n•\nChallenges in managing international operations;\n•\nChallenges in hiring or retaining key management personnel;\n•\nChallenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, \ncorporate governance, operations, taxes, employment, data privacy and security, and legal proceedings;\n•\nDifferences in lending practices;\n•\nDifferences in languages, cultures, and time zones; \n•\nChanges in applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. that affect foreign operations;\n•\nChallenges in managing foreign relations and trade disputes that adversely affect U.S. and foreign operations;\n•\nPartial or complete U.S. federal government shutdowns, trade disagreements with other countries, or uncertainties that \ncould affect business transactions within the U.S. and with foreign entities;\n•\nChanges in tax and local regulations with potentially adverse tax consequences and penalties; and\n•\nForeign ownership and transfer restrictions.\nIn addition, our foreign investments are subject to taxation in foreign jurisdictions based on local tax laws and regulations and \non existing international tax treaties. We invest in foreign markets under the assumption that our future earnings there will be taxed at \nthe current prevailing income tax rates. There are no guarantees that foreign governments will continue to honor existing tax treaties we \nhave relied upon for our foreign investments or that the current income tax rates in those markets will not increase significantly, thus \nimpacting our ability to repatriate our foreign investments and related earnings. Moreover, any international currency gain recognized \nwith respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under gross income tests that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify \nand maintain our status as a REIT.\nInvestments in international markets may also subject us to risks associated with establishing effective controls and \nprocedures to regulate the operations in foreign locations and to monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations, including the \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar applicable anti-\ncorruption laws prohibit individuals and entities from offering, promising, authorizing, or providing payments or anything of value, directly \nor indirectly, to government officials in order to obtain, retain, or direct business. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to \ncivil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect our results of operations or the value of our international investments. \nIn addition, if we fail to effectively manage our international operations, our overall financial condition, results of operations, and cash \nflows, and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, we may in the future enter into agreements with foreign entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject \nto dispute resolution rules of, another country or region. In some cases, such a country or region might not have a forum that provides \nus an effective or efficient means for resolving disputes that may arise under these agreements.\n20\nWe are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties owned through partnerships, limited liability \ncompanies, and joint ventures.\nOur organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in non-wholly owned partnerships, limited \nliability companies, or joint ventures. Partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture investments involve certain risks, including, \nbut not limited to, the following:\n•\nUpon bankruptcy of non-wholly owned partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint venture entities, we may become \nliable for the liabilities of the partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture;\n•\nWe may share certain approval rights over major decisions with third parties;\n•\nOur partners may file for bankruptcy protection or otherwise fail to fund their share of required capital contributions;\n•\nOur partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or \ngoals and that could affect our ability to lease or re-lease the property, operate the property, or maintain our qualification \nas a REIT;\n•\nOur partners may have banking or financial relationships with institutions that become insolvent or otherwise fail, which \ncould affect our access to capital;\n•\nOur ability to sell the interest on advantageous terms when we so desire may be limited or restricted under the terms of \nour agreements with our partners; and\n•\nWe may not continue to own or operate the interests or assets underlying such relationships or may need to purchase \nsuch interests or assets at an above-market price to continue ownership.\nIn addition, in some of our real estate joint ventures, predominantly consolidated, our partners hold contractual rights that allow \nthem to sell their interests, initiate a buy/sell process, or force the sale of a property. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the aggregate \nnoncontrolling interest balance in our consolidated balance sheet is \n$4.5 billion\n. In \nsix\n consolidated joint ventures with aggregate \nnoncontrolling interests of approximately\n \n$1.0 billion\n, our partners currently have the ability to exercise these rights. In \n23\n other \nconsolidated real estate joint ventures\n with aggregate noncontrolling interests of approximately \n$3.0 billion\n, these rights become \nexercisable upon the expiration of respective lockout provisions during \n2025\n through \n2031\n. \nIf a joint venture partner elects to sell their interest, we have the right of first refusal to acquire the partner’s interest at the \npartner’s specified price. If we decline, the partner has the right to sell to a third party with minimal to no input from us. Alternatively, \nsome agreements allow the partner to force a sale of the underlying property. In such cases, we typically have a right of first offer. \nHowever, if we choose not to proceed, the property may be sold to a third party under terms that are outside of our control. A price \noffered to the third party is generally subject to certain limitations, and if it falls below a specified threshold, the partner must offer the \nreduced price to us before proceeding. \nThe risks noted above could negatively impact us or may require us to: \n•\nSell the underlying asset subject to our interest in the joint venture when we otherwise would not;\n•\nReallocate existing capital or seek new funding in order to maintain an ownership interest in or control of an asset, \npotentially straining our liquidity position and/or diluting earnings per share;\n•\nContribute additional capital if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions or are unable to \naccess capital as a result of their financial distress or disruptions in the banking sector;\n•\nExperience substantial unanticipated delays that could hinder either the initiation or completion of redevelopment activities \nor new construction;\n•\nIncur additional expenses or reduce revenues that could prevent the achievement of yields or returns that were initially \nanticipated;\n•\nBecome engaged in a dispute with our joint venture partner that could lead to the sale of either party’s ownership interest \nor the property at a price below estimated fair market value;\n•\nInitiate litigation or settle disagreements with our partner through litigation or arbitration; and\n•\nSuffer losses or decreased returns as a result of actions taken by our partner with respect to our joint venture investments.\nWe generally seek to maintain control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint venture investments, and \nstructure our joint venture agreements in a manner sufficient to permit us to achieve our business objectives. However, we may not be \nable to do so, and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of \noperations, and cash flows, our funds from operations per share, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, and the market \nprice of our common stock.\n21\nWe may not be able to attain the expected return on our investments in real estate joint ventures. \nWe have consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in which we share certain ownership and decision-making \npowers with one or more parties. Our joint venture partners must agree in order for the applicable joint venture to take specific major \nactions, including budget approvals, acquisitions, sales of assets, debt financing, execution of lease agreements, and vendor approvals. \nUnder these joint venture arrangements, any disagreements between our partners and us may result in delayed or unfavorable \ndecisions. Our inability to take unilateral actions that we believe are in our best interests may result in missed opportunities and an \nineffective allocation of resources and could have an adverse effect on the financial performance of our joint ventures and our operating \nresults.\nWe could incur significant costs due to the financial condition of our insurance carriers.\nWe insure our properties with insurance companies we believe have good ratings at the time our policies are put into effect. \nThe financial condition of one or more of the insurance companies we hold policies with may be negatively impacted, which can result \nin their inability to pay on future insurance claims. Their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial \nresults. In addition, the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the cost of renewing our insurance policies or \nincrease the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties.\nOur insurance may not adequately cover all potential losses\n.\nAs a part of Alexandria’s risk management program, we maintain all-risk property insurance for our portfolio to mitigate risks \nposed by extreme weather events, natural disasters (including floods, wildfires, earthquakes, and wind events), and terrorism. Our all-\nrisk property insurance currently provides \na\n \n$2.0 billion\n per occurrence li\nmit\n for our operating portfolio. However, it may not fully cover all \npotential losses. There is no assurance that we will maintain current levels of insurance coverage in the future.\nA significant portion of our real estate portfolio is located in seismically active regions, including the San Francisco Bay Area, \nSan Diego, and Seattle, and a damaging earthquake in any region could significantly impact multiple properties. For these properties, \nwe have obtained earthquake insurance in an amount and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable. For properties in \nCalifornia, coverage is \n$335 million\n, per occurrence and has an annual aggregate limit, subject to a \n5%\n deductible of the property’s \nreplacement value. For the Seattle region, the coverage is \n$200 million\n, per occurrence and has an annual aggregate limit, subject to a \n2%\n deductible. \nNevertheless, a major earthquake in any region could lead to substantial losses, potentially exceeding our insurance \ncoverage and resulting in material aggregate deductible amounts. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results \nof operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, we carry environmental and title insurance policies for our properties. We generally obtain title insurance policies \nwhen we acquire a property, with each policy covering an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property. Accordingly,  \ncurrent property values may exceed the amount covered by a related title insurance policy. \nWe regularly evaluate the insurance market, including for coverage against terrorism, earthquakes, and other catastrophic \nevents. However, we cannot predict the availability and affordability of such coverage in the future. Should the premiums for our \nearthquake and other insurance policies become prohibitively expensive or if we decide to self-insure some of our risks, we may modify \nor discontinue the coverage for some or all of our properties. \n If we experience a loss at any of our properties that is not covered by insurance, exceeds our insurance policy limits, or is \nsubject to a policy deductible, we could lose the capital invested in the affected property and, possibly, future revenues from that \nproperty. In addition, we could continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or be responsible for other obligations related to \nthe affected properties. All of our wholly owned properties, including properties partially owned through joint ventures that are managed \nby our joint venture partners, carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance.\nFor our properties in wildfire- or flood-prone areas, we are evaluating mitigation strategies and potential operational and \nphysical improvements. For example, resilience measures that may be implemented at some of our properties may include:\n•\nFire-resilience measures.\n Incorporation of brush management practices into landscape design; selection and positioning \nof less flammable vegetation species at a reasonable distance from a property; construction of building envelopes with \nfire-resistant materials; and installation of HVAC systems that are able to filter smoke particulates from the air in the event \nof a fire.\n•\nFlood-resilience measures\n. Positioning of critical building mechanical equipment on roofs or significantly above projected \npotential flood elevations; storage of temporary flood barriers on site to be deployed at building entrances in the event of a \nflood; elevation of property entrances or the first floor above projected present-day and future flood elevations; installation \nof backflow preventors on storm/sewer utilities that discharge from the building; and waterproofing of the building \nenvelope up to the projected flood elevation.\n22\nOur tenants are also required to maintain comprehensive insurance policies, including commercial general liability insurance \ntypically obtained for similar properties. However, we and our tenants do not generally insure against certain types of losses that are \neither uninsurable or prohibitively costly to insure. We cannot predict the future availability of insurance coverage against any risk of \nloss. Insurance companies may discontinue coverage for certain risks, or, if offered, such coverage may become excessively \nexpensive.\nThe loss of services of any of our executive and/or senior officers could adversely affect us.\nWe depend upon the services and contributions of relatively few executive and senior officers. The loss of services or \ncontributions of any one of them may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and prospects. We use the extensive personal \nand business relationships that members of our management have developed over time with owners of life science properties and with \nmajor tenants and venture investment portfolio companies in the life science industry. We cannot assure our stockholders that our \nexecutive and senior officers will remain employed with us. In California and certain other regions where we have operations, there is \nintense competition for individuals with skill sets needed for our business. Moreover, in California, where our headquarters and many of \nour properties are located, high state and local taxes and increased home prices contribute to the high cost of living, which may impair \nour ability to attract and retain employees locally in the future. Due to the long-term nature of our investments and properties, we are \nunable to predict and may be unable to effectively control such costs. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel and retaining \nand motivating existing personnel, our business may suffer, and we may be unable to implement our current initiatives or grow \neffectively.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.\nPursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over \nfinancial reporting, including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control. Changes to our business will \nnecessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or \ndetect misstatement because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of \ncontrols, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and \nfair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement \nrequired new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations, and \nfinancial condition could be materially harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse \neffect on the market price of our common stock.\nIf we failed to qualify as a REIT, we would be taxed at corporate rates and would not be able to take certain \ndeductions when computing our taxable income.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. If, in any taxable year, we failed to qualify as a \nREIT:\n•\nWe would be subject to federal and state income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;\n•\nWe would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to our stockholders in computing taxable income;\n•\nWe would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost \nqualification, unless we were entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code; and\n•\nWe would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make distributions to our stockholders.\nAs a result of any additional tax liability, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate certain investments in order to pay the \napplicable tax. Accordingly, funds available for investment or distribution to our stockholders would be reduced for each of the years \ninvolved.\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our \noperations and financial results, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our \ncontrol. There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. Although we believe that our current \norganization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us \nto qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure our stockholders that we are or will remain so qualified. To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a \nnumber of requirements, including those regarding the ownership of our stock and the composition of our assets and gross income. We \nmust also make distributions to stockholders aggregating at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains.\nWe currently own, and may acquire in the future, direct or indirect interests in one or more entities that have elected or may \nelect to be taxed as REITs under the Internal Revenue Code, which are subject to the various REIT qualification requirements and \nlimitations described herein. If any of these entities were to fail to qualify as a REIT, then (i) the entity would become subject to federal \nand state income taxes, (ii) shares in such an entity would cease to be qualifying assets for purposes of asset tests applicable to REITs, \nand (iii) we may fail certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs, in which event we would fail to qualify as a REIT unless we qualify for \ncertain relief provisions.\n23\nIn addition, we currently own interests in certain taxable REIT subsidiaries and may continue to acquire such interests in the \nfuture. A taxable REIT subsidiary is a corporation (or entity treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes), other than a REIT, \nthat has made a joint election with a parent REIT (which directly or indirectly owns stock in the REIT subsidiary) to be treated as a \ntaxable REIT subsidiary. The subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes as a regular C corporation and is further subject to \na 100% excise tax for certain transactions between the taxable REIT subsidiary and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm’s-\nlength basis. We intend to structure our transactions with any taxable REIT subsidiaries that we own to ensure that they are entered into \non arm’s-length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax mentioned above. However, there can be no assurance that we will be \nable to successfully structure future transactions to avoid being subject to the 100% excise tax, which may adversely impact our cash \nflows, ability to make distributions to stockholders, and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we dispose of properties in transactions qualified as Section 1031 Exchanges. If a transaction intended to \nqualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined by the IRS to be taxable or if we are unable to identify and complete the \nacquisition of a suitable replacement property to effect a Section 1031 Exchange or if the laws surrounding Section 1031 Exchanges \nare amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax-deferred basis. In such a case, our earnings and profits \nand our taxable income would increase, which could increase the dividend income and reduce the return of capital to our stockholders. \nAs a result, we may be required to pay additional dividends to stockholders, or if we do not pay additional dividends, our corporate \nincome tax liability could increase and we may be subject to interest and penalties.\nWe may not be able to participate in certain sales that the IRS characterizes as “prohibited transactions.” The tax imposed on \nREITs engaging in prohibited transactions is a 100% tax on net income from the transaction. Whether or not the transaction is \ncharacterized as a prohibited transaction is a factual matter. Generally, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of \nproperty, other than foreclosures, characterized as held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. However, a \nsale will not be considered a prohibited transaction if it meets certain safe harbor requirements. Although we do not intend to participate \nin prohibited transactions, there is no guarantee that the IRS would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will meet \nthe safe harbor requirements. \nFederal income tax rules are constantly under review by the U.S. Congress and the IRS. Changes to tax laws could adversely \naffect our investors or our tenants, and we cannot predict how those changes may affect us in the future. New legislation, U.S. Treasury \nDepartment regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as \na REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or an investment in our stock. Also, laws relating to the tax treatment \nof investment in other types of business entities could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an \ninvestment in a REIT.\nWe are dependent on third parties to manage certain amenities at our properties. \nWe retain third-party managers to manage certain amenities at our properties, such as restaurants, conference centers, \nexercise facilities, and parking garages. Our income from our properties may be adversely affected if these parties fail to provide quality \nservices and amenities with respect to our properties. While we monitor the performance of these third parties, we may have limited \nrecourse if we believe they are not performing adequately. In addition, these third-party managers may operate, and in some cases may \nown or invest in, properties or businesses that compete with our properties, which may result in conflicts of interest. As a result, these \nthird-party managers may have made, and may in the future make, decisions that are not in our best interests.\nWe rely on a limited number of vendors to provide utilities and certain other services at our properties, and disruption \nin these services may have a significant adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe rely on a limited number of vendors to provide key services, including, but not limited to, utilities, security, and construction \nservices, at certain of our properties. Our business and property operations may be adversely affected if key vendors fail to adequately \nprovide key services at our properties as a result of natural disasters (such as fires, floods, earthquakes, etc.), power interruptions, \nbankruptcies, war, acts of terrorism, public health emergencies, cyberattacks, pandemics, or other unanticipated catastrophic events. If \na vendor encounters financial difficulty such as bankruptcy or other events beyond our control that cause it to fail to adequately provide \nutilities, security, construction, or other important services, we may experience significant interruptions in service and disruptions to \nbusiness operations at our properties, incur remediation costs, and become subject to claims and damage to our reputation.  \nIn addition, difficulties encountered by key vendors in providing necessary services at our properties could result in significant \nmarket rate increases for such services. Our triple net leases allow us to pass through substantially all operating expenses and certain \ncapital expenditures to our tenants in the form of additional rent. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to \nnegotiate pass-through provisions in tenant leases in the future, which could lead to a decrease in our recovery of operating expenses. \nIf our operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish. Also, we cannot be \ncertain that increased costs will not lead our current or prospective tenants to seek space elsewhere, which could significantly hinder \nour ability to increase our rents or to maintain existing occupancy levels. Additionally, this may significantly increase occupancy costs for \nsome of our tenants and may adversely impact their financial condition, ability to make rental payments, and ability to renew their lease \nagreements.\n24\nPacific Gas and Electric Company (“PG&E”) is the primary public utility company providing electrical and gas service to \nresidential and commercial customers in northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area. Most of our properties located in \nour San Francisco Bay Area market depend on PG&E for the delivery of these essential services. PG&E initiated voluntary \nreorganization proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in January 2019 in response to potential liabilities arising \nfrom a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in Northern California in 2017 and 2018. While PG&E emerged from bankruptcy in \nJuly 2020, there is no guarantee that PG&E, or other major utilities providers on which we rely in other cities in which we operate, will \nbe able to sustain safe operations and continue to provide consistent utilities services during similar or future incidents. During periods \nof high winds and high fire danger in past fire seasons, PG&E preemptively shut off power to areas of Central and Northern California. \nThe shutoffs were designed to help guard against fires ignited in areas with high winds and dry conditions. PG&E has warned that it \nmay have to employ shutoffs while the utility company addresses maintenance issues. Future shutoffs of power may impact the \nreliability of access to a stable power supply at our properties and, in turn, adversely impact our tenants’ businesses. In addition, there \nis no guarantee that PG&E’s safety measures mandated by regulators will be timely and sufficient to prevent future catastrophic \nwildfires. Similarly, we rely on a limited number of vendors that provide utilities services to our properties in other regions. There is no \nguarantee that similar events of bankruptcy or distress would not cause unanticipated disruptions in service to any of our properties in \naffected areas.\nThe realization of any of the above risks could significantly and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial expectations, \nour financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, the market price of our \ncommon stock, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nWe may change our business policies without stockholder approval.\nOur Board of Directors determines all of our material business policies, with management’s input, including those related to:\n•\nREIT qualification;\n•\nIncurrence of debt and debt management activities;\n•\nSelective acquisition, disposition, development, and redevelopment activities;\n•\nStockholder distributions; and\n•\nOther policies, as appropriate.\nOur Board of Directors may amend or revise these policies at any time without a vote of our stockholders. A change in these \npolicies could adversely affect our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nThere are limits on the ownership of our capital stock under which a stockholder may lose beneficial ownership of its \nshares and that may delay or prevent transactions that might otherwise be desired by our stockholders.\nIn order for a company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% of the value of its \noutstanding stock may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer individuals or entities (as set forth in the Internal Revenue \nCode) during the last half of a taxable year. Furthermore, shares of our company’s outstanding stock must be beneficially owned by 100 \nor more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. \nIn order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, among other things, our charter provides for an ownership limit, which \nprohibits, with certain exceptions, direct or constructive ownership of shares of stock representing more than 9.8% of the combined total \nvalue of our outstanding shares of stock by any person, as defined in our charter. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may \nwaive the ownership limit for any person. However, our Board of Directors may not grant such waiver if, after giving effect to such \nwaiver, we would be “closely held” under Section 856(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. As a condition to waiving the ownership limit, \nour Board of Directors may require a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of legal counsel in order to determine our status as a REIT. \nNotwithstanding the receipt of any such ruling or opinion, our Board of Directors may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems \nappropriate in connection with granting a waiver. \nOur charter further prohibits transferring shares of our stock if such transfer would result in our being “closely held” under \nSection 856(h) of the Internal Revenue Code or would result in shares of our stock being owned by fewer than 100 persons. \nThe constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of our common stock owned directly or constructively by \na group of related individuals or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. A transfer of shares to a person who, as a \nresult of the transfer, violates these limits shall be void or these shares shall be exchanged for shares of excess stock and transferred to \na trust for the benefit of one or more qualified charitable organizations designated by us. In that case, the intended transferee will have \nonly a right to share, to the extent of the transferee’s original purchase price for such shares, in proceeds from the trust’s sale of those \nshares and will effectively forfeit its beneficial ownership of the shares. These ownership limits could delay, defer, or prevent a \ntransaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the holders of our common stock or that might otherwise be \ndesired by such holders.\n25\nIn addition to the ownership limit, certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that \nmay be deemed to be desirable to our stockholders.\nAs authorized by Maryland law, our charter allows our Board of Directors to cause us to issue additional authorized but \nunissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of common or preferred stock \nwithout any stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock that could delay, defer, or prevent a \ntransaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that might, for other reasons, be desired by our common \nstockholders, or a series of preferred stock that has a dividend preference that may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our \ncommon stock.\nOur charter permits the removal of a director only upon a two-thirds majority of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the \nelection of directors, and our bylaws require advance notice of a stockholder’s intention to nominate directors or to present business for \nconsideration by stockholders at an annual meeting of our stockholders. However, the stockholders are able to adopt, alter, amend, or \nrepeal our bylaws with a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter and without the approval of the Board of Directors. Such \nchanges could potentially lead to disruption of corporate strategy, complications in strategic transactions, or other adverse effects. Our \ncharter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or change in control that involves a \npremium price for our common stock or that, for other reasons, may be desired by our stockholders.\nMarket and industry factors\nWe face substantial competition in our target markets.\n \nThe significant competition for business in our target markets could have an adverse effect on our operations. We compete for \ninvestment opportunities with:\n•\nOther REITs;\n•\nInsurance companies;\n•\nPension and investment funds;\n•\nPrivate equity entities;\n•\nPartnerships;\n•\nDevelopers;\n•\nInvestment companies; \n•\nOwners/occupants; and\n•\nForeign investors, including sovereign wealth funds.\nMany of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more than we can or \naccept more risk than we are willing to accept. These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a \ntenant or the geographic concentration of their investments. These entities may also have more favorable relationships and pricing with \nsuppliers and contractors and may complete construction projects sooner and at lower costs than we are able. We may also face \ncompetition with these entities for access to the same or similar raw materials and labor resources from suppliers and contractors, as \nwell as access to the specific suppliers and contractors we use. Competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment \nopportunities available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. If there is no matching growth in \ndemand, the intensified competition may lead to oversupply of available space comparable to ours and result in the pressure on rental \nrates and greater incentives awarded to tenants. To maintain our ability to retain current and attract new tenants, we may be forced to \nreduce the rental rates that our tenants are currently willing to pay or offer greater tenant concessions. Should we encounter intensified \ncompetition or oversupply, we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully, maintain our occupancy and rental rates, \nand continue to expand our business. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, our ability to pay \ndividends, and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nPoor economic conditions in our markets could adversely affect our business.\nOur properties are primarily located in the following markets:\n•\nGreater Boston\n•\nSan Francisco Bay Area\n•\nSan Diego\n•\nSeattle\n•\nMaryland\n•\nResearch Triangle\n•\nNew York City\n•\nTexas\n•\nCanada\n26\nAs a result of our geographic concentration, we depend upon the local economic and real estate conditions in these markets. \nWe are therefore subject to increased exposure (positive or negative) to economic, tax, and other competitive factors specific to \nmarkets in confined geographic areas. Our operations may also be affected if too many competing properties are built in any of these \nmarkets. An economic downturn in any of these markets could adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions to \nour stockholders. We cannot assure our stockholders that these markets will continue to grow or remain favorable to the life science \nindustry.\nImprovements to our properties are significantly more costly than improvements to traditional office space.\nMany of our properties generally contain infrastructure improvements that are significantly more costly than improvements to \nother property types. Although we have historically been able to recover the additional investment in infrastructure improvements \nthrough higher rental rates, there is the risk that we will not be able to continue to do so in the future. Typical infrastructure \nimprovements include:\n•\nReinforced concrete floors;\n•\nUpgraded roof loading capacity;\n•\nIncreased floor-to-ceiling heights;\n•\nHeavy-duty HVAC systems;\n•\nEnhanced environmental control technology;\n•\nSignificantly upgraded electrical, gas, and plumbing infrastructure; and\n•\nLaboratory benches and fume hoods.\nBecause many of our infrastructure improvements are specialized and costlier than those for other property types, we may be \nmore significantly impacted by any unanticipated delays or increased costs due to price volatility or supply shortages of construction \nmaterials or labor. As a result, we may be unable to complete our improvements as scheduled or within budgeted amounts, which may \nadversely affect our ability to lease available space to potential tenants or to reduce our projected project returns.\nOur tenants and venture investments are primarily in the life science industry, and changes within this industry may \nadversely impact our revenues from lease payments, the value of our non-real estate investments, and our operating results.\nIn general, our business strategy is to invest primarily in properties used by tenants in the life science industry. Through our \nventure investment portfolio, we also hold investments in companies that, similar to our tenant base, are concentrated in the life science \nindustry. Our business could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by an economic, financial, or banking crisis, or \nif these industries migrate from the U.S. to other countries. Because of our industry focus, events within this industry may have a more \npronounced effect on our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders than if we had more diversified \ntenants and investments. Also, some of our properties may be better suited for a particular life science industry tenant and could require \nsignificant modification before we are able to re-lease space to a tenant that does not operate in one of these industries. Generally, our \nproperties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office tenants without significant expenditures on renovations.\nOur ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon \nmarket conditions and the demand for laboratory space at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed.\nIt is common for businesses in the life science industry to undergo mergers, acquisitions, or other consolidations. Mergers, \nacquisitions, or consolidations of life science entities in the future could reduce the RSF requirements of our tenants and prospective \ntenants, which may adversely impact the demand for laboratory space, our future revenue from lease payments, and our results of \noperations.\nIt is also possible that our tenants or venture investments within these industries may be adversely affected by crises involving \nfinancial institutions with which they have business relationships. On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), the 16th largest bank \nin the U.S. at the time and headquartered in California, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, \nwhich appointed the FDIC as receiver. SVB was a provider of commercial and private banking products and services to industries \nincluding life science, technology, and healthcare. SVB is now a division of First Citizens Bank. Additionally, on March 12, 2023, the \nNew York State Department of Financial Services announced that it had closed New York-based Signature Bank and appointed the \nFDIC as a receiver, and on May 1, 2023, regulators seized control of First Republic Bank and sold the majority of its assets and \ndeposits to JPMorgan Chase. \nAlthough we did not have bank accounts, loans to or from, or investments in any venture funds led by SVB or any other \nrecently failed financial institution, some of our tenants and venture investments may have banking or other business relationships with \nsuch entities. Despite protections by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Treasury, if our tenants or venture investments are \nunable to access cash or other capital from these institutions or any other financial institution that might fail in the future, their liquidity, \nability to meet operating expense obligations, and financial performance may be adversely affected. Accordingly, such tenants may be \nunable to pay us rent, or our venture investments may decline in value, which may negatively impact our financial results.\n27\nSome of our current or future tenants may also include technology companies in their startup or growth phases of their life \ncycle. Fluctuations in market confidence in these companies or adverse changes in economic, financial, or banking conditions, such as \nthe failure of financial institutions, including the events discussed above, may have a disproportionate effect on the operations of such \ncompanies. Deterioration of our tenants’ financial condition may result in our inability to collect lease payments from them and therefore \nmay negatively impact our operating results. \nOur results of operations depend on our tenants’ research and development efforts and their ability to obtain funding \nfor these efforts.\nOur tenant base includes entities in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, life science, and related industries; \nacademic institutions; government institutions; and private foundations. Our tenants determine their research and development budgets \nbased on several factors, including the need to develop new products, the availability of government and other funding, competition, \nand the general availability of resources. Our investments through our venture investment portfolio are also in companies that, similar to \nour tenant base, are concentrated in the life science industry.\nResearch and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, research priorities, general economic \nconditions, institutional and government budgetary limitations, and mergers and consolidations of entities. Our business could be \nadversely impacted by a significant decrease in research and development expenditures by our tenants, our venture investment \nportfolio companies, or the life science industry. \n Our tenants also include research institutions whose funding is largely dependent on grants from government agencies, such \nas the NIH, the National Science Foundation, and similar agencies or organizations. U.S. government funding of research and \ndevelopment is subject to the political process, which is often unpredictable. Other programs, such as Homeland Security or defense, \ncould be viewed by the government as higher priorities. Additionally, proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have \nsometimes included reduced allocations to the NIH and other U.S. government agencies that fund research and development \nactivities. Additionally, the inability of the U.S. Congress to enact a budget for a fiscal year or the occurrence of partial or complete U.S. \nfederal government shutdowns may result in temporary closures of agencies such as the FDA or NIH, which could adversely affect \nbusiness operations of our tenants that are dependent on government approvals and appropriations. Any shift away from funding of \nresearch and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may adversely impact our tenants’ \noperations, which in turn may impact their demand for life science/laboratory space and their ability to make lease payments to us and \nthus adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies are subject to a number of risks unique \nto their industry, including (i) changes in technology, patent expiration, and intellectual property rights and protection, \n(ii) high levels of regulation, (iii) failures in the safety and efficacy of their products, and (iv) significant funding requirements \nfor product research and development. These risks may adversely affect our tenants’ ability to make rental payments or \nsatisfy their other lease obligations to us or may impact our venture investment portfolio companies’ value and consequently \nmay materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.\nChanges in technology, patent expiration, and intellectual property rights and protection\n•\nOur tenants and venture investment portfolio companies develop and sell products and services in an industry that is \ncharacterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and \nenhancements, evolving industry standards, and uncertainty over the implementation of new healthcare reform legislation, \nwhich may cause them to lose competitive positions and adversely affect their operations.\n•\nMany of our tenants and venture investment portfolio companies, and their licensors, require patent, copyright, or trade \nsecret protection and/or rights to use third-party intellectual property to develop, make, market, and sell their products and \ntechnologies. A tenant or venture investment portfolio company may be unable to commercialize its products or \ntechnologies if patents covering such products or technologies are not issued or are successfully challenged, narrowed, \ninvalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Additionally, a third party may own intellectual property that limits a tenant’s \nor venture investment portfolio company’s ability to bring to market its product or technology without securing a license or \nother rights to use the third-party intellectual property, which may require the tenant to pay an upfront fee or royalty. \nFailure to obtain these rights from third parties may make it challenging or impossible for a tenant or venture investment \nportfolio company to develop and commercialize its products or technologies, which could adversely affect its competitive \nposition and operations.\n•\nMany of our tenants and venture investment portfolio companies depend upon patents to provide exclusive marketing \nrights for their products. As their product patents expire, competitors may be able to legally produce and market products \nsimilar to the products of our tenants or venture investment portfolio companies, which could have a material adverse \neffect on their sales and results of operations.\n28\nHigh levels of regulation\n•\nSome of our life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies develop and manufacture products \nthat require regulatory approval, including approval from the FDA, prior to being manufactured, marketed, sold, and used. \nThe regulatory approval process to manufacture and market drugs is costly, typically takes many years, requires validation \nthrough clinical trials and the use of substantial resources, and is often unpredictable. A tenant or venture investment \nportfolio company may fail to obtain or may experience significant delays in obtaining these approvals. Even if the tenant \nor venture investment portfolio company obtains regulatory approvals, marketed products will be subject to ongoing \nregulatory review and potential loss of approvals.\n•\nThe ability of some of our life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies to commercialize any \nfuture products successfully will depend in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by government authorities, \nprivate health insurers, and other third-party payors. Additionally, reimbursements may decrease in the future.\nFailures in the safety and efficacy of their products\n•\nSome of our life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies may find that their potential products \nare not effective, or are even harmful, when tested in humans.\n•\nSome of our life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies depend upon the commercial \nsuccess of certain products. Even if a product developed by a life science industry tenant or venture investment portfolio \ncompany is proven safe and effective in human clinical trials, and the requisite regulatory approvals are obtained, \nsubsequent discovery of safety issues with these products could cause product liability events, additional regulatory \nscrutiny and requirements for additional labeling, loss of approval, withdrawal of products from the market, and the \nimposition of fines or criminal penalties.\n•\nA product developed, manufactured, marketed, or sold by a life science industry tenant or venture investment portfolio \ncompany may not be well accepted by doctors and patients, or may be less effective or accepted than a competitor’s \nproduct.\n•\nThe negative results of safety signals arising from the clinical trials of the competitors of our life science industry tenants \nor venture investment portfolio companies may prompt regulatory agencies to take actions that may adversely affect the \nclinical trials or products of our tenants or venture investment portfolio companies.\nSignificant funding requirements for product research and development\n•\nSome of our life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies require significant funding to \ndevelop and commercialize their products and technologies, which must be obtained from venture capital firms; private \ninvestors; public markets; other companies in the life science industry; or federal, state, and local governments. Such \nfunding may become unavailable or difficult to obtain. The ability of each tenant or venture investment portfolio company \nto raise capital will depend on its financial and operating condition, viability of its products and technology, and the overall \ncondition of the financial, banking, and economic environment, as well as government budget policies.\n•\nEven with sufficient funding, some of our life science industry tenants or venture investment portfolio companies may not \nbe able to discover or identify potential drug targets in humans, or potential drugs for use in humans, or to create tools or \ntechnologies that are commercially useful in the discovery or identification of potential drug targets or drugs.\n•\nSome of our life science industry tenants or venture investment portfolio companies may not be able to successfully \nmanufacture their products economically, even if such products are proven through human clinical trials to be safe and \neffective in humans.\n•\nMarketed products also face commercialization risk, and some of our life science industry tenants and venture investment \nportfolio companies may never realize projected levels of product utilization or revenues.\n•\nNegative news regarding the products, the clinical trials, or other business developments of our life science industry \ntenants or venture investment portfolio companies may cause their stock price or credit profile to deteriorate.\nWe cannot assure our stockholders that our life science industry tenants or venture investment portfolio companies will be able \nto develop, manufacture, market, or sell their products and technologies due to the risks inherent in the life science industry. Any life \nscience industry tenant or venture investment portfolio company that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described \nabove may have difficulty making rental payments or satisfying its other lease obligations to us or may have difficulty maintaining the \nvalue of our investment. Such risks may also decrease the credit quality of our life science industry tenants and venture investment \nportfolio companies or cause us to expend more funds and resources on the space leased by these tenants than we originally \nanticipated. The increased burden on our resources due to adverse developments relating to our life science industry tenants may \ncause us to achieve lower-than-expected yields on the space leased by these tenants. Negative news relating to our more significant \nlife science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies may also adversely impact our stock price.\n29\nOur agtech industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies are subject to a number of risks unique to \ntheir industry, including (i) uncertain regulatory environment, (ii) seasonality in business, (iii) unavailability of transportation \nmechanisms for carrying products and raw materials, (iv) changes in costs or constraints on supplies or energy used in \noperations, (v) strikes or labor slowdowns or labor contract negotiations, and (vi) rapid technological changes in agriculture. \nThese risks may adversely affect our tenants’ ability to make rental payments or satisfy their other lease obligations to us or \nmay impact our venture investment portfolio companies’ value, which consequently may materially adversely affect our \nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.\nUncertain regulatory environment\n•\nLaws and regulations governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services and products developed \nby the agtech industry continue to evolve. Existing and future laws and regulations and the halting of operations at certain \nagencies resulting from partial or complete U.S. federal government shutdowns may impede the growth of our agtech \nindustry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies. These laws and regulations may cover, among other areas, \ntaxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, business licensing, \nand consumer protection.\nSeasonality in business\n•\nOur agtech industry tenants’ and venture investment portfolio companies’ businesses may fluctuate from time to time due \nto seasonal weather conditions and other factors out of their control, affecting products and services our agtech industry \ntenants and venture investment portfolio companies offer.\nUnavailability of transportation mechanisms for carrying products and raw materials\n•\nSome of our agtech industry tenants’ and venture investment portfolio companies’ businesses depend on transportation \nservices to deliver their products or to deliver raw materials to their clients. If transportation service providers are \nunavailable or fail to deliver our agtech industry tenants’ or venture investment portfolio companies’ products in a timely \nmanner, they may be unable to manufacture and deliver their services and products on a timely basis.\nChanges in costs or constraints on supplies or energy used in operations\n•\nSimilarly, if fuel or other energy prices increase, it may increase transportation costs, which could affect our agtech \nindustry tenants’ and venture investment portfolio companies’ businesses.\nStrikes or labor slowdowns or labor contract negotiations\n•\nOur agtech industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies may face labor strikes, work slowdowns, labor \ncontract negotiations, or other job actions from their employees or third-party contractors. In the event of a strike, work \nslowdown, or other similar labor unrest, our agtech industry tenants or venture investment portfolio companies may not \nhave the ability to adequately staff their businesses, which could have an adverse effect on their operations and revenue.\nRapid technological changes in agriculture\n•\nThe agtech industry is characterized by regular new product and service introductions, and the emergence of new industry \nstandards and practices. A failure to respond in a timely manner to these market conditions could materially impair the \noperations of our agtech industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies.\n•\nTechnological advances in agriculture could decrease the demand for crop nutrients, energy, and other crop input \nproducts and services our agtech industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies provide. Genetically \nengineered crops that resist disease and insects could affect the demand for certain of our tenants’ or venture investment \nportfolio companies’ products. Demand for fuel could decline as technology allows for more efficient usage of equipment.\nWe cannot assure our stockholders that our agtech industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies will be able to \ndevelop, produce, market, or sell their products and services due to the risks inherent in the agtech industry. Any agtech industry tenant \nor venture investment portfolio company that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described above may have difficulty \nmaking rental payments or satisfying its other lease obligations to us. Such risks may also decrease the credit quality of our agtech \nindustry tenants or venture investment portfolio companies or cause us to expend more funds and resources on the space leased by \nthese tenants than we originally anticipated. The increased burden on our resources due to adverse developments relating to our \nagtech industry tenants may cause us to achieve lower-than-expected yields on the space leased by these tenants. Unfavorable news \nrelating to our more significant agtech industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies may also adversely impact our stock \nprice.\n30\nOur technology industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies are subject to a number of risks unique \nto their industry, including (i) an uncertain regulatory environment, (ii) rapid technological changes, (iii) a dependency on the \nmaintenance and security of the Internet infrastructure, (iv) significant funding requirements for product research and \ndevelopment and sales growth, and (v) inadequate intellectual property protections. These risks may adversely affect our \ntenants’ ability to make rental payments to us or satisfy their other lease obligations or may impact our venture investment \nportfolio companies’ value, which consequently may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial \ncondition, and stock price.\nUncertain regulatory environment\n•\nLaws and regulations governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services continue to evolve. \nExisting and future laws and regulations and the halting of operations at certain agencies resulting from partial or \ncomplete U.S. federal government shutdowns may impede the growth of our technology industry tenants and venture \ninvestment portfolio companies. These laws and regulations may cover, among other areas, taxation, worker \nclassification, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, business \nlicensing, and consumer protection.\nRapid technological changes\n•\nThe technology industry is characterized by rapid changes in customer requirements and preferences, frequent new \nproduct and service introductions, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices. A failure to respond in a \ntimely manner to these market conditions could materially impair the operations of our technology industry tenants and \nventure investment portfolio companies.\nDependency on the maintenance and security of the Internet infrastructure\n•\nSome of our technology industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies depend on continued and \nunimpeded access to the Internet by users of their products and services, as well as access to mobile networks. Internet \nservice providers and mobile network operators may be able to block, degrade, or charge additional fees to these tenants, \nventure investment portfolio companies, or users of their products and services.\n•\nThe Internet has experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, outages and other delays. These outages and \ndelays, as well as problems caused by cyberattacks and computer malware, viruses, worms, and similar programs, may \nmaterially affect the ability of our technology industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies to conduct \nbusiness.\n•\nReliance on a limited number of cloud provider vendors may result in detrimental impacts on or halts of operations during \ninstances of network outages or interruptions.\n•\nSecurity breaches or network attacks may delay or interrupt the services provided by our technology industry tenants and \nventure investment portfolio companies and could harm their reputations or subject them to significant liability.\nSignificant funding requirements for product research and development and sales growth\n•\nSome of our technology industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies require significant funding to \ndevelop and commercialize their products and technologies, which must be obtained from venture capital firms; private \ninvestors; public markets; companies in the technology industry; or federal, state, and local governments. Such funding \nmay become unavailable or difficult to obtain. The ability of each tenant or venture investment portfolio company to raise \ncapital will depend on its financial and operating condition, viability of their products, and the overall condition of the \nfinancial, banking, governmental budget policies, and economic environment.\n•\nEven with sufficient funding, some of our technology industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies may not \nbe able to discover or identify potential customers or to create tools or technologies that are commercially useful.\n•\nSome of our technology industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies may not be able to successfully \nmanufacture their products economically.\n•\nMarketed products also face commercialization risk, and some of our technology industry tenants and venture investment \nportfolio companies may never realize projected levels of product utilization or revenues.\n•\nUnfavorable news regarding the products or other business developments of our technology industry tenants or venture \ninvestment portfolio companies may cause their stock price or credit profile to deteriorate.\nInadequate intellectual property protections\n•\nThe products and services provided by some of our technology industry tenants and venture investment portfolio \ncompanies are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying, and inadequate intellectual property laws and \nother inadequate protections could prevent them from enforcing or defending their proprietary technologies. These tenants \nand venture investment portfolio companies may also face legal risks arising out of user-generated content. \n•\nTrademark, copyright, patent, domain name, trade dress, and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and \nmay require our technology industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies to incur significant costs to \nprotect their intellectual property rights. \n31\nWe cannot assure our stockholders that our technology industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies will be \nable to develop, manufacture, market, or sell their products and services due to the risks inherent in the technology industry. Any \ntechnology industry tenant or venture investment portfolio company that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described \nabove may have difficulty making rental payments or satisfying its other lease obligations to us or may have difficulty maintaining the \nvalue of our investment. Such risks may also decrease the credit quality of our technology industry tenants or venture investment \nportfolio companies or cause us to expend more funds and resources on the space leased by these tenants than we originally \nanticipated. The increased burden on our resources due to adverse developments relating to our technology industry tenants may \ncause us to achieve lower-than-expected yields on the space leased by these tenants. Unfavorable news relating to our more \nsignificant technology industry tenants and venture investment portfolio companies may also adversely impact our stock price.\nThe companies in which we invest through our non-real estate venture investment portfolio expose us to risks similar \nto those of our tenant base and additional risks inherent in venture capital investing, which could materially affect our \nreported asset and liability values and earnings and may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations.\nThrough our strategic venture investment portfolio, we hold investments in companies that, similar to our tenant base, are \nconcentrated in the life science industry. The venture investment portfolio companies in which we invest are accordingly subject to risks \nsimilar to those posed by our tenant base, including those disclosed in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition, the companies in \nwhich we invest through our venture investment portfolio are subject to the risks inherent in venture capital investing and may be \nadversely affected by external factors beyond our control and other risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n•\nRisks inherent in venture capital investing, which typically focuses on small early-stage companies with unproven \ntechnologies and limited access to capital and is therefore generally considered more speculative than investment in \nlarger, more established companies.\n•\nMarket disruption and volatility, which may adversely affect the value of the companies in which we hold equity \ninvestments and, in turn, our ability to realize gains upon sales of these investments.\n•\nDisruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the capital markets and global economy, which may impact the ability of the \ncompanies in which we invest to raise additional capital or access capital from venture capital investors or financial \ninstitutions on favorable terms.\n•\nLiquidity of the companies in which we invest, which may (i) impede our ability to realize the value at which these \ninvestments are carried if we are required to dispose of them, (ii) make it difficult for us to sell these investments on a \ntimely basis, and (iii) impair the value of such investments.\n•\nChanges in the political climate, potential reforms and changes to government negotiation and regulation, the effect of \nhealthcare reform legislation, including those that may limit pricing of pharmaceutical products and drugs, market prices \nand conditions, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, the manufacturing and \ndistribution of new products, product safety and efficacy issues, and new collaborative agreements, all of which may affect \nthe valuation, funding opportunities, business operations, and financial results of the companies in which we invest.\n•\nChanges in U.S. federal government organizations or other agencies, including changes in policy, regulations, budgeting, \nretention of key leadership and other personnel, administration of drug approvals or restrictions on drug product or service \ndevelopment or commercialization, or a partial or complete future government shutdown resulting in temporary closures of \nagencies such as the FDA and SEC, could adversely affect the companies in which we invest, including delays in the \ncommercialization of such companies’ products, decreased funding of research and development in the life science \nindustry, or delays surrounding approval of budget proposals for any in this industry.\n•\nImpacts or changes in business for any reason, including diversion of healthcare resources away from clinical trials, \ndelays, or difficulties enrolling patients or maintaining scheduled appointments in clinical trials, interruptions, and delays in \nlaboratory research due to the reduction in employee resources stemming from social distancing requirements and the \ndesire of employees to avoid contact with people, insufficient inventory of supplies and reagents necessary for laboratory \nresearch due to interruptions in supply chain, delays or difficulties obtaining clinical site locations or engaging clinical site \nstaff, interruptions on clinical site monitoring due to travel restrictions, delays in interacting with or receiving approval from \nregulatory agencies in connection with research activities or clinical trials, and disruptions to manufacturing facilities and \nsupply lines.\n•\nReduction in revenue or revenue growth, deterioration in the global economy, or other reasons, may impair the value of \nthe companies in which we hold equity investments or impede their ability to raise additional capital.\n•\nSeasonal weather conditions, changes in availability of transportation or labor, and other related factors may affect the \nproducts and services or the availability of the products and services of the companies in which we invest in the agtech \nsector.\nMany of the factors listed above are beyond our control and, if the venture investment portfolio companies are adversely \naffected by any of the foregoing, could materially affect our reported asset and liability values and earnings and may materially and \nadversely affect our reported results of operations. The occurrence of any of these adverse events could cause the market price of \nshares of our common stock to decline regardless of the performance of our primary real estate business.\n32\nMarket and other external factors may adversely impact the valuation of our non-real estate equity investments.\nWe hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies, limited partnerships, and privately held entities primarily \ninvolved \nin the life science industry \nthrough our venture investment portfolio. The valuation of these investments is affected by many \nexternal factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, market prices, market conditions, the effect of healthcare reform \nlegislation, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, the manufacturing and distribution of new \nproducts, product safety and efficacy issues, and new collaborative agreements. In addition, partial or complete future government \nshutdowns that may result in temporary closures of agencies such as the FDA and SEC may adversely affect the processing of initial \npublic offerings, business operations, financial results, and funding for projects of the companies in which we hold equity investments. \nUnfavorable developments with respect to any of these factors may have an adverse impact on the valuation of our equity investments.\nMarket and other external factors may negatively impact the liquidity of our non-real estate equity investments.\nWe make and hold investments in privately held life science companies through our venture investment portfolio. These \ninvestments may be illiquid, which could impede our ability to realize the value at which these investments are carried if we are required \nto dispose of them. The lack of liquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments on a timely basis and \nmay impair the value of these investments. If we are required to liquidate all or a portion of these investments quickly, we may realize \nsignificantly less than the amounts at which we had previously valued these investments.\nGovernment factors\nNegative impact on economic growth resulting from the combination of federal income tax policy, debt policy, and \ngovernment spending may adversely affect our results of operations.\nGlobal macroeconomic conditions affect our and our tenants’ businesses. Instability in the banking and government sectors of \nthe U.S. and/or the negative impact on economic growth resulting from the combination of government tax policy, debt policy, and \ngovernment spending, may have an adverse effect on the overall economic growth and our future revenue growth and profitability. \nVolatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions could undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets \nand cause our tenants to reduce or defer their spending, which would negatively affect our business. Growth in the markets we serve \ncould be at a slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time. Differing economic conditions and \npatterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographic regions in which we operate and the industries we serve may in the \nfuture affect demand for our services. Our revenues and profitability are derived from our tenants in North America, some of which \nderive significant revenues from their international operations. Ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty affects our business in a \nnumber of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand beyond the short term and to effectively \nbuild our revenue and spending plans. Economic volatility and uncertainty are particularly challenging because it may take some time \nfor the effects and resulting changes in demand patterns to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Changing \ndemand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. These \nrisks may impact our overall liquidity, our borrowing costs, or the market price of our common stock.\nChanges to the U.S. tax laws and implementation of new tax policies could have a significant negative impact on the \noverall economy, our tenants, and our business. \nChanges to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, including changes that may be introduced from time to time as a \nresult of a change in administration of the U.S. government, could negatively impact the overall economy, government revenues, the \nreal estate industry, our tenants, and us, in ways that cannot be reliably predicted. There can be no assurance that future changes to \nthe U.S. tax laws or regulatory changes will not be proposed or enacted that could impact our business and financial results. The REIT \nrules are regularly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, which \nmay result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes. If enacted, certain of such changes could have \nan adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nFurthermore, the incoming administration of President Trump has included as part of its agenda a potential reform of U.S. tax \nlaws. The details of the potential reform have not yet emerged, but during his 2024 presidential campaign, President Trump outlined \nseveral intended reforms, including reducing the corporate tax rate for domestic oil and gas production, repealing green energy tax \ncredits, extending certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”), and imposing new tariffs. Many political and \neconomic commentators believe that the combined impact of extending certain tax benefits pursuant to the TCJA and the \nimplementation of new tariffs could potentially lead to increases in the U.S. deficit, inflation, and interest rates, all of which could \ncontribute to increases in market interest rates and a decrease in U.S. economic growth with a possibility of a recession. However, we \ncannot predict whether, when, or to what extent these new regulations or rulings will be issued, nor the long-term impact of the \nproposed tax reforms on the real estate industry. Current and prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect \nof potential changes to the U.S. federal tax laws on an investment in our shares. \n33\nActual and anticipated changes to the regulations of the healthcare system may have a negative impact on the \npricing of drugs, the cost of healthcare coverage, and the reimbursement of healthcare services and products. \nThe FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions directly regulate many critical activities of life science, technology, and \nhealthcare industries, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, \nproduct distribution, adverse event reporting, and product risk management. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of products \ndepend in part on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third-party payors, including governments and private health plans. \nGovernments may regulate coverage, reimbursement, and pricing of products to control cost or affect utilization of products. Private \nhealth plans may also seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. Substantial \nuncertainty exists regarding the reimbursement by third-party payors of newly approved healthcare products. The U.S. and foreign \ngovernments regularly consider reform measures that affect healthcare coverage and costs. Such reforms may include changes to the \ncoverage and reimbursement of healthcare services and products. In particular, there have been judicial and congressional challenges \nto the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act \n(collectively, the “ACA”), which could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare terms and services covered by \nplans authorized by the ACA. During 2017 several attempts were made to amend the ACA; however, no amendment proposal gained \nthe 50-vote support from the U.S. Senate needed to pass a repeal bill. As a result, in October 2017, then President Trump issued \nan executive order, “Promoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States,” which the Biden administration repealed \nin January 2021. Since winning reelection in November 2024, President Trump has stated that he has “concepts of a plan” to repeal or \nreform the ACA, but further details have not yet been publicly disclosed. It is unclear how these healthcare reform measures of the \nTrump administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal, or replace the ACA will impact our business. It is also unknown what \nother changes will be implemented through the U.S. Congress or future executive orders and how these would impact our tenants. \nGovernment and other regulatory oversight and future regulatory and government interference with the healthcare systems may \nadversely impact our tenants’ businesses and our business.\nU.S. government tenants may not receive anticipated appropriations, which could hinder their ability to pay us.\nU.S. government tenants are subject to government funding. If one or more of our U.S. government tenants fail to receive \nanticipated appropriations, we may not be able to collect rental amounts due to us. A significant reduction in federal government \nspending, particularly a sudden decrease due to tax reform or a sequestration process, which has occurred in recent years and may \noccur again in the coming years, could also adversely affect the ability of these tenants to fulfill lease obligations or decrease the \nlikelihood that they will renew their leases with us. In addition, budgetary pressures have resulted in, and may continue to result in, \nreduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities, such as the NIH. For example, the NIH \nbudget has been, and may continue to be, significantly impacted by the sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011, \nwhich became effective on March 1, 2013. Past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced NIH and other research and \ndevelopment budgets. Any shift away from the funding of research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government \nbudget proposals may cause our tenants to default on rental payments or delay or forgo leasing our rental space, which could adversely \naffect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, the inability of the U.S. Congress to enact a budget for a \nfuture fiscal year or the occurrence of partial or complete U.S. federal government shutdowns could adversely impact demand for our \nservices by limiting federal funding available to our tenants and their customers. In addition, defaults under leases with U.S. government \ntenants are governed by federal statute and not by state eviction or rent deficiency laws. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, leases with U.S. \ngovernment tenants at our properties accounted for approximately\n \n1.4%\n of our aggregate annual rental revenue in effect as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n.\nSome of our tenants may be subject to increasing government price controls and other healthcare cost-containment \nmeasures.\nGovernment healthcare cost-containment measures can significantly affect our tenants’ revenue and profitability. In many \ncountries outside the U.S., government agencies strictly control, directly or indirectly, the prices at which our pharmaceutical industry \ntenants’ products are sold. In a number of European Union (“EU”) member states, the pricing and/or reimbursement of prescription \npharmaceuticals are subject to governmental control, and legislators, policymakers, and healthcare insurance funds continue to \npropose and implement cost-containing measures to keep healthcare costs down, due in part to the attention being paid to healthcare \ncost containment and other austerity measures in the EU. In the U.S., our pharmaceutical industry tenants are subject to substantial \npricing pressures from state Medicaid programs, private insurance programs, and pharmacy benefit managers. In addition, many state \nlegislative proposals could further negatively affect pricing and/or reimbursement for our pharmaceutical industry tenants’ products. \nAlso, the pricing environment for pharmaceuticals continues to be in the political spotlight in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and medical \ndevice product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and calls for reform. Some states have implemented, and \nother states are considering implementing, pharmaceutical price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, \nand some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations who are not Medicaid \neligible. We anticipate that pricing pressures from both governments and private payors inside and outside the U.S. will become more \nsevere over time.\n34\nChanges in U.S. federal government funding for the FDA, the NIH, and other government agencies could hinder their \nability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, properly administer drug innovation, or prevent new products \nand services from being developed or commercialized by our life science industry tenants and venture investment portfolio \ncompanies, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and \nfunding levels, the ability to hire and retain key personnel, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the \nagency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the NIH and other government agencies that fund \nresearch and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nThe ability of the FDA, the NIH, and other government agencies to properly administer their functions is highly dependent on \nthe levels of government funding and the ability to fill key leadership appointments, among various factors. Delays in filling or replacing \nkey positions could significantly impact the ability of the FDA, the NIH, and other agencies to fulfill their functions and could greatly \nimpact healthcare and the drug industry.\nHowever, any future government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits may include reduced allocations to the \nFDA, the NIH, and other related government agencies. These budgetary pressures may result in a reduced ability by the FDA and the \nNIH to perform their respective roles and may have a related impact on academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding \nis fully or partially dependent on both the level and the timing of funding from government sources. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has \nbeen nominated by President Trump for Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA and \nNIH, has previously stated his intent to downsize or restructure these agencies, including by appointing new directors to the agencies. \nHowever, no definitive proposals have been publicly disclosed at this time, and we cannot anticipate the effect that any such \nrestructuring or new appointments may have on our tenants or our business.\nIn the event of a partial or complete government shutdown, the FDA and certain other science agencies may temporarily cease \ncertain operations. Furthermore, during such shutdown, the FDA may maintain only operations deemed to be essential for public health \nwhile suspending the acceptance of new medical product applications and routine regulatory and compliance work related to medical \nproducts, certain drugs, and foods.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies, such as those resulting from a restructuring of these agencies, a government \nshutdown, or uncertainty from stopgap spending bills may slow the time necessary for new drugs and devices to be reviewed and/or \napproved by necessary government agencies and may affect the ability of the healthcare and drug industries to deliver new products to \nthe market in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our tenants’ operating results and business. Interruptions to the function of \nthe FDA and other government agencies could adversely affect the demand for laboratory space and significantly impact our operating \nresults and our business.\nChanges in laws and regulations that control drug pricing for government programs may adversely impact our \noperating results and our business.\nOn August 22, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law. This legislation allows, for the first time ever, the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate Medicare drug prices directly with manufacturers. Specifically, the law \nrequires manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for select drugs covered by Medicare Part B and Part D or be \nsubject to an excise tax for noncompliance, introduces penalties for drug manufacturers that increase drug prices over the rate of \ninflation, and caps additional out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare beneficiaries.\nWe cannot predict the ultimate impact of this legislation or the content and outcome of future potential reforms and changes \nto the government’s ability to regulate and negotiate drug pricing. Changes in policy that limit prices may reduce the financial \nincentives for the research and development efforts that lead to discovery and production of new therapies and solutions to life-\nthreatening conditions. Negative impacts of new policies could adversely affect our tenants’ and venture investment portfolio \ncompanies’ businesses, including life science companies, which may reduce the demand for life science/laboratory space and \nnegatively impact our operating results and our business.\n35\nGlobal factors\nThe outbreak of any highly infectious or contagious disease could adversely impact or cause disruption to our \nfinancial condition and results of operations. \nThe effects of any future outbreak of any highly infectious or contagious disease on our (or our tenants’) ability to successfully \noperate could be adversely impacted by the following factors, among others:\n•\nThe continued service and availability of personnel, including our executive officers and other leaders who are part of our \nmanagement team, and our ability to recruit, attract, and retain skilled personnel. To the extent our management or \npersonnel are impacted in significant numbers by the outbreak of pandemic or epidemic disease and are not available or \nallowed to conduct work, our business and operating results may be negatively impacted.\n•\nOur (or our tenants’) ability to operate, generally or in affected areas, or delays in the supply of products or services from \nour vendors that are necessary for us to operate effectively.\n•\nOur tenants’ ability to pay rent on their leases in full and timely and, to the extent necessary, our inability to restructure our \ntenants’ long-term rent obligations on terms favorable to us or to timely recapture the space for re-leasing.\n•\nDifficulty in our accessing debt and/or equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in \nthe global financial markets, or deterioration in credit and financing conditions, which may affect our (or our tenants’) \nability to access capital necessary to fund business operations or replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis \nand may adversely affect the valuation of financial assets and liabilities, any of which could affect our (or our tenants’) \nability to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements or could have a material adverse effect on our business, \nfinancial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n•\nComplete or partial closures of, or other operational issues at, one or more of our properties resulting from government \naction or directives.\n•\nOur (or our tenants’) ability to continue or complete construction as planned for our tenants’ operations, or delays in the \nsupply of materials or labor necessary for construction, which may affect our (or our tenants’) ability to complete \nconstruction or to complete it timely, our ability to prevent a lease termination, and our ability to collect rent, which may \nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n•\nThe cost of implementing precautionary measures, including, but not limited to, potential additional health insurance and \nlabor-related costs.\n•\nGovernmental efforts (such as moratoriums on or suspensions of eviction proceedings) that may affect our ability to collect \nrent or enforce remedies for the failure of our tenants to pay rent.\n•\nUncertainty related to whether the U.S. Congress or state legislatures will pass additional laws providing for additional \neconomic stimulus packages, governmental funding, or other relief programs, whether such measures will be enacted, \nwhether our tenants will be eligible or will apply for any such funds, whether the funds, if available, could be used by our \ntenants to pay rent, and whether such funds will be sufficient to supplement our tenants’ rent and other obligations to us.\n•\nDeterioration of global economic conditions and job losses, which may decrease demand for and occupancy levels of our \nrental properties and may cause our rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted.\n•\nOur dependence on short-term and long-term debt sources, including our unsecured senior line of credit, commercial \npaper program, and unsecured senior notes, which may affect our ability to continue our investing activities and make \ndistributions to our stockholders.\n•\nDeclines in the valuation of our properties, which may affect our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain \ndebt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of debt funding.\n•\nDeclines in the valuation of our venture investment portfolio, which may (i) impede our ability to realize the value at which \nthese investments are carried if we are required to dispose of them, (ii) make it difficult for us to sell these investments on \na timely basis, and (iii) impair the value of such investments.\n•\nRefusal, failure, or delay by one or more of our lenders under our unsecured senior line of credit to fund their financing \ncommitment to us, which we may not be able to replace on favorable terms, or at all.\n•\nTo the extent we enter into derivative financial instruments, one or more counterparties to our derivative financial \ninstruments could default on their obligations to us or could fail, increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of \nutilizing these instruments.\n•\nAny possession taken of our properties, in whole or in part, by governmental authorities for public purposes in eminent \ndomain proceedings.\n•\nOur level of insurance coverage and recovery we receive under any insurance we maintain, which may be delayed by, or \ninsufficient to fully offset potential/actual losses caused by any highly infectious or contagious disease.\n•\nAny increase in insurance premiums and imposition of large deductibles.\n•\nOur level of dependence on the Internet, as it relates to employees’ working remotely, and increases in malware \ncampaigns and phishing attacks preying on the uncertainties surrounding any highly infectious or contagious disease, \nwhich may increase our vulnerability to cyberattacks.\n•\nOur ability to ensure business continuity in the event our continuity of operations plan is not effective or is improperly \nimplemented or deployed during a disruption.\n•\nOur ability to operate, which may cause our business and operating results to decline or may impact our ability to comply \nwith regulatory obligations and may lead to reputational harm and regulatory issues or fines.\n36\nThe rapid spread, development, and fluidity of a highly infectious or contagious disease may result in significant disruption of \nthe global financial market and labor markets and may lead to a deterioration of economic conditions, an economic downturn, and/or a \nrecession at a global scale, which could materially affect our (or our tenants’) performance, financial condition, results of operations, \nand cash flows.\nThe outbreak or spread of any highly infectious or contagious disease could adversely impact or cause disruption to \nour tenants’ financial condition and results of operations, which may adversely impact our ability to generate income \nsufficient to meet operating expenses or generate income and capital appreciation\n.\n \nOur tenants, many of which conduct business in the life science industry, may incur significant costs or losses responding to \nany highly infectious or contagious disease, lose business due to interruption in their operations, or incur other liabilities related to \nshelter-in-place orders, quarantines, infection, or other related factors. Tenants that experience deteriorating financial conditions as a \nresult of the outbreak or spread of such disease may be unwilling or unable to pay rent in full or timely due to bankruptcy, lack of \nliquidity, lack of funding, operational failures, or other reasons. Our tenants’ defaults and delayed or partial rental payments could \nadversely impact our rental revenues and operating results. \nThe negative effects of any highly infectious or contagious disease on our tenants in the life science industry may include, but \nare not limited to:\n•\nDelays or difficulties in enrolling patients or maintaining scheduled study visits in clinical trials;\n•\nDelays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and staff;\n•\nDiversion of healthcare resources away from clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our tenants’ \nclinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our tenants’ clinical trials;\n•\nInterruptions of key clinical trial or other research activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel \nimposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers, and others;\n•\nLimitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on our tenants’ research, business, or clinical trials, \nincluding because of sickness of employees or their families, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of \npeople, or as a result of the governmental imposition of shelter-in-place or similar working restrictions;\n•\nInterruptions in supply chain, manufacturing, and global shipping, or other delays that may affect the transport of materials \nnecessary for our tenants’ research, clinical trials, or manufacturing activities;\n•\nReduction in revenue projections for our tenants’ products due to the prioritization of the treatment of affected patients \nover other treatments, such as specialty and elective procedures;\n•\nDelays in necessary interactions with ethics committees, regulators, and other important agencies and contractors due to \nlimitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees; \n•\nDelays in receiving approval from regulatory authorities to initiate planned clinical trials or research activities;\n•\nDelays in commercialization of our tenants’ products and approval by government authorities (such as the FDA and the \nfederal and state Emergency Management Agencies) of our tenants’ products caused by disruptions, funding shortages, \nor health concerns, as well as by the prioritization by the FDA of the review and approvals of diagnostics, therapeutics, \nand vaccines that are related to an outbreak;\n•\nDifficulty in retaining staff or rehiring staff in connection with layoffs caused by deteriorating global market conditions; \n•\nChanges in local regulations as part of a response to an outbreak or spread that may require our tenants to change the \nways in which their clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs or the discontinuation of the clinical \ntrials altogether;\n•\nRefusal or reluctance of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies outside the U.S.; \n•\nDiminishing public trust in healthcare facilities or other facilities that are treating (or have treated) patients affected by \ncontagious diseases; and \n•\nInability to access capital on terms favorable to our tenants because of changes in company valuation and/or investor \nappetite due to a general downturn in economic and financial conditions and the volatility of the market.\nThe negative effects of any highly infectious or contagious disease on our tenants in the agtech industry may include:\n•\nReduction in productive capacity and profitability because of decreased labor availability due, for example, to government \nrestrictions, the inability of employees to report to work, or collective bargaining efforts; \n•\nPotential contract cancellations, project reductions, and reduction in demand for our tenants’ products due to the adverse \neffect on business confidence and consumer sentiments and the general downturn in economic conditions;\n•\nDisruption of the logistics necessary to import, export, and deliver products to target companies and their customers due \nto ports and other channels of entry being closed or operating at only a portion of capacity;\n•\nDisruptions to manufacturing facilities and supply lines; and \n•\nInability to access capital on terms favorable to our tenants because of changes in company valuation and/or investor \nappetite due to a general downturn in economic and financial conditions and the volatility of the market.\n37\nThe negative effects of any highly infectious or contagious disease on our tenants in the technology industry may include:\n•\nReduction in staff productivity due to business closures, alternative working arrangements, or illness of staff and/or illness \nin the family;\n•\nReduction in sales of our tenants’ services and products, longer sales cycles, reduction in subscription duration and value, \nslower adoption of new technologies, and increase in price competition due to economic uncertainties and downturns;\n•\nDisruptions to our tenants’ supply chain, manufacturing vendors, or logistics providers of products or services;\n•\nLimitations on business and marketing activities due to travel restrictions, virtualization, or cancellation of related events; \n•\nAdverse impact on customer relationships and our ability to recognize revenues due to our tenants’ inability to access their \nclients’ sites for implementation and on-site consulting services;\n•\nInability to recruit and develop highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications, to conduct background checks on \npotential employees, and to provide necessary equipment and training to new and existing employees; \n•\nNetwork infrastructure and technology system failures of our tenants, or of third-party services used by our tenants, which \nmay result in system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in product development, lengthy \ninterruptions in services, breaches of data security, and loss of critical data;\n•\nHigher employment compensation costs that may not be offset by improved productivity or increased sales; and \n•\nInability to access capital on terms favorable to our tenants because of changes in company valuation and/or investor \nappetite due to a general downturn in of economic and financial conditions and the volatility of the market.\nThe potential impact of any highly infectious or contagious disease with respect to our tenants or our properties is difficult to \npredict and could have a material adverse impact on our tenants’ operations and, in turn, on our revenues, business, and results of \noperations, as well as the value of our stock. Any highly infectious or contagious disease may directly or indirectly cause the realization \nof any of the other risk factors included in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOther factors\nWe may incur significant costs if we fail to comply with laws or if laws change.\nOur properties are subject to many federal, state, and local regulatory requirements and to state and local fire, life-safety, \nenvironmental, and other requirements. If we do not comply with all of these requirements, we may have to pay fines to government \nauthorities or damage awards to private litigants or temporarily halt operations due to injunctions. We do not know whether these \nrequirements will change or whether new requirements will be imposed. Changes in these regulatory requirements could require us to \nmake significant unanticipated expenditures. These expenditures could have an adverse effect on us and our ability to make \ndistributions to our stockholders.\nFor example, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, also referred to as Proposition 65, requires “clear \nand reasonable” warnings be given to persons who are exposed to chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer or \nreproductive toxicity. We believe that we comply with Proposition 65 requirements; however, there can be no assurance that we will not \nbe adversely affected by litigation or regulatory enforcement relating to Proposition 65. In addition, there can be no assurance that the \ncosts of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations will not be significant or will not adversely affect our ability to meet our \nfinancial expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may incur significant costs in complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws.\nUnder the ADA, places of public accommodation and/or commercial facilities must meet federal requirements related to access \nand use by disabled persons. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures at our properties to comply with this law. In \naddition, non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.\nA number of additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations exist regarding access to properties by disabled persons. \nThese regulations may require modifications to our properties or may affect future renovations. These expenditures may have an \nadverse impact on overall returns on our investments.\n38\nWe face possible risks and costs associated with the effects of climate change and severe weather\n.\nWe cannot predict the rate at which climate change will progress. However, the physical effects of climate change could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our properties, operations, and business. For example, most of our properties are located along the east and \nwest coasts of the U.S. To the extent that climate change impacts changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience severe \nweather, including hurricanes, severe winter storms, and coastal flooding due to increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. \nCertain of our properties are also located along shorelines and may be vulnerable to coastal hazards, such as sea level rise, severe \nweather patterns and storm surges, land erosion, and groundwater intrusion. Over time, these conditions could result in declining \ndemand for space at our properties, delays in construction, resulting in increased construction costs, or in our inability to operate the \nbuildings at all. Climate change and severe weather may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of, or \ndecreasing the availability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable, by increasing the costs of energy, maintenance, repair of \nwater and/or wind damage, and snow removal at our properties.\nIn March 2022, the SEC released a proposed standard that would require quantitative disclosures of certain climate-related \nmetrics and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, including within the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements. On March 6, \n2024, the SEC adopted the new standards, with the rules originally set to take effect as of May 28, 2024. These rules would have \nrequired public companies to disclose information on (i) climate-related financial risks, (ii) GHG emissions, and (iii) climate-related \ntargets or transition plans. However, on April 4, 2024, the SEC issued an order to stay these rules pending judicial review following legal \nchallenges. As of the date of this report, the implementation of the new climate-related disclosures remains indefinitely delayed. We \ncontinue to monitor developments and assess the potential effect of these new standards, if implemented at all, on our future \nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, California introduced new climate-related reporting requirements under the Climate Corporate Data Accountability \nAct (SB 253) and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act (SB 261), which were signed into law in October 2023. These laws require \ncorporations doing business in California to annually report their GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 (SB 253) and to disclose \nclimate-related financial risks and risk mitigation strategies (SB 261). Reporting under these laws is phased in, with initial emissions \nreporting required in 2026 based on 2025 data, and climate risk disclosures commencing in 2026. Considering our operations in \nCalifornia, we continue to enhance our existing data collection, reporting, and assurance processes for climate-related metrics and \nrisks. \nIn August 2022, the U.S. Congress signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”), which directed nearly $400 \nbillion of federal spending to be used toward reducing carbon emissions and funding clean energy over the next 10 years and was \ndesigned to encourage private investment in clean energy, transport, and manufacturing. Since its inaugural year in 2023, nearly $500 \nbillion in new green investments and 334,000 new green jobs across the U.S. have been attributed to the IRA. However, long-term \nimpacts and benefits, if any, resulting from the IRA are still to be determined.\nNumerous states and municipalities have adopted state and local laws and policies on climate disclosures and climate change \nand emission reduction targets impacting the building sector. For example, the State of California enacted legislation requiring certain \ncompanies to disclose GHG emissions and climate-related financial risk information. Other cities, including Boston, Cambridge, New \nYork, and Seattle, have passed ordinances that set limits on GHG emissions associated with building operations. Some municipalities, \nincluding the Cities of New York and San Francisco, have also implemented legislation to eliminate the use of natural gas in new \nconstruction projects.\nPresident Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election, as well as the Republican Party’s gaining control of both the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives and Senate in the congressional election, may create regulatory uncertainty with respect to climate change \npolicy. During the election campaign, President Trump made comments suggesting that he was not supportive of various clean energy \nprograms and initiatives, including the United Nations (“U.N.”) Framework Convention on Climate Change, designed to curtail global \nwarming. On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, marking a \nsignificant shift in U.S. climate policy. It remains unclear what further actions President Trump may take with respect to domestic and \ninternational programs and initiatives, and what support the Trump administration would have for any potential changes to such \nlegislative programs and initiatives in the U.N. or the U.S. Congress.\nChanges in federal, state, and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in \nincreased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties (for example, to improve their energy \nefficiency and/or resistance to severe weather), and in our and our tenants’ increased compliance and other costs, without a \ncorresponding increase in revenue, which may result in adverse impacts to our and our tenants’ operating results. \nAlso, we rely on a limited number of vendors to provide key services, including, but not limited to, utilities and construction \nservices, at certain of our properties. If, as a result of unanticipated events, including those resulting from climate change, these \nvendors fail to adequately provide key services, we may experience significant interruptions in service and disruptions to business \noperations at our properties, incur remediation costs, and become subject to claims and damage to our reputation. Near\nly 40% o\nf the \nproperties we own and operate are located in California, where climate change has been linked to the progressively warmer and drier \nweather associated with ideal conditions for highly destructive wildfires. \n39\nFor example, most of our properties located in our San Francisco Bay Area market depend on PG&E for the delivery of electric \nand gas services. In January 2019, in response to potential liabilities arising from a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in \nNorthern California in 2017 and 2018, PG&E initiated voluntary reorganization proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy \nCode. While PG&E emerged from bankruptcy in July 2020, there is no guarantee that PG&E will be able to sustain safe operations and \ncontinue to provide consistent utilities services. During periods of high winds and high fire danger in recent fire seasons, PG&E has \npreemptively shut off power to areas of Central and Northern California. The shutoffs were designed to help guard against fires ignited \nin areas with high winds and dry conditions. PG&E has warned that it may have to employ shutoffs while the utility company addresses \nmaintenance issues. Future shutoffs of power may impact the reliability of access to a stable power supply at our properties. There is no \nguarantee that in the future climate change and severe weather will not adversely affect PG&E or any of our other key vendors, which in \nturn could have a material adverse effect on our properties and our tenants’ operations, as well as on our financial condition, results of \noperations, and cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that climate change and severe weather, or the potential impacts of these events on our vendors \nand suppliers, will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business.\nWe may incur significant costs in complying with environmental laws.\nFederal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations may require us, as a current or prior owner or operator of real \nestate, to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products released at or from any of our properties. The \ncost of investigating and remediating contamination could be substantial and could exceed the amount of any insurance coverage \navailable to us. In addition, the presence of contamination, or the failure to properly remediate, may adversely affect our ability to lease \nor sell an affected property, or to borrow funds using that property as collateral.\nUnder environmental laws and regulations, we may have to pay government entities or third parties for property damage and \nfor investigation and remediation costs incurred by those parties relating to contaminated properties regardless of whether we knew of \nor caused the contamination. Even if more than one party was responsible for the contamination, we may be held responsible for all of \nthe remediation costs. In addition, third parties may sue us for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination, or jointly \nresponsible parties may contest their responsibility or be financially unable to pay their share of such costs.\nEnvironmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing building materials. These \nlaws may impose fines and penalties on us for the release of asbestos-containing building materials and may allow third parties to seek \nrecovery from us for personal injury from exposure to asbestos fibers. We have detected asbestos-containing building materials at \nsome of our properties, but we do not expect that they will result in material environmental costs or liabilities for us.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations also require the removal or upgrading of certain underground storage tanks and regulate:\n•\nThe discharge of stormwater, wastewater, and any water pollutants;\n•\nThe emission of air pollutants;\n•\nThe generation, management, and disposal of hazardous or toxic chemicals, substances, or wastes; and\n•\nWorkplace health and safety.\nMany of our tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties. \nEnvironmental laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental \nliabilities could also affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. We require our tenants to comply with these environmental \nlaws and regulations and to indemnify us against any related liabilities.\nIndependent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental assessments at our properties. We \nintend to use consultants to conduct similar environmental assessments on our future acquisitions. These types of assessments \ngenerally include a site inspection, interviews, and a public records review, but no subsurface sampling. These assessments and \ncertain additional investigations of our properties have not to date revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations.\nAdditional investigations have included, as appropriate:\n•\nAsbestos surveys;\n•\nRadon surveys;\n•\nLead-based paint surveys;\n•\nMold surveys;\n•\nAdditional public records review;\n•\nSubsurface sampling; and\n•\nOther testing.\n40\nNevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our current properties have not revealed, and that assessments on future \nacquisitions will not reveal, all environmental liabilities. Consequently, there may be material environmental liabilities of which we are \nunaware that may result in substantial costs to us or our tenants and that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEnvironmental, health, or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements. Costs and capital expenditures \nrelating to the evolving requirements depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of new standards. As discussed in the \nimmediately preceding risk factor, due to concern over the risks of climate change, a more restrictive regulatory framework to reduce \nGHG pollution might be implemented, including the adoption of carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, and increased efficiency standards. \nThese requirements could make our operations more expensive and lengthen our project timelines. The costs of complying with \nevolving regulatory requirements, including GHG regulations and policies, could negatively impact our financial results. Moreover, \nchanges in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations or require modifications to our facilities. Accordingly, \nenvironmental, health, or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities and could have a material \nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and the market price of our common stock. \nWe may be unable to meet our sustainability goals. \nWe seek to make a positive and meaningful impact on the health, safety, and well-being of our tenants, stockholders, \nemployees, and the communities in which we live and work. In support of these efforts, we have set sustainability goals for \ndevelopment projects, including energy and water use reduction, diversion of construction waste from landfills, and targeted levels of \ncertification by third-party green and healthy building rating organizations and programs. For our operating properties, we have set a \n2030 target to reduce operational emissions per RSF, and we continue to pursue measures aimed at reducing water consumption and \nincreasing waste diversion. There are significant risks that may prevent us from achieving such goals, including, but not limited to, the \nfollowing possibilities:\n•\nChange in market conditions may affect our ability to deploy capital for projects such as those that reduce energy, water \nconsumption, and GHG emissions and that provide waste savings.\n•\nThe quantity of investment-grade renewable energy projects that can be contracted and constructed by 2030 has \ndecreased in recent years due to factors such as backlogs in regional transmission organizations’ interconnection queues \nand higher demand from large buyers. Additionally, the cost of contracts for new renewable energy (power purchase \nagreements and virtual power purchase agreements) has increased in recent years due to such factors as higher material \nand labor costs, interconnection backlogs, and increased demand for renewable energy. Such changes in the availability \nand costs of renewable energy may impact our ability to procure renewable energy to reduce GHG emissions from \npurchased electricity.\n•\nOur tenants may be unwilling or unable to accept potential incremental expenses associated with sustainability programs, \nincluding expenses to comply with requirements stipulated under building certification standards such as LEED, Fitwel, \nand WELL.\nThe realization of any of the above risks could significantly impact our reputation, our ability to reduce operational emissions \nper RSF to meet our 2030 target, our ability to attract tenants that have set GHG emissions reduction goals and/or include LEED \ncertification among their priorities when selecting a location to lease, and our ability to continue developing properties in markets where \nhigh levels of LEED certification contribute to our efforts to obtain building permits and entitlements.\nWe may invest or spend the net proceeds from the offerings of our unsecured senior notes payable earmarked for \nEligible Green Projects (the “Green Bonds”) in ways investors may not agree with and in ways that may not earn a profit.\nThe respective net proceeds from issuances of Green Bonds are expected to be used to fund, in whole or in part, Eligible \nGreen Projects (as defined below), including the development and redevelopment of such projects. The net proceeds from these \nofferings are typically initially used to reduce the outstanding balance on our unsecured senior line of credit or amounts outstanding \nunder our commercial paper program. We then allocate the funds to recently completed and future Eligible Green Projects. ‘‘Eligible \nGreen Projects’’ are defined as:\n•\nNew Class A/A+ development properties that have received or are expected to receive LEED Gold or Platinum  \ncertification;\n•\nExisting Class A/A+ redevelopment properties that have received or are expected to receive LEED Gold or Platinum \ncertification; and\n•\nTenant improvements that have received or are expected to receive LEED Gold or Platinum certification.\n41\nEligible Green Projects include projects with disbursements made in the three years preceding the applicable issue date of the \nGreen Bonds. We intend to spend the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the Green Bonds within two years following the \napplicable issue date of the Green Bonds. LEED is a voluntary, third-party building certification process developed by the U.S. Green \nBuilding Council (‘‘USGBC’’), a non-profit organization. The USGBC developed the LEED certification process to (i) evaluate the \nenvironmental performance from a whole-building perspective over a building’s life cycle, (ii) provide a definitive standard for what \nconstitutes a ‘‘green building,’’ (iii) enhance environmental awareness among architects and building contractors, and (iv) encourage the \ndesign and construction of energy-efficient, water-conserving buildings that use sustainable or green resources and materials.\nThere can be no assurance that the projects funded with the proceeds from the Green Bonds will meet investor criteria and \nexpectations regarding environmental impact and sustainability performance. In particular, no assurance is given that the use of such \nproceeds for any Eligible Green Projects will satisfy, whether in whole or in part, any present or future investor expectations or \nrequirements regarding any investment criteria or guidelines with which such investor or its investments are required to comply, whether \nby any present or future applicable law or regulations or by its own bylaws or other governing rules or investment portfolio mandates (in \nparticular, with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability, or social impact of any projects or uses, the subject of or \nrelated to, the relevant Eligible Green Projects). Adverse environmental or social impacts may occur during the design, construction, \nand operation of the projects, or the projects may become controversial or criticized by activist groups or other stakeholders. In addition, \nalthough we will limit the use of proceeds from the Green Bonds to Eligible Green Projects, there can be no assurance that one or more \ndevelopment, redevelopment, and tenant improvement projects that we expect will receive a LEED certification will actually receive \nsuch certification. Furthermore, from time to time, we may refinance our debt to take advantage of lower market rates or other favorable \nterms, and we may pursue this strategy in the future in connection with our Green Bonds. If the terms of the refinanced agreements set \ndifferent or no restrictions on the range of purposes the funds can be allocated to, we can provide no assurance that allocations to \nfuture Eligible Green Projects established prior to the refinancing of our Green Bonds will remain unchanged after the refinancing has \nbeen completed. \nChanges in U.S. accounting standards may adversely impact us.\nThe regulatory boards and government agencies that determine financial accounting standards and disclosures in the U.S., \nwhich include the FASB and the SEC, continually change and update the financial accounting standards we must follow. \nFrom time to time, the FASB issues ASUs that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations, \nwhich in turn could also significantly impact the market price of our common stock. Such potential impacts include, without limitation, \nsignificant changes to our balance sheet, significant changes to the timing or methodology of revenue or expense recognition, or \nsignificant fluctuations in our reported results of operations, including an increase in our operating expenses or general and \nadministrative expenses related to payroll costs, legal costs, and other out-of-pocket costs incurred in order to comply with the \nrequirements of these ASUs.\nAny difficulties in the implementation of changes in accounting principles, including the ability to modify our accounting \nsystems and to update our policies, procedures, information systems, and internal control over financial reporting, could result in \nmaterially inaccurate financial statements, which in turn could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting \nobligations. Significant changes that may be introduced by ASUs could cause fluctuations in revenue and expense recognition and \nmaterially affect our results of operations. We may also experience an increase in general and administrative expenses resulting from \nadditional resources required for the initial implementation of such ASUs. This could adversely affect our reported results of operations, \nprofitability, and financial statements. Additionally, the adoption of new accounting standards could affect the results of our debt \ncovenant calculations. It cannot be assured that we will be able to work with our lenders to successfully amend our debt covenants in \nresponse to changes in accounting standards.\nWe are subject to evolving privacy and information security laws, regulations, policies, and contractual obligations \nrelated to data privacy and security. Changes to these requirements, or our noncompliance therewith, could subject us to \nfines or penalties, increased costs of doing business, compliance risks, and potential liability and could materially and \nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \nIn the ordinary course of business, we handle personal data and other sensitive information, including that of our tenants, \nvendors, and employees. As such, we are subject to numerous data privacy and security mandates, including laws, regulations, \nexternal and internal data privacy and security policies, and contractual requirements. \nFor example, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became effective on January 1, 2023, significantly expanded \nthe definition of “consumer,” originally defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), to include job applicants, employees, \nand independent contractors. Additionally, the CPRA introduced new rights of consumers to limit the use of their sensitive personal \ninformation and mandated employers disclose personal information usage, an individual’s rights under the CCPA, and their personal \ninformation retention period or the criteria they use to determine their retention period. \n42\nThe CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to consumers, business entities, and residents of California. It \nbroadly defined “personal information,” providing California residents with expanded privacy rights and protections, and established civil \npenalties for violations for certain data breaches. It also enabled California residents to opt out of the sales of their personal information, \nwith noncompliant businesses facing significant penalties. \nWe have taken actions to proactively enhance our handling of personal information, including, but not limited to:\n•\nUpdating external and internal privacy notices and policies;\n•\nImplementing procedures to comply with the CCPA and CPRA, including procedures to effectively address potential requests \nfrom California residents, including our employees, regarding their personal information; \n•\nRevising our document retention policy to minimize the storage of information subject to the CCPA and CPRA; and \n•\nAmending contracts with our partners and vendors to incorporate data use restrictions, security measures, and other required \nprovisions. \nHowever, there is no guarantee that we will adequately address the requirements of the CCPA and CPRA, or evolving laws in \nother jurisdictions. The data privacy and security landscape is becoming increasingly complex. Differing regulations may result in \ninconsistent applications and interpretations across multiple jurisdictions. As such, we may be required to devote significant resources \nand implement or significantly change existing technologies, systems, or practices in order to prepare for and comply with new \nregulations. Our failure to comply with applicable federal, state, and local privacy laws could lead to:\n•\nDamage to our reputation;\n•\nIncreased remediation and compliance costs;\n•\nGovernment investigations and enforcement actions;\n•\nFines, penalties, or litigation, including class actions;\n•\nChallenges in raising capital; and\n•\nInability to execute on our business strategy, including our growth plans.\nChanges in the aforementioned laws may subject us to increased compliance risks and potential liability, and materially and \nadversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our information technology networks or data, or those of third parties with whom we work, are or were disrupted or \notherwise compromised, we could experience adverse consequences resulting from such compromise, including, but not \nlimited to, costly remediation or other expenses, liability under federal and state laws, litigation and investigations, \nreputational damage, disruptions to our business operations, decreased cash flows, and other adverse consequences. \nInformation technology, communication networks, enterprise applications, and related systems, including those in our \nproperties, are essential to the operation of our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we use these systems to service our \ntenants, manage our tenant and vendor relationships, and for internal communications, accounting, financial reporting, record-keeping, \nand many other key aspects of our business. These operations rely on the secure collection, storage, transmission, and other \nprocessing of confidential and other sensitive information in our computer systems and networks and subject us, and the third parties \nwith whom we work, to a variety of evolving threats, including, but not limited to, ransomware attacks, which could cause security \nincidents. \nCyberattacks, malicious Internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities threaten the confidentiality, \nintegrity, and availability of our confidential, proprietary, and sensitive data and information technology systems, and those of the third \nparties with whom we work. Such threats are prevalent and continue to rise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety \nof sources, including traditional computer “hackers,” threat actors, “hacktivists,” organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as \nthrough theft or misuse), sophisticated nation states, and nation-state-supported actors.\nSome actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyberattacks, including, without limitation, nation-state \nactors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major \nconflicts, we and the third parties with whom we work may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including retaliatory \ncyberattacks, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell, and distribute our \nservices.  \n43\nWe and the third parties with whom we work are subject to a variety of evolving threats, including, but not limited to, physical \nbreak-ins; disruptions due to power outages or catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes; breaches of our \nsecure network by an unauthorized party (including those caused by supply chain breaches); software vulnerabilities or bugs; malware \n(including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions); malicious code (such as computer viruses and worms); attachments to \nemails; denial-of-service attacks; credential stuffing; credential harvesting; employee error, theft, or misuse; social engineering attacks \n(including through deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, and phishing attacks); ransomware attacks; \nserver malfunctions; software or hardware failures; loss of data or other information technology assets; adware; telecommunications \nfailures; attacks enhanced or facilitated by AI; or other similar threats. For example, we have been the target of phishing attempts in the \npast and expect such attempts will continue in the future.  \nIn particular, severe ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and can lead to significant interruptions in our \noperations and properties; loss of confidential, proprietary, and sensitive data; reputational harm; loss of income; and diversion of funds. \nExtortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such \npayments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments.\nRemote work has increased risks to our information technology systems and confidential, proprietary, and sensitive data as \nmore of our employees utilize network connections, computers, and devices outside our premises or network, including working at \nhome, while in transit, and in public locations. Future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose \nus to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired \nor integrated entities’ systems and technologies outside of our control. Furthermore, we may discover security issues that were not \nfound during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate companies into our information \ntechnology environment and security program. \nIn addition, our reliance on third parties introduces new cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, including supply chain attacks, \nand other threats to our business operations. We rely on third parties and technologies to operate critical business systems to process \nconfidential, proprietary, and sensitive data in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center \nfacilities, encryption and authentication technology, employee emails, and other functions. We also rely on third parties to provide other \nproducts, services, or otherwise to operate our business. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is \nlimited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. When the third parties with whom we \nwork experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. While we may be entitled to \ndamages if the third parties with whom we work fail to satisfy their data privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award may be \ninsufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award. In addition, supply chain attacks have increased in \nfrequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties’ infrastructure in our supply chain or that of the third parties with \nwhom we work have not been compromised.\nWe may expend significant resources or modify our business activities to try to protect against security incidents. Additionally, \ncertain data privacy and security obligations may require us to implement and maintain certain security measures or industry-standard \nor reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and confidential, proprietary, and sensitive data.\nWhile we have implemented security measures designed to safeguard our systems and confidential, proprietary, and sensitive \ndata from security incidents and to manage cybersecurity risks, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. We \ntake steps to monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure and invest in the development and \nenhancement of our controls designed to prevent, detect, respond to, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer \nviruses, and other events that could have a security impact. Additionally, we take steps designed to detect, mitigate, and remediate \nvulnerabilities in our information systems (such as our hardware and/or software, including that of third parties with whom we work), but \nwe may not be able to detect and remediate all such vulnerabilities including on a timely basis. Further, we may experience delays in \ndeveloping and deploying remedial measures and patches designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could \nbe exploited and result in a security incident.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that could result in \nunauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to our \nconfidential, proprietary, and sensitive data or our information technology systems, or those of the third parties with whom we work. A \nsecurity incident or other interruption involving our information systems or those of our tenants, vendors, software creators, cloud \nproviders, cybersecurity service providers, or other third parties with whom we work could lead to, among other things:\n•\nTheft of our cash, cash equivalents, or other liquid assets, including publicly traded securities;\n•\nUnauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation, or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive, or \notherwise valuable information of ours or our tenants, and other business partners, which could be used to compete \nagainst us or for disruptive, destructive, or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n•\nOur inability to produce financial and operational data necessary to comply with rules and regulations from the SEC, the \nIRS, or other state and federal regulatory agencies;\n•\nOur inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT;\n•\nViolation of our lease agreements or other agreements; \n•\nDifficulties in employee retention and recruitment; \n44\n•\nUnauthorized access to, and destruction, disruption, loss, or denial of service to our buildings;\n•\nIncrease in the cost of proactive defensive measures to prevent future cyber incidents, including hiring personnel and \nconsultants or investing in additional technologies; and \n•\nIncrease in our cybersecurity insurance premiums.\nFurthermore, the extent of a particular security incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the security \nincident may not be immediately clear. Therefore, in the event of a security incident, it may take a significant amount of time before such \nan investigation can be completed. During an investigation, we may not necessarily know the extent of the damage incurred or how \nbest to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, which \ncould further increase the costs and consequences of a security incident. Additionally, applicable data privacy and security obligations \nmay require us to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators, and investors of security incidents \nor to implement other requirements, such as providing credit monitoring. Such disclosures and compliance with such requirements are \ncostly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such disclosure requirements could lead to adverse consequences.\nIf we (or a third party with whom we work) experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security \nincident, we may experience material adverse consequences, such as government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, \nfines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive \ninformation (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational \nharm; monetary fund diversions; diversion of management attention; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data); \nfinancial loss; and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant material consequences may prevent or cause customers to \nstop using our services, deter new customers from using our products/services, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate \nour business.\nOur contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of \nliability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security \nobligations. We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities \narising out of our data privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms \nor at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims.\nIn addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information about us from \npublic sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to \nundermine our competitive advantage or market position. Additionally, proprietary, confidential, and/or sensitive information of the \nCompany or our tenants could be leaked, disclosed, or revealed as a result of or in connection with our employees’, personnel’s, or \nvendors’ use of generative artificial intelligence technologies.\nEven if we are not targeted directly, cyberattacks on the U.S. government, financial markets, financial institutions, or other \nbusinesses, including our tenants, vendors, software creators, cloud providers, cybersecurity service providers, and other third parties \nwith whom we work, may occur, and such events could disrupt our normal business operations and networks in the future.\nThe increased use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and automation in life science research and development (“R&D”) \nactivities may change the uses, space configurations, and tenant requirements for our laboratory properties in currently \nunforeseen ways.\nIn recent years, some life science companies have augmented their traditional laboratory-based R&D efforts by integrating AI, \ncloud computing, quantum computing, and other advanced computational technologies into their R&D programs. It is expected that \nsuch technologies will accelerate and streamline a number of R&D functions, including, for example, through the targeted design and \nevaluation of clinical trials and the efficient identification of the most promising drug development candidates from among multiple \npossible drugs. In addition, life science companies, like companies in many other industries, are increasingly integrating new \ntechnologies, such as robotics and advanced automation of recurring tasks, into their businesses, including their R&D activities. It is \nwidely thought that the life science and healthcare industries, like most industries, are in only the early stages of an advanced \ntechnology revolution that may have profound, and largely currently unknown, impacts on their businesses, including the processes and \nstrategies underlying R&D and commercialization of new products.  \nWe have always strived to provide our tenants with state-of-the-art laboratory facilities incorporating cutting-edge infrastructure \nfeatures (including energy delivery, environmental, sustainability, security, and waste disposal features) to enable our tenants to perform \nat the highest levels. It is currently unknown how the ongoing adoption of advanced technologies and automation in the life science \nindustry will impact the optimal space configurations and infrastructure features of the “laboratory of the future,” and we may face new \ntenant requirements and requests that will require significant expenditures that may not be entirely recoverable through increased rents. \nFor example, the adoption of AI by our tenants may lead to infrastructure requirements that our buildings currently do not \naccommodate, such as increased power needs due to high-performance computing. Infrastructure upgrades may necessitate \nsubstantial capital expenditures and could potentially impact the environmental footprint of our building operations.\n45\nIf technological developments result in a reduction or reconfiguration in space requirements by our tenants, demand by \nindividual tenants and prospective tenants for space may decrease over time. If we are not able to offset any reduction in demand from \nthe foregoing developments through repurposing space, property dispositions, or other means, the realization of any of the \naforementioned risks could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, net operating income, results of operations, funds from \noperations, operating margins, occupancy, earnings per share, FFO per share, our overall business, and the market value of our \ncommon stock.\nGeneral risk factors\nWe face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.\nFrom time to time, we may have significant cash balances that we invested in a variety of short-term investments that are \nintended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. These investments may \ninclude (either directly or indirectly) obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks, money market funds, treasury bank \nsecurities, and other short-term securities. Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. Under \ncertain circumstances, we may be required to redeem all or part of these securities or funds at less than par value. A decline in the \nvalue of our investments, or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem them, may have a material adverse effect on our results of \noperations or financial condition and our ability to pay our obligations as they become due.\nCompetition for skilled personnel could increase labor costs.\nWe compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel. We depend on our ability \nto attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Company. Competitive \npressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel. We may not be able to \noffset such additional costs by increasing the rates we charge tenants. If there is an increase in these costs or if we fail to attract and \nretain qualified and skilled personnel, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nFailure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge agreements to manage some of our exposure to interest rate \nvolatility. Interest rate hedge agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under \nthese arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates. These \nrisk factors may lead to failure to hedge effectively against changes in interest rates and therefore could adversely affect our results of \noperations. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had no interest rate hedge agreements outstanding.\nMarket volatility may negatively affect our business.\nFrom time to time, the capital and credit markets experience volatility. In some cases, the markets have produced downward \npressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial and/or operating \nstrength. If market disruption and volatility occur, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may \nbe material, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Market disruption and volatility may adversely affect the \nvalue of the companies in which we hold equity investments, including through our non-real estate venture investment portfolio, and we \nmay be required to recognize losses in our earnings. Disruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the capital markets may also limit our \naccess to capital from financial institutions on favorable terms, or altogether, and our ability to raise capital through the issuance of \nequity securities could be adversely affected by causes beyond our control through extraordinary disruptions in the global economy and \nfinancial systems or through other events.\nChanges in financial accounting standards may adversely impact our compliance with financial debt covenants\n.\nOur unsecured senior notes payable contain financial covenants that are calculated based on GAAP at the date the \ninstruments were issued. However, certain debt agreements, including those related to our unsecured senior line of credit, contain \nfinancial covenants whose calculations are based on current GAAP, which is subject to future changes. Our unsecured senior line of \ncredit agreement provides that our financial debt covenants be renegotiated in good faith to preserve the original intent of the existing \nfinancial covenant when such covenant is affected by an accounting standard change. For those debt agreements that require the \nrenegotiation of financial covenants upon changes in accounting standards, there is no assurance that we will be successful in such \nnegotiations or that the renegotiated covenants will not be more restrictive to us.\n46\nExtreme weather and natural or other unforeseen disasters may cause property damage or disrupt operations, which \ncould harm our business and operating results.\nWe have properties located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather and natural or other disasters, including, but not \nlimited to, earthquakes, winds, floods, hurricanes, fires, power shortages, telecommunication failures, medical epidemics, explosions, or \nother natural or man-made accidents or incidents. Our corporate headquarters and certain properties are located in areas of California \nthat have historically been subject to earthquakes and wildfires. Such conditions and disastrous events may damage our properties, \ndisrupt our operations, or adversely impact our tenants’ or third-party vendors’ operations. These events may affect our ability to operate \nour business and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating results. Damage caused by these events may \nresult in costly repairs for damaged properties or equipment, delays in the development or redevelopment of our construction projects, \nor interruption of our daily business operations, which may result in increased costs and decreased revenues.\nWe maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are appropriate for our business. However, we cannot be certain \nthat the amount of coverage will be adequate to satisfy damages or losses incurred in the event of another wildfire or other natural or \nman-made disaster, which may lead to a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, and our business, or those of our \ntenants.\nFailure of the U.S. federal government to manage its fiscal matters or to avoid a government shutdown may \nnegatively impact the economic environment and adversely impact our results of operations.\nCongressional disagreement over the federal budget and the maximum amount of debt the federal government is permitted to \nhave outstanding (commonly referred to as the “debt ceiling”) has previously caused the U.S. federal government to shut down for \nperiods of time. Generally, if effective legislation to fund government operations and manage the level of federal debt is not enacted, the \nfederal government may suspend its investments for certain government accounts, among other available options, in order to prioritize \npayments on its obligations. A failure by the U.S. Congress to pass spending bills or address the debt ceiling at any point in the future \nwould increase the risk of default by the U.S. on its obligations, the risk of a lowering of the U.S. federal government’s credit rating, and \nthe risk of other economic dislocations. Such a failure, or the perceived risk of such a failure, could consequently have a material \nadverse effect on the financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S. and globally. Twice in the past decade, by the \nappropriations legislation deadline, Congress failed to pass a new appropriations bill or continuing resolution to temporarily extend \nfunding, resulting in U.S. government shutdowns that caused federal agencies to halt non-essential operations. If economic conditions \nseverely deteriorate as a result of U.S. federal government fiscal gridlock, our operations, or those of our tenants, could be affected, \nwhich may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. These risks may also impact our overall liquidity, our \nborrowing costs, or the market price of our common stock\n.\nChanges in laws, regulations, and financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of \noperations.\nAs a response, in large part, to perceived abuses and deficiencies in current regulations believed to have caused or \nexacerbated the 2008 global financial crisis, legislative, regulatory, and accounting standard-setting bodies around the world are \nengaged in an intensive, wide-ranging examination and rewriting of the laws, regulations, and accounting standards that have \nconstituted the basic playing field of global and domestic business for several decades. In many jurisdictions, including the U.S., the \nlegislative and regulatory response has included the extensive reorganization of existing regulatory and rule-making agencies and \norganizations, and the establishment of new agencies with broad powers. This reorganization has disturbed longstanding regulatory \nand industry relationships and established procedures.\nThe rule-making and administrative efforts have focused principally on the areas perceived as having contributed to the \nfinancial crisis, including banking, investment banking, securities regulation, and real estate finance, with spillover impacts on many \nother areas. These initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry, and \nmany other businesses, that is unprecedented in the U.S. at least since the wave of lawmaking, regulatory reform, and government \nreorganization that followed the Great Depression.\nThe global financial crisis and the aggressive reaction of the government and accounting profession thereto have occurred \nagainst a backdrop of increasing globalization and internationalization of financial and securities regulation that began prior to the 2008 \nfinancial crisis. As a result of this ongoing trend, financial and investment activities previously regulated almost exclusively at a local or \nnational level are increasingly being regulated, or at least coordinated, on an international basis, with national rule-making and \nstandard-setting groups relinquishing varying degrees of local and national control to achieve more uniform regulation and reduce the \nability of market participants to engage in regulatory arbitrage between jurisdictions. This globalization trend has continued, arguably \nwith an increased sense of urgency and importance, since the financial crisis.\nThis high degree of regulatory uncertainty, coupled with considerable additional uncertainty regarding the underlying condition \nand prospects of global, domestic, and local economies, has created a business environment that makes business planning and \nprojections even more uncertain than is ordinarily the case for businesses in the financial and real estate sectors.\n47\nIn the commercial real estate sector in which we operate, the uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-\nsetting authorities to fundamentally rewrite major bodies of accounting literature constitute a significant source of uncertainty as to the \nbasic rules of business engagement. Changes in accounting standards may have a significant effect on our financial results and on the \nresults of our tenants, which would in turn have a secondary impact on us.  \nGlobal financial stressors, high structural unemployment levels, and other events or circumstances beyond our \ncontrol may adversely affect our industry, business, results of operations, contractual commitments, and access to capital.\nFrom 2008 through 2010, significant concerns over energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the \nU.S. mortgage market, and a declining real estate market in the U.S. contributed to increased volatility, diminished expectations for the \neconomy and the markets, and high levels of structural unemployment by historical standards. These factors, combined with volatile oil \nprices and fluctuating business and consumer confidence, precipitated a steep economic decline. Further, severe financial and \nstructural strains on the banking and financial systems have led to significant lack of trust and confidence in the global credit and \nfinancial system. Consumers and money managers have liquidated and may liquidate equity investments, and consumers and banks \nhave held and may hold cash and other lower-risk investments, which has resulted in significant and, in some cases, catastrophic \ndeclines in the equity capitalization of companies and failures of financial institutions. Although U.S. bank earnings and liquidity have \nrebounded, the potential of significant future bank credit losses creates uncertainty for the lending outlook.\nDowngrades of the U.S. federal government’s sovereign credit rating and an economic crisis in Europe could \nnegatively impact our liquidity, financial condition, and earnings.\nPrevious U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns, together with sovereign debt conditions in Europe, have increased the \npossibility of additional downgrades of sovereign credit ratings and economic slowdowns. There is no guarantee that future debt ceiling \nor federal spending legislation will not fail and cause the U.S. to default on its obligations, which would likely cause the U.S. credit rating \nto degrade.\nS&P Global Ratings lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating of the U.S. from “AAA” to “AA+” in 2011, which it affirmed in \n2024. Similarly, Fitch Ratings downgraded the sovereign credit rating of the U.S. from “AAA” to “AA+” in 2023 and affirmed the “AA+” \nrating in 2024\n. However, further fiscal impasses within the federal government may result in future downgrades. The impact of any \nfurther downgrades to the U.S. government’s sovereign credit rating, or its perceived creditworthiness, is inherently unpredictable and \ncould adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions. This could cause further increases in interest \nrates and borrowing costs, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. In addition, the \nlowered credit rating could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which may exert downward pressure on the market price of \nour common stock. Continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, \nand results of operations.\nEconomic and social volatility and geopolitical instability outside of the U.S. due to large-scale conflicts, including \nwarfare among countries, may adversely impact us, the U.S., and global economies. \nFrom time to time, tensions between countries may erupt into warfare and may adversely affect neighboring countries and \nthose who conduct trade or foreign relations with those affected regions. Such acts of war may cause widespread and lingering damage \non a global scale, including, but not limited to, (i) safety and cyber security, (ii) the economy, and (iii) global relations.\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. In response to the invasion and ensuing war, many countries, including the U.S., \nimposed significant economic and other sanctions against Russia. The war has created the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World \nWar II and has inflicted significant damage to Ukraine’s infrastructure and economy. Both countries’ economies may be significantly \naffected, which may also adversely impact the global economy, including that of the U.S. Further, Russia has launched an onslaught of \ncyberwarfare against Ukraine following its invasion, targeting the country’s critical infrastructure, government agencies, media \norganizations, and related think tanks in the U.S. and EU.\nThe U.S. federal government has cautioned Americans on the possibility of Russia targeting the U.S. with cyberattacks in \nretaliation for sanctions that the U.S. has imposed and has urged both the public and private sectors to strengthen their cyber defenses \nand protect critical services and infrastructure. Additionally, President Biden directed government bodies to mandate cybersecurity and \nnetwork defense measures within their respective jurisdictions and has initiated action plans to reinforce cybersecurity within the \nelectricity, pipeline, and water sectors. The Biden administration also launched joint efforts with CISA through its “Shields Up” campaign \nto defend the U.S. against possible cyberattacks. CISA published advisories warning of Russian state-sponsored threat actors targeting \n“COVID-19 research, governments, election organizations, healthcare and pharmaceutical, defense, energy, video gaming, nuclear, \ncommercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing” sectors in the U.S. and other Western nations. While we have not \nexperienced such cyberattacks to date, it is yet unknown whether Russia will be successful in breaching our network defenses or, more \nbroadly, those within the areas listed above, which, if successful, may cause disruptions to critical infrastructure required for our \noperations and livelihoods, or those of our tenants, communities, and business partners.\n Disruption, instability, volatility, and decline in economic activity, regardless of where it occurs, whether caused by acts of war, \nother acts of aggression, or terrorism, could in turn also harm the demand for, the safety of, and the value of our properties. As a result \n48\nof the factors discussed above, we may be unable to operate our business as usual, which may adversely affect our cash flows, \nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nAdoption of the Basel III standards and other regulatory standards affecting financial institutions may negatively \nimpact our access to financing or affect the terms of our future financing arrangements.\nIn response to various financial crises and the volatility of financial markets, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the \n“Basel Committee”) adopted the Basel III regulatory capital framework (“Basel III” or the “Basel III Standards”). The final package of \nBasel III reforms was approved by the G20 leaders in November 2010. However, due to global events and industry feedback, the \nimplementation timeline has been extended multiple times. The final regulations are tentatively set to be released and to take effect by \nmid-2025.\nU.S. regulators have implemented various measures under the Basel III framework, including supplementary leverage ratio \nstandards (SLR Standards) and a risk-based capital surcharge for global systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs), fully \neffective as of 2019. Additionally, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), finalized in 2014, aims to enhance the resilience of internationally \nactive banks by requiring adequate high-quality liquid assets to cover net cash outflows, with stricter U.S. requirements phased in by \n2017.\nThe Volcker Rule, introduced under the Dodd-Frank Act, restricts proprietary trading and certain relationships with private \nequity and hedge funds. Amendments in 2020 simplified compliance and reduced restrictions, but further changes to “covered funds” \nare anticipated. These regulations, alongside the Basel Committee’s deferred final Basel III implementation now targeted for July 2025, \nmay increase capital requirements and constrain financing availability or terms from both U.S. and foreign financial institutions.\nSocial, political, and economic changes or instability, and other circumstances beyond our control could adversely \naffect our business operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by social, political, and economic instability, unrest, or disruption in a geographic \nregion in which we operate, regardless of cause, including legal, regulatory, and policy changes by a new presidential administration in \nthe U.S., protests, demonstrations, strikes, riots, civil disturbance, disobedience, insurrection, or social and other political unrest. \nSuch events may result in restrictions, curfews, or other actions and give rise to significant changes in regional and global \neconomic conditions and cycles, which may adversely affect our financial condition and operations. For example, past instances of \nunrest in cities throughout the U.S. in connection with civil rights, liberties, and social and governmental reform led in some locations to \nthe imposition of mandatory curfews and deployment of the U.S. National Guard. Government actions in an effort to protect people and \nproperty, including curfews and restrictions on business operations, may disrupt operations, harm perceptions of personal well-being, \nand increase the need for additional expenditures on security resources. In addition, action resulting from such social or political unrest \nmay pose significant risks to our personnel, facilities, and operations. We cannot ensure there will not be further political or social unrest \nin the future or that there will not be other events that could lead to social, political, and economic disruptions. If such events or \ndisruptions persist for a prolonged period of time, our overall business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nChanges in federal policy, including tax policies, and at regulatory agencies occur over time through policy and personnel \nchanges following elections, which can lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on certain industries and corporate \nentities. For example, as a federal government contractor, we maintain plans to ensure compliance with nondiscrimination and \nregulatory requirements for qualified employees on the basis of gender, race, disability, and veteran status. Consequently, we may be \nsubject to executive orders and regulatory changes affecting various aspects of our operations, including compliance with \nnondiscrimination plans. Any required elimination or modification of such plans in response to new executive orders could pose \nchallenges in hiring or retaining employees, and may lead to other adverse operational impacts. Failure to comply with these \nrequirements could expose us to administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including fines, penalties, repayments, or suspension  or \ndebarment from eligibility for future U.S. government contracts. \nThe nature, timing, and economic and political effects of potential changes to the current legal and regulatory frameworks \naffecting the life science industry, as well as the real estate industry in general, remain highly uncertain. For example, any proposals to \nmake changes related to U.S. tax law, including those related to Section 1031 Exchanges, may have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. From time to time, we dispose of properties in transactions \nqualified as Section 1031 Exchanges. If the laws surrounding Section 1031 Exchanges were amended or repealed, we may not be able \nto dispose of properties on a tax-deferred basis. In such a case, our earnings and profits and our taxable income would increase, which \ncould increase dividend income and reduce the return of capital to our stockholders. As a result, we may be required to pay additional \ndividends to stockholders, or, if we do not pay additional dividends, our corporate income tax liability could increase and we may be \nsubject to interest and penalties.\nSimilarly, changes in federal policy that affect the geopolitical landscape could give rise to circumstances outside our control \nthat could have negative impacts on our business operations. During the prior Trump administration, increased tariffs were implemented \non goods imported into the U.S., particularly from China, Canada, and Mexico. As China was and is a major global exporter of steel, \nsolar panels, and aluminum, the tariffs on these specific imports led to a trade war between not only the U.S. and China, but also \n49\nbetween the U.S. and the international community. Other countries, including China, Canada, and the EU, implemented retaliatory \ntariffs in response to these policies on U.S. goods. During the 2024 presidential campaign, President Trump pledged to impose an \nadditional 25% tariff on certain exports from Canada and Mexico, and up to an additional 60% tariff on certain exports from China. \nThese and similar types of trade policies could lead to issues with global supply chains on a macroeconomic scale, including steel, \npharmaceuticals, and construction equipment, all of which are critical to our and our tenant’s businesses. For example, several of our \nlargest tenants are European companies whose U.S. business operations could be directly impacted by the tariffs on the EU due to \nincreased costs on operations and supply chains. Similarly, many of our tenants are in the pharmaceutical industry. As China is a global \nleader in the market for active pharmaceutical ingredients, the imposition of tariffs, especially at such unprecedented rates, could \npotentially raise the cost of generic drugs in the U.S., which would in turn have direct consequences on our tenants in the \npharmaceutical industry. Such tariffs and changes to U.S. trade policy previously had, and in the future could, lead to further adverse \neffects on the U.S. domestic economy and our or our tenant’s businesses. \nTerrorist attacks may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of \nour assets.\nTerrorist attacks such as those that took place on September 11, 2001, could have a material adverse impact on our business, \nour operating results, and the market price of our common stock. Future foreign or domestic terrorist attacks may result in declining \neconomic activity, which could reduce the demand for, and the value of, our properties. To the extent that any future foreign or domestic \nterrorist attacks impact our tenants, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor \ntheir lease obligations.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures.\nDespite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures, and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our \ninternal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer \nviruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunications failures. Any system failure \nor accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. We may also incur additional \nsignificant costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions.\nShort sellers may engage in manipulative activity intended to drive down the market price of our common stock, \nwhich could result in a material diversion of our management’s time and may also lead to related governmental or regulatory \ninquiries or other legal actions, among other effects.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from \na third party with the intention of subsequently buying lower-priced identical securities to return to the lender. Accordingly, it is in the \ninterest of a short seller to want the price of our common stock to decline. At any time, short sellers may publish, or arrange for the \ndissemination of, opinions, or characterizations that are intended to create negative market momentum, including through the use of \nsocial media. In light of the recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence tools and large language models, there is also a risk \nthat the dissemination of such opinions, characterizations or disinformation may negatively impact the conclusions that these tools and \nmodels draw about our business and prospects.\nShort selling reports may potentially lead to increased volatility in an issuer’s stock price and to regulatory and governmental \ninquiries. In June 2023, a short seller published reports that contained certain negative and false allegations regarding our business and \nfinancial prospects. Regardless of merit, these allegations and false statements may spread quickly and diminish confidence in our \nbusiness, financial prospects, or reputation. As a result, maintaining or reinforcing our reputation may require us to devote significant \nresources to refuting incorrect or misleading allegations, pursuing or defending related legal actions, or engaging in other activities that \ncould be costly, time consuming, or unsuccessful. Additionally, any potential inquiry or formal investigation from a governmental \norganization or other regulatory body, including an inquiry from the SEC, arising from the presence of such allegations could result in a \nmaterial diversion of our management’s time and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe hold a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in deposit accounts that could be adversely affected if the \nfinancial institutions holding such deposits fail.\nWe\n \nmaintain our cash and cash equivalents at insured financial institutions. The combined account balances at each institution \nperiodically substantially exceed the FDIC insurance coverage of \n$250,000\n, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk\n \nrelated to amounts in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. As such, we may be subject to a risk of loss or delay in accessing all or a \nportion of our funds exceeding the FDIC insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our short-term liquidity, ability to operate our \nbusiness, and financial performance.\nAny or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash \nflows, or the market price of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we presently deem \nto be immaterial, may also have potential to materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n50\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY \nRisk management and strategy\nOur corporate information technology, communication networks, enterprise applications, accounting and financial reporting \nplatforms, and related systems, and those that we offer to our tenants are necessary for the operation of our business. We use these \nsystems, among others, to manage our tenant and vendor relationships, for internal communications, for accounting to operate record-\nkeeping function, and for many other key aspects of our business. Our business operations rely on the secure collection, storage, \ntransmission, and other processing of proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data. \nWe have implemented and maintain various information security processes designed to identify, assess and manage material \nrisks from cybersecurity threats to our critical computer networks, third-party hosted services, communications systems, hardware and \nsoftware, and our critical data, including intellectual property, confidential information that is proprietary, strategic or competitive in \nnature, and tenant data (“Information Systems and Data”).  \nWe rely on a multidisciplinary team, including our information security function, legal department, management, and third-party \nservice providers, as described further below, to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity threats and risks. We identify and assess \nrisks from cybersecurity threats by monitoring and evaluating our threat environment and our risk profile using various methods \nincluding, for example, using manual and automated tools, subscribing to reports and services that identify cybersecurity threats, \nanalyzing reports of threats and threat actors, conducting scans of the threat environment, evaluating our industry’s risk profile, utilizing \ninternal and external audits, and conducting threat and vulnerability assessments.  \nDepending on the environment, we implement and maintain various technical, physical, and organizational measures, \nprocesses, standards, and/or policies designed to manage and mitigate material risks from cybersecurity threats to our Information \nSystems and Data, including risk assessments,  incident detection and response, vulnerability management, disaster recovery and \nbusiness continuity plans, internal controls within our accounting and financial reporting functions, encryption of data, network security \ncontrols, access controls, physical security, asset management, systems monitoring, vendor risk management program, employee \ntraining, and penetration testing.\n \nWe work with third parties from time to time that assist us to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks, including \nprofessional services firms, consulting firms, threat intelligence service providers, and penetration testing firms.  \nTo operate our business, we utilize certain third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions. We seek to engage \nreliable, reputable service providers that maintain cybersecurity programs.\n \nDepending on the nature of the services provided, the \nsensitivity and quantity of information processed, and the identity of the service provider, our vendor management process may include \nreviewing the cybersecurity practices of such provider, contractually imposing obligations on the provider, conducting security \nassessments, and conducting periodic reassessments during their engagement.\n  \nWe are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any cybersecurity incidents, which have \nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our Company, including our business strategy, results of operations, or \nfinancial condition. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk factors” in this annual report on Form 10-K, including “If our information technology networks \nor data, or those of third parties upon which we rely, are or were disrupted or otherwise compromised, we could experience costly \nremediation or other expenses, liability under federal and state laws, and litigation and investigations, any of which could result in \nsubstantial reputational damage and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, \nand the market price of our common stock”, for additional discussion about cybersecurity-related risks.\n \nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors holds oversight responsibility over the Company’s strategy and risk management, including material \nrisks related to cybersecurity threats. This oversight is executed directly by the Board of Directors and through its committees. The Audit \nCommittee of the Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”) oversees the management of systemic risks, including cybersecurity, in \naccordance with its charter. The Audit Committee engages in regular discussions with management regarding the Company’s significant \nfinancial risk exposures and the measures implemented to monitor and control these risks, including those that may result from material \ncybersecurity threats. These discussions include the Company’s risk assessment and risk management policies.\n \nOur management, represented by our \nChief Technology Officer, Greg C. Thomas, and our Chief Financial Officer and \nTreasurer, Marc E. Binda\n, leads our cybersecurity risk assessment and management processes and oversees their implementation and \nmaintenance.\n \n51\nGreg C. Thomas is an experienced information technology professional in our information technology department and has \nserved as Chief Technology Officer since 2018. He works with the Company’s internal information technology department and external \npartners to monitor and improve our cybersecurity capabilities. Mr. Thomas possesses a proven real estate industry track record of \nguiding organizations through strategic technology, organizational, risk mitigation, process improvement initiatives, and digital \ntransformations. He also possesses extensive experience in technology and cybersecurity, gained over his career spanning more than \n30 years, including as Chief Information Officer at two other large real estate firms, as well as in leadership roles within the real estate \nindustry technology practices of Ernst & Young LLP and Deloitte LLP. He earned Bachelor of Science degrees in Systems Analysis and \nFinance from Miami University.  \nMarc E. Binda, CPA, is an experienced risk management professional in our finance and risk management function and has \nserved as Chief Financial Officer since September 2023 and as Treasurer since April 2018. Mr. Binda previously served as Executive \nVice President – Finance and Treasurer from June 2019 to September 2023, as Senior Vice President – Finance and Treasurer from \nApril 2018 to June 2019, as Senior Vice President – Finance from April 2012 to April 2018, and in other capacities from January 2005 to \nApril 2012. Mr. Binda currently oversees key functions for the Company’s accounting, finance, and treasury strategies, including risk \nmanagement. In addition, Mr. Binda leads the Company’s cybersecurity risk oversight and the development and enhancement of \ninternal controls designed to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate the risk of cyber incidents.\nManagement, in coordination with our information technology department, is responsible for hiring appropriate personnel, \nhelping to integrate cybersecurity risk considerations into the Company’s overall risk management strategy, and communicating key \npriorities to relevant personnel.\n Management is responsible for approving budgets, approving cybersecurity processes, and reviewing \ncybersecurity assessments and other cybersecurity-related matters.    \nOur cybersecurity incident response and vulnerability management processes are designed to escalate certain cybersecurity \nincidents to members of management depending on the circumstances. \nManagement, including the Chief Technology Officer and Chief \nFinancial Officer and Treasurer, serves on the Company’s incident response team to help the Company mitigate and remediate \ncybersecurity incidents of which they are notified. In addition, the Company’s incident response processes include reporting to the Audit \nCommittee for certain cybersecurity incidents.\n The Audit Committee holds quarterly meetings and receives periodic reports from \nmanagement, including from our \nChief Technology Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n, concerning the Company’s \nsignificant cybersecurity threats and risk and the processes the Company has implemented to address them.\n52\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nGeneral\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had \n391\n properties in North America\n consisting of approximately\n \n44.1 million\n RSF of operating \nproperties and new Class A/A+ development and redevelopment properties under construction, including \n67\n properties that are held by \nconsolidated real estate joint ventures and \nfour\n properties that are held by unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. The occupancy \npercentage of our operating properties in North America was \n94.6%\n as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n. The exteriors of our properties typically \nresemble traditional office properties, but the interior infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs of life science tenants. \nThese improvements typically are generic rather than specific to a particular tenant. As a result, we believe that the improvements have \nlong-term value and utility and are usable by a wide range of tenants. Improvements to our properties typically include:\n•\nReinforced concrete floors;\n•\nUpgraded roof loading capacity;\n•\nIncreased floor-to-ceiling heights;\n•\nHeavy-duty HVAC systems;\n•\nEnhanced environmental control technology;\n•\nSignificantly upgraded electrical, gas, and plumbing infrastructure; and\n•\nLaboratory benches.\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we held a fee simple interest in each of our properties, with the exception of \n32\n properties in North \nAmerica subject to ground leasehold interests, which accounted for approximately\n \n8%\n of our total number of properties. \nOf these \n32\n \nproperties, we held \neight\n properties in the Greater Boston market, \n20\n properties in the San Francisco Bay Area market, \none\n property in \nthe Seattle market, \none\n property in the Maryland market, and \ntwo\n properties in the New York City market.\n During the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, as a percentage of net operating income our ground lease rental expense aggregated \n1.6%\n. Refer to our \nconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “\nItem 15. Exhibits and financial statement schedules\n” in this annual report on \nForm 10-K for further discussion.\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had over \n1,000\n le\nases with a total of approximately\n \n800\n tena\nnts, and \n171\n,\n or \n44%\n, of our \n391\n \nproperties were single-tenant properties. Leases in our multi-tenant buildings typically have initial terms o\nf \n3\n to \n9\n year\ns, while leases in \nour single-tenant buildings typically have initial terms o\nf \n5\n to \n15\n ye\nars. Additionally, as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n:\n•\nInvestment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represented \n52%\n of our total annual rental revenue;\n•\nApproximately \n97%\n of our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) contained effective annual rent escalations \napproximating\n \n3%\n th\nat were either fixed or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index;\n•\nApproximatel\ny \n92%\n of\n our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay \nsubstantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other \noperating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent;\n•\nApproximately \n92%\n \nof our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) provided for the recapture of capital expenditures \n(such as HVAC maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement, and parking lot resurfacing) that we believe would \ntypically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases; and\n•\n84%\n of our leasing activity during the last twelve months was generated from our existing tenant base.\nOur leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed \nimprovements to the properties are reusable generic improvements and remain our property after termination of the lease at our \nelection. However, we are permitted under the terms of most of our leases to require that the tenant, at its expense, remove certain \nnon-generic improvements and restore the premises to their original condition.\nRefer to “\nAnnual rental revenue\n” and “\nOperating statistics\n” under “\nDefinitions and reconciliations\n” in Item 7 in this annual report \non Form 10-K for a description of the basis used to compute the aforementioned measures. \n53\nLocations of properties\nOur properties are strategically located in AAA life science innovation cluster markets.

These projects are focused on providing high-quality, \ngeneric, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of a wide range of tenants. Upon completion, each development or \nredevelopment project is expected to generate increases in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development and \nredevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher \noccupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value. Our pre-construction \nactivities are undertaken in order to prepare the property for its intended use and include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and \nother activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. \nOur investments in real estate consisted of the following as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n (dollars in thousands):\nDevelopment and

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn 2006, ARE-East River Science Park, LLC, a subsidiary of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., was granted an option to \nincorporate a land parcel adjacent to and north of the Alexandria Center\n®\n for Life Science – New York City (“ACLS-NYC”) campus \n(“Option Parcel”) into the existing ground lease of that campus.\n The Option Parcel will allow ARE-East River Science Park, LLC to \ndevelop a future world-class life science building within the ACLS-NYC campus. ARE-East River Science Park, LLC’s investment in pre-\nconstruction costs related to the development of the Option Parcel, including costs related to design, engineering, environmental, \nsurvey/title, and permitting and legal costs, aggrega\nted\n \n$168.4 million\n \nas of December 31, 2024\n.\nOn August 6, 2024, ARE-East River Science Park, LLC filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York \nagainst its landlord, New York City Health + Hospitals Corporation (“H+H”), and the New York City Economic Development Corporation \n(“EDC”).\n On January 24, 2025, ARE-East River Science Park, LLC filed a First Amended Complaint. \nT\nhe lawsuit alleges two principal \nclaims against H+H and EDC: fraud in the inducement, and, in the alternative, breach of contract in violation of the implied covenant of \ngood faith and fair dealing. As alleged in the complaint, ARE-East River Science Park, LLC’s claims arise from H+H’s and EDC’s \nmisrepresentations and concealment of material facts in connection with a floodwall, which H+H and EDC are seeking to require ARE-\nEast River Science Park, LLC to integrate into the development of the Option Parcel. ARE-East River Science Park, LLC alleges that \nH+H’s and EDC’s misconduct have prevented it from commencing the development of the Option Parcel. In light of the pending \nlitigation, the closing date for our option and thus the commencement date for construction of the third tower at the campus are \npresently indeterminate. Among other things, ARE-East River Science Park, LLC is seeking significant damages and equitable relief \nfrom the court to confirm our understanding that the option is in full force and effect.\nThis matter exposes us to potential losses ranging from zero to the full amount of the investment in the project aggregating \n$168.4 million\n \nas of December 31, 2024\n, depending on any collection of damages and/or the ability to develop the project. We \nperformed a probability-weighted recoverability analysis based on initial estimates of various possible outcomes and determined no \nimpairment was present \nas of December 31, 2024\n.\nITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES \nOF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “ARE.” On \nJanuary 15, 2025\n, the last reported sales price per \nshare of our common stock was \n$98.43\n, and there were \n562\n \nholders of record of our common stock (excluding beneficial owners whose \nshares are held in the name of Cede & Co.). \nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable \nincome for the current taxable year, determined without regard to deductions for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains. \nUnder certain circumstances, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash flows available for distribution to meet these \ndistribution requirements. In such a case, we may borrow funds or may raise funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity \ncapital. No dividends can be paid on our common stock unless we have paid full cumulative dividends on our preferred stock. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had no outstanding shares of preferred stock. Future distributions on our common stock will be determined by, \nand made at the discretion of, our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including actual cash available for \ndistribution to our stockholders, our financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT \nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code, restrictions under Maryland law, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems \nrelevant. We cannot assure our stockholders that we will make any future distributions.\nRefer to “\nItem 12.

Refer to the initial and stabilized occupancy years under “New Class A/A+ development and \nredevelopment properties: current projects” in Item 2 for additional information.\n88\nTrends that may affect our future results\nIn \n2024\n, we identified key market trends and uncertainties that had or may have a negative effect on our business. Although \nwe have mitigating strategies to minimize the risks posed by these trends and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that these \nmeasures will be successful in preventing material impacts on our future results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Refer \nto “Item 1A. Risk factors” in this annual report on Form 10-K for discussion of additional risks we face.  \n•\nNew competitive supply may exert pressure on our rental rates and adversely affect our operating results.\n \nDuring and \nafter the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift toward hybrid and remote work arrangements has led certain office and other real \nestate companies to repurpose their underutilized office spaces into laboratory facilities. Our success and the success of other \nlaboratory operators have prompted and may continue to prompt new and existing life science developers to commence \nspeculative redevelopment and/or development projects in anticipation of demand for laboratory facilities. These conversion \nand speculative development projects contributed to a significant influx of new laboratory properties in key markets such as \nBoston, San Diego, and San Francisco, heightening competitive pressures and diluting pricing power in certain submarkets.\nThe increase in the supply of laboratory properties may persist in the near future, potentially intensifying competition and \ncontinuing to exert downward pressure on rental and occupancy rates. Our rental rates for renewed/re-leased space increased \nby\n \n16.9%\n, \n29.4%\n, and \n31.0%\n \nduring \nyears ended December 31, 2024\n, \n2023\n, and \n2022\n, respectively, and we expect an \nincrease of \n9.0%\n to \n17.0%\n in \n2025\n. However, to remain competitive, retain existing tenants, or attract new tenants, we may \nneed to reduce our future rental rates below these projections and/or offer more tenant improvement allowances or additional \ntenant concessions, including free rent. The table below reflects a trend of increasing tenant improvement and leasing \ncommissions per RSF and free rent related to our renewed/re-leased space:\nTenant Improvements/\nLeasing Commissions per RSF\nAverage Free Rent \nper Annum\n2022\n$\n27.83\n0.3 months\n2023\n$\n26.09\n0.6 months\n2024\n$\n46.89\n0.7 months\nAs of December 31, \n2024\n, we anticipate that \n4.4 million\n RSF\n of projects undergoing construction\n,\n \nwhi\nch are expected to be \nplaced into service from \n2025\n through the \nsecond quarter of 2028\n,\n and \nwill generate \n$395 million\n in future incremental annual \nnet operating income\n.\n These RSF are \n45%\n leased or under lease negotiations as of December 31, \n2024\n. The realization of the \naforementioned risks could hinder our ability to secure tenants for the remaining unleased RSF related to these projects at the \nexpected rates, or at all, potentially leading to a shortfall in or delays in the commencement of the projected incremental \nannual net operating income.\n•\nUnfavorable capital markets and overall macroeconomic environment negatively impacting the value of our real \nestate and non-real estate portfolios may limit our ability to raise capital to further our business objectives.\n \nThe effective execution of our development and redevelopment activities is contingent upon our access to the required capital.\n \nIn \n2025\n, we expect to incur from \n$1.5 billion\n to \n$2.1 billion\n in construction spending.\n•\nLower property valuations and increased capitalization rates\n.\n A portion of our projected construction and acquisition \nspending is expected to be funded through dispositions and sales of partial interests in core and non-core real estate \nassets. Real estate investments are generally less liquid than many other investment types, which can present challenges \nin selling our properties timely or at desirable prices, particularly in an economic climate marked by ongoing uncertainties \naround inflation and interest rates, in addition to those related to oversupply.\nAlthough the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target range during\n \n2024\n to\n \n4.25%\n–\n4.50%\n from \n5.25%\n–\n5.50%\n at the end of \n2023\n, interest rates remain elevated. This\n could continue to limit access to debt and/or equity \nfinancing for the prospective buyers of our real estate assets, potentially eliminating their participation in the market or \nforcing them to seek more expensive alternative funding options. Such challenges for buyers could lead to a rise in \nproperties available for sale, and could exert downward pressure on property valuations and elevate capitalization rates, \npotentially adversely impacting the sales proceeds we expect from our real estate asset sales in \n2025\n.\nThe new supply, discussed above, combined with high interest rates and reduced market liquidity, may result in a \nprolonged period of lower property valuations and higher capitalization rates, potentially leading to significant additional \nreal estate impairments. In 2024, these market conditions made it challenging to execute asset sales at anticipated \nvaluations within expected timelines. For more information about our sales of real estate, refer to “\nSales of real estate \nassets and impairment charges\n” in Note 3 – “Investments in real estate” to our consolidated financial statements in Item \n15 in this annual report on Form 10-K. In 2025, we expect to complete dispositions and sales of partial interests from \n$1.2 \nbillion\n to \n$2.2 billion\n. However, we may not be able to achieve this and/or other targets disclosed in our 2025 guidance as \na result of the uncertainties discussed in this section as well as in “Item 1A. Risk factors” in this annual report on Form 10-\nK. \n89\nThe table below presents total dispositions, gain on sales of real estate, consideration in excess of book value, real estate \nimpairment, and a trend of increasing capitalization rates associated with dispositions and sales of partial interests in our \nreal estate assets in \n2022\n, \n2023\n, and \n2024\n (dollars in thousands). While the increase in capitalization rates presented in \nthe table can partly be attributed to the quality of core and non-core assets we sold during each period, capitalization rates \nin general have increased in recent years, and there is no assurance that this upward trend will stabilize or reverse in the \nfuture. \nTotal Dispositions \nand Sales of \nPartial Interests\nGains on \nSales of Real \nEstate\nConsideration \nin Excess of \nBook Value\nReal Estate \nImpairment\nCapitalization \nRates\n(1)\nCapitalization \nRates \n(cash basis)\n(1)\n2022\n$\n2,222,296\n$\n537,918\n$\n644,029\n$\n64,969\n4.5%\n4.4%\n2023\n$\n1,314,414\n$\n277,037\n$\n7,792\n$\n461,114\n6.7%\n5.9%\n2024\n$\n1,382,453\n$\n129,312\n$\n—\n$\n223,068\n7.7%\n6.5%\n(1)\nCapitalization rates are calculated only for stabilized operating assets sold. Refer to “Capitalization rates” under “\nDefinitions and reconciliations\n” in Item \n7 for additional information.\n•\nIncreased cost and limited availability of capital.\n \nIn \n2025\n, we expect to issue approximately \n$600 million\n of unsecured \nbonds, primarily to refinance our $600 million bonds maturing in April 2025. However, should we encounter difficulties in \nselling our real estate assets at our targeted prices, we may need to increase our reliance on debt financing to fund our \nconstruction projects, which are projected to aggregate approximately \n$1.8 billion\n based on the midpoint of our \n2025\n \nguidance. \nIn addition, our uses of capital include ground lease prepayments aggregating \n$270.0 million\n. In July 2024, we executed \nan amendment to our existing ground lease agreement at the Alexandria Technology Square\n®\n Megacampus in our \nCambridge submarket to extend the term of the ground lease b\ny \n24 years\n to 2088\n. The amendment requires that we \nprepay our entire rent obligation for the extended lease term aggregating \n$270.0 million\n in two equal installments\n. \nDuring \nthe three months ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we made the first installment payment of \n$135.0 million\n, followed by the \nsecond installment payment of \n$135.0 million\n on \nJanuary 14, 2025\n.\n \nWe believe the lease extension significantly enhances \nthe long-term value of our investment in this critical Megacampus. However, the rent prepayment under this ground lease \nalso significantly impacted earnings due to the elevated cost of capital. \nIf the current high interest rate environment persists or worsens, the debt funding option could become costlier, less \naccessible, or even unavailable, potentially limiting our ability to complete our development projects on schedule and \nthereby delaying our expected incremental annual net operating income generation and negatively affecting our business.\nThe table below reflects a trend of increasing interest rates related to our unsecured senior notes payable issued in \n2022\n, \n2023\n, and \n2024\n (dollars in thousands). There is no assurance that this trend of increasing debt costs will not continue into \nthe future. \nUnsecured Senior \nNotes Payable Issued\nInterest Rate\n(1)\n2022\n$\n1,800,000\n3.38%\n2023\n$\n1,000,000\n5.07%\n2024\n$\n1,000,000\n5.57%\n(1)\nIncludes amortization of loan fees, amortization of debt premiums (discounts), and other bank fees.\n•\nCapitalized interest.\n In \n2025\n, our capitalized interest is expected to range from \n$340 million\n to \n$370 million\n and interest \nexpense from \n$165 million\n to \n$195 million\n. Our strategic focus is on prioritizing the completion of our highly leased \nprojects under construction. Additionally, we invest in our future pipeline with the goals of enhancing value and reducing \nthe timeline to allow for vertical construction. This is in response to our expectation of increased future demand for these \nprojects and is reflected in our expectation for capitalized interest. Refer to “\nCapitalized interest\n” under “\nDefinitions and \nreconciliations\n” in Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information. \nHowever, the challenging macroeconomic environment, including the elevated supply of laboratory space, higher costs or \nunavailability of debt, and challenges in obtaining sufficient proceeds from real estate asset dispositions, as discussed \nabove, have necessitated and may continue to necessitate a reevaluation of our current plans and lead to a temporary \nsuspension of our construction projects. This could result in a decline in our \n2025\n capitalized interest below our current \nprojections and in a further increase in interest expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in \n2025\n.\n90\nThe table below presents gross interest expense, capitalized interest, and interest expense during \n2022\n, \n2023\n, and \n2024\n \n(in thousands). \nGross Interest Expense\nCapitalized Interest\nInterest Expense\n2022\n$\n372,848\n$\n(278,645)\n$\n94,203\n2023\n$\n438,182\n$\n(363,978)\n$\n74,204\n2024\n$\n516,799\n$\n(330,961)\n$\n185,838\n•\nVolatility in non-real estate investments\n.\n We hold strategic investments in publicly traded companies and privately held \nentities primarily involved\n in the life science industry.\n These investments are subject to market and sector-specific risks \nthat can substantially affect their valuation. Like many other industries, the life science industry is susceptible to \nmacroeconomic challenges, such as ongoing economic uncertainty and a tighter capital environment. These factors may \nlead to increased volatility in the valuation of our non-real estate investments. \nIn such a challenging environment, distributions from our investments — which we may receive as dividends, as \nliquidation distributions from our investments in limited partnerships, or as a result of mergers and acquisitions that lead to \nour privately held investees being acquired by other entities — could result in lower realized gains. Moreover, should \nmarket conditions worsen, we may face challenges in selling these securities at optimal prices, potentially disrupting our \ncapital strategy. \nUnfavorable market conditions could also indicate potential impairment of our investments in privately held entities that do \nnot report NAV per share and lead to the recognition of additional significant non-real estate impairments, lower realized \ngains, and higher unrealized losses. \nThe table below reflects the volatility of our non-real estate investments in \n2022\n, \n2023\n, and \n2024\n (in thousands):\nRealized Gains\n(1)\nUnrealized Losses\nTotal Investment Loss\n2022\n$\n80,435\n$\n(412,193)\n$\n(331,758)\n2023\n$\n6,078\n$\n(201,475)\n$\n(195,397)\n2024\n$\n59,124\n$\n(112,246)\n$\n(53,122)\n(1)\nI\nncludes impairment charges aggregating \n$58.1 million\n, \n$74.6 million\n, and \n$20.5 million\n f\nor the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n2023\n, and \n2022\n, \nrespectively.\nThe realization of any of the aforementioned risks could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, particularly our \nincome from rentals, net operating income, our results of operations, funds from operations, operating margins, initial \nstabilized yields (unlevered) on new or existing construction projects, occupancy, EPS, FFO per share, our overall \nbusiness, and the market value of our common stock. \n•\nMitigating factors:\n•\nMegacampus strategy: focus on premier Class A/A+ assets in AAA life science innovation cluster locations.\n \nAlexandria has established a high-quality Labspace\n®\n asset base predominantly concentrated in markets with high barriers \nto entry. Despite a recent increase in the availability of laboratory space, Alexandria is expected to continue to benefit from \nour focus on Class A/A+ assets strategically clustered in Megacampus ecosystems in AAA life science innovation cluster \nlocations in close proximity to top academic and medical research institutions. This proximity is a key driver of tenant \ndemand. Our Megacampus ecosystems are used in two distinct ways: (i) to house the research operations of our tenants \nand (ii) to recruit and retain the best talent available from a limited pool, which underscores why the scale, strategic \ndesign, and placement our Megacampus ecosystems provide are critical. \nCEOs of life science companies typically anticipate rapid and exponential growth upon their companies’ achieving  \nscientific milestones. Our Megacampus ecosystems are designed for scalability, providing opportunities for our tenants to \ngrow within our Megacampus ecosystems, including through our \nfuture developments and redevelopments aggregating \n29.5 million\n RSF\n,\n of which\n \n68%\n is concentrated within our Megacampus ecosystem\ns. The strategic location of our \nMegacampus ecosystems, which offer both high visibility and a clear path to growth, serves as a powerful motivator for \ntenants to lease space from us. \n91\nMoreover, our tenants recognize that their success is directly linked to their ability to attract and retain personnel to \nadvance their science. Our Megacampus ecosystems provide a superior set of amenities, services, and access to transit \nthat offer our tenants valuable optionality. The collaborative, vibrant elements of our Megacampus ecosystems, coupled \nwith world-class amenities, enhance their confidence in using these spaces as effective recruiting tools. In contrast, a \nsignificant amount of the competitive supply in the market today consists of isolated, one-off buildings. These facilities may \nprovide operational space, but they fall short in offering the scale and strategic design that our Megacampus ecosystems \ndeliver.  \nConsequently, our external growth strategy focuses on the development of new Megacampus ecosystems and the \nenhancement of existing ones, serving as our most effective defense against competitive supply. Over the past three \ndecades, we have established a significant market presence in AAA innovation cluster locations. Our Megacampus \nfacilities provide a comprehensive solution to life science tenants, one that is challenging to replicate due to the significant \ntime and capital required to replicate this model. We believe the focus on our Megacampus strategy will continue to \nposition us favorably compared to potential supply of new competitive laboratory spaces. This strategy is partially \nresponsible for our \n2024\n performance metrics listed below, which have been achieved despite the current challenging \nmacroeconomic environment:\n•\nOur Megacampus properties account for \n77%\n \nof our total annual rental revenue as of December 31, \n2024\n. \n•\nStrong funds from operations per share – diluted, as adjusted, for \n2024\n of \n$9.47\n.\n•\nS\name property net operating income growth of \n1.2%\n and \n4.6%\n (cash basis) for the year ended December 31, \n2024\n.\n•\nSolid occupancy o\nf \n94.6%\n as of December 31, \n2024\n.\n•\nSolid rental rate increases of \n16.9%\n and \n7.2%\n (c\nash basis) for the year ended December 31, \n2024\n.\n•\nStrong leasing volume aggregating \n5.1 million\n RSF for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n, up \n17%\n compared to our \n2023 leasing volume. \n•\nThe weighted-average lease term for leases executed during \n2024\n was\n \n8.9\n \nyears; and\n•\nOur projects expected to stabilize in 2025 are \n89%\n leased/negotiating\n. \n•\nOperational excellence of our team.\n Alexandria provides and demonstrates operational excellence in direct asset \nmanagement and operations of our Labspace\n®\n asset base. This high level of performance is crucial in helping to protect \nbillions of dollars’ worth of intensive infrastructure, specialized equipment, and invaluable tenant research and clinical \nassets. The demanding nature of laboratory-based scientific research requires strict adherence to safety standards set by \nlocal, state, and federal regulatory bodies. Key compliance aspects include good manufacturing practice and Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) certifications, adherence to national biosafety level guidelines, proper \npermitting and handling of hazardous waste generation and chemical storage, maintenance of safety stations, effective \nmanagement of ultra-low temperature freezers, and careful licensing and management of radioactive materials. \nOur team is composed of highly experienced, educated, and professionally credentialed facilities specialists. This \nexpertise is essential in ensuring a secure and efficient environment for groundbreaking scientific research and has been \ncultivated and maintained over many years. \n•\nStrength of our brand.\n \nAs a recognized leader in the life science and real estate sectors, Alexandria has successfully \nbuilt a diverse and high-quality tenant base. Over the past three decades, we have fostered longstanding relationships \nand strategic partnerships with our tenants, which have enabled us to maintain strong occupancy, leasing, and growth in \nnet operating income and cash flows and to effectively navigate through various economic cycles. Key indicators of our \nbrand strength include:\n•\nAs of December 31, 2024\n,\n \n84%\n of our leasing activity during the last twelve months was generated from our existing \ntenant base.\n•\nAs of December 31, 2024\n,\n \n92%\n of our top 20 tenants annual rental revenue is derived from investment-grade or \nlarge-cap publicly traded companies.\n•\nSolid occupancy of \n94.6%\n as of December 31, \n2024\n; and\n•\nOur tenant collections have remained consistently high over the last four years, averaging \n99.8%\n since the beginning \nof 2021 through December 31, \n2024\n.\n•\nLife science fundamentals.\n We monitor market demand trends, particularly in the life science industry, to optimally align \nour property offerings with tenant requirements. The life science industry has shown strong long-term growth, fueled by \nmultifaceted sources of funding, including private venture capital, biopharma R&D spend, government funding, and \nphilanthropic support for biomedical innovation. Our focus on high-quality Labspace\n®\n assets in prime locations positions \nus to effectively capitalize on these ongoing trends:\n•\nThe R&D expenditures by U.S. publicly traded life science companies have shown consistent growth since 2014, \nnearly doubling in 2023 compared to 2014. \nAs of December 31, 2024\n, \n17\n of the top 20 pharma R&D spenders (for the \nyear 2023) are Alexandria tenants.\n•\nThe sector’s growth is further supported by substantial \nfunding life science companies by private-venture capital, \nwhich totaled over $40B in 2024, over 2.5x the capital deployed in 2014. \n•\nFDA approvals of novel medicines continue to accelerate. Novel approvals by the\n FDA’s CDER division averaged 49 \nfrom 2020–2024, over double the average from 2005–2009.\n92\n•\nPrudent financial management.\n Our strong and flexible balance sheet and prudent balance sheet management are key \nfactors in our ability to navigate economic uncertainties and capitalize on new opportunities. The strength of our financial \nposition is highlighted by several key indicators:\n•\nOur significant liquidity o\nf \n$5.7 billion\n \nas of December 31, 2024\n provides us the flexibility to address our operational \nneeds and to pursue growth opportunities.\n•\nWe expect to have the ability to self-fund a large portion of our capital requirements through the following sources in \n2025\n:\n•\n$475 million\n in net cash provided by operating activities after dividends, at the midpoint of our guidance range for \n2025\n.\n•\n$684.1 million\n in capital contributions to fund construction expected from our existing consolidated real estate \njoint venture partners from January 1, \n2025\n through \n2028\n.\n•\n$1.7 billion\n from dispositions and sales of partial interests in real estate assets at the midpoint of our guidance \nrange for \n2025\n. \n•\nAs of December 31, \n2024\n, our credit ratings from Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings were \nBaa1\n and\n \nBBB+\n, \nrespectively, which continued to rank i\nn the \ntop 10%\n among all publicly traded U.S. REITs.\n•\nAs of December 31, \n2024\n, our\n fixed-rate debt represents \n98.8%\n of our total deb\nt, which provides predictability in debt \nservicing costs. Our fixed rate debt percentage has\n averaged \n98.4%\n of total debt as of December 31 of each year \nsince 2020.\n•\nOur debt maturity schedule is well laddered which provides us with financial flexibility and reduces short-term \nrefinancing risks. As of December 31, \n2024\n, \n32%\n of our debt matures in 2049 or later and only \n14%\n of our debt \nmatures in the next three years.\n•\nAs of December 31, \n2024\n, the \nweighted-average remaining term of our debt is \n12.7\n years\n, demonstrating our \nstrategic approach to debt management and focus on maintaining manageable annual debt maturities.\n•\nOur \nnet debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was \n5.2x\n for the three months ended December 31, \n2024\n \nannualized.\n•\nOther mitigating factors\n•\nImprovement in office market.\n The increase in demand for premium office space in 2024, primarily driven by the tech \nsector, particularly companies focused on AI, absorbed some of the market’s previously misguided office-to-lab \nconversions, which are now being repurposed back into modern office environments. High ceilings, improved \nventilation systems, and abundant natural light have become highly desirable features, appealing to office tenants. \nThis trend is expected to lead to the exit from the life science sector of inexperienced life science real estate \ndevelopers and expedite the resolution of the oversupply.\n•\nProjected decrease in general and administrative expenses.\n Over the past few years, we have implemented \ncomprehensive measures to reduce our expenditures across our organization, including our general and \nadministrative expenses, which provided savings during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year \nended December 31, 2023, and are expected to provide significant savings in 2025 and beyond. With these \ninitiatives, we anticipate a reduction in general and administrative expenses of approximately\n \n$32 million\n, or \n23%\n,\n \nduring the year ending December 31, 2025, based on the midpoint of our 2025 guidance, compared to the year \nended December 31, \n2024\n. These projected savings are expected to stem from a variety of implemented cost-control \nand efficiency initiatives including, but not limited to, the following:\n(i)\nPersonnel-related matters, including:\n•\nReduction in headcount over the last two years.\n•\nRestructuring of various compensation plans.\n(ii)\nStreamlining of business processes:\n•\nImplementation of systems upgrades, process improvements, and smarter technology.\n•\nRenegotiation of contracts related to legal, technology, and operational support services, and \nelimination of redundancies through better alignment and consolidation of roles. \nThese and other changes are projected to generate annual savings of approximately\n \n$32 million\n, or \n23%\n,\n during the \nyear ending December 31, 2025, based on the midpoint of our 2025 guidance, compared to the year ended \nDecember 31, \n2024\n, with a significant portion of these savings anticipated to potentially continue beyond 2025. As a \npercentage of net operating income, our general and administrative expenses for the trailing twelve months ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n wer\ne \n7.6%\n and \n9.8%\n, respectively\n. \n93\nExecution of capital strategy\n2024\n capital strategy\nDuring \n2024\n, we continued to execute many of the long-term components of our capital strategy, as described below. \nMaintained access to diverse sources of capital strategically important to our long-term capital structure \n•\nGenerated significant net cash flows from operating activities.\n•\nIn \n2024\n, we funded \n$497.8 million\n of our equity capital needs with net cash flows from operating activities after dividends \nand distributions to the company's consolidated real estate joint venture partners, and excluding the impact of changes in \nworking capital.\n•\nSuccessfully executed our \n2024\n capital strategy, driven primarily by strategic dispositions that focused on a portfolio of \ndiversified assets.\n•\nIn \n2024\n, dispositions from real estate\n generated \n$1.4 billion\n of capital for investment into our development and \nredevelopment projects.\n•\nIn February 2024, we entered into a new ATM common stock offering program that allows us to sell up to an aggregate of \n$1.5 billion\n of our common stock. \n•\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, we entered into new forward equity sales agreements aggregating \n$28 million\n to sell \n230 thousand\n share\ns of common stock under our ATM program at an average price per share of \n$122.32\n (before underwriting discounts).\n \n•\nDuring the \nthree months ended December 31, 2024\n, we settled all outstanding forward equity sales agreements by \nissuing \n230 thousand\n shares\n of common stock at an average price per share of \n$120.93\n and received net proceeds \nof \n$27.8 million\n, before offering costs.\n•\nAs of the date of this report, the remaining aggregate amount available for future sales of common stock under our ATM \nprogram was \n$1.47 billion\n.\n•\nAch\nieved significant \ngrowth in annualized Adjusted EBITDA of \n$178.5 million\n, or \n9%\n,\n for the \nthree months ended December \n31, 2024\n, compared to the \nthree months ended December 31, 2023\n, which allowed us to:\n•\nOpportunistically issue, on a leverage-neutral basis, \nunsecured senior notes payable aggregating \n$1.0 billion\n with a \nweighted-average interest rate of \n5.48%\n and a \nweighted-average maturity of \n23.1 years\n; and\n•\nMaintain ou\nr net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA ratio to \n5.2x\n for the \nthree months ended December 31, \n2024\n, annualized.\nStrong and flexible balance sheet with significant liquidity, \ntop 10%\n credit rating ranking among all publicly traded U.S. REITs\n \n•\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, our credit ratings from \nMoody’s Ratings and \nS&P Global Ratings\n were \nBaa1\n and \nBBB+\n, \nrespectively, which continued to rank i\nn the \ntop 10%\n among all publicly traded U.S. REITs.\n•\nNet debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA of \n5.2x\n \nand fi\nxed-charge coverage ratio of \n4.3x\n for the \nthree months ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, annualized. \n•\nSignificant liquidity of \n$5.7 billion\n.\n•\n32%\n of our total debt matures in 2049 and beyond.\n•\n12.7\n years weighted-average remaining term of debt\n.\n•\nSince \n2020\n, an average of \n98.4%\n \nof our year-end debt balances have been fixed rate\n.\n•\nTotal debt and preferred stock to gross assets of \n28%\n.\n•\n$684.1 million\n \nof expected capital contribution commitments from existing consolidated real estate joint venture partners to \nfund construction from \nJanuary 1, 2025\n through \n2028\n.\nKey capital metrics as of or for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n•\n$29.0 billion\n in total market capitalization.\n•\n$16.8 billion\n in total equity capitalization.\n•\nNon-real estate investments aggregating \n$1.5 billion\n:\n•\nUnrealized \ngains\n presented in our consolidated balance sheet were \n$83.6 million\n, comprising gross unrealized gains and \nlosses aggregating \n$228.1 million\n and \n$144.5 million\n, respectively.\n•\nI\nnvestment \nloss\n of \n$53.1 million\n for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n presented in our consolidated statement of operations \nconsisted o\nf \n$117.2 million\n of realized \ngains\n, \n$112.2 million\n of unrealized \nlosses\n,\n and \n$58.1 million\n of impairment charges.\n94\n2025\n capital strategy\nDuring \n2025\n, we intend to continue to execute our capital strategy to further strengthen our credit profile, which will allow us to \nfurther improve our cost of capital and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Consistent with \n2024\n, our capital strategy \nfor \n2025\n includes the following elements:\n•\nAllocate capital to Class A/A+ properties located in Megacampus ecosystems in AAA life science innovation clusters.\n•\nMaintain prudent access to diverse sources of capital, which include net cash flows from operating activities after dividends, \nincremental leverage-neutral debt supported by growth in Adjusted EBITDA, strategic value harvesting and asset recycling \nthrough real estate disposition and partial interest sales, non-real estate investment sales, sales of equity, joint venture capital, \nand other sources of capital.\n•\nContinue to improve our credit profile.\n•\nMaintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth.\n•\nPrudently ladder debt maturities and manage short-term variable-rate debt.\n•\nPrudently manage non-real estate equity investments to support corporate-level investment strategies.\n•\nMaintain a stable and flexible balance sheet with significant liquidity.\n•\nConsider opportunistic repurchases, in privately negotiated transactions, of our common stock.\nThe anticipated delivery of significant incremental EBITDA from our development and redevelopment of new Class A/A+ \nproperties is expected to enable us to continue to debt-fund a significant portion of our development and redevelopment projects on a \nleverage-neutral basis. We expect to continue to maintain access to diverse sources of capital, including unsecured senior notes \npayable and secured construction loans for our development and redevelopment projects from time to time. We expect to continue to \nmaintain a significant proportion of our net operating income on an unencumbered basis to allow for future flexibility for accessing both \nunsecured and secured debt markets, although we expect traditional secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small component of \nour capital structure. We intend to supplement our remaining capital needs with net cash flows from operating activities after dividends \nand proceeds from real estate asset sales, partial interest sales, and equity capital. For further information, refer to “Projected results, \nSources of capital,” and “Uses of capital” in Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our ability to meet our \n2025\n capital strategy \nobjectives and expectations will depend in part on capital market conditions, real estate market conditions, and other factors beyond our \ncontrol. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these objectives and expectations. Refer to our \ndiscussion of “\nForward-looking statements\n” under Part I and “Item 1A.

However, the physical effects of climate change may \npotentially have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, and business. For example, most of our properties are located \nalong the east and west coasts of the U.S. and some of our properties are located in close proximity to shorelines. To the extent that \nclimate change impacts weather patterns, our markets could experience severe weather, including hurricanes, severe winter storms, \nwildfires, droughts, and coastal flooding due to increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. Over time, these conditions could \nresult in declining demand for space at our properties, delays in construction and resulting increased construction costs, or our inability \nto operate the buildings at all. Climate change and severe weather may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the \ncost of, or decreasing the availability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable, and by increasing the costs of energy, \nmaintenance, repair of water and/or wind damage, and snow removal at our properties. We continue to evaluate our asset base for \npotential exposure to the following climate-related risks: sea level rise and increases in heavy rain, flood, drought, extreme heat, and \nwildfire.\nWe are monitoring considerations such as shifting market demands and regulation. Numerous states and municipalities have \nadopted state and local laws and policies on climate change, including climate disclosures and emission reduction targets impacting the \nbuilding sector. For example, the State of California enacted legislation requiring certain companies to disclose GHG and climate-\nrelated financial risk information. Further cities including Boston, Cambridge, New York, and Seattle have passed ordinances that set \nlimits on GHG emissions associated with building operations. Some municipalities, including the Cities of New York and San Francisco, \nhave also implemented legislation to eliminate the use of natural gas in new construction projects. Refer to “\nWe face possible risks and \ncosts associated with the effects of climate change and severe weather\n” in “\nOther factors\n” within “\nItem 1A. Risk factors\n” in this annual \nreport on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOur approach to assessing and mitigating physical climate-related risk through our climate resilience roadmap, and transition \nrisk through our GHG emissions mitigation strategy, are outlined below.\nClimate resilience roadmap\nWe continue to assess potential physical risks associated with climate change, analyze climate data and property damage \nlosses associated with past weather events, and review the potential for future climate hazards such as water stress, precipitation \nflooding, coastal flooding, wildfire, and heat stress. We also consider local climate change vulnerability assessments and resilience \nplanning efforts. Our climate resilience roadmap uses climate models and scenario analyses to identify potential future hazards at the \nbuilding level. Additionally, we conduct physical inspections to further assess resilience at certain properties, as appropriate, and to \ndetermine whether additional mitigation is needed.\nIn our evaluation of physical risks, Alexandria considers two climate change scenarios for 2030 and 2050: (i) a high-emissions \nscenario in which GHG emissions continue to increase with time (RCP \n8.5\n); and (ii) an intermediate scenario in which GHG emissions \nlevel off by 2050 and decline thereafter (RCP \n4.5\n). RCP \n8.5\n generally predicts more significant future climate hazard impacts than RCP \n4.5\n.\nAfter modeling the potential hazards out to year 2050, we undertake a physical inspection for sites that may have high \nexposure to one or more climate hazards. We use this process to assess resilience to current and/or future stresses and to determine \nwhether additional mitigation is needed.\nFor a number of buildings, we are implementing augmented emergency preparedness plans and additional operating \nprocedures that include preparations for potential future events. For certain buildings, mitigation may include nominal capital \nimprovement work. We may find that other buildings require more significant planning and investment to incorporate more complex \nresilience measures. Resilience measures under consideration at some of our properties are described below.\nIn our operating properties located in areas prone to flooding, we may consider options such as waterproofing the building \nenvelope up to the projected flood elevation, protecting critical building mechanical equipment, storing temporary flood barriers on site \nto be deployed at building entrances prior to a flood event, and installing backflow preventers on stormwater/sewer utilities that \ndischarge from the building. At several properties, we are currently conducting conceptual studies to evaluate potential options for \nconsideration.\nAt a limited number of our operating properties located in areas prone to wildfire, we have begun a multiyear effort\nto implement landscaping improvements that include the replacement of fire-prone materials and the installation of fire-resistant \nvegetation.\nFor our development of new Class A/A+ properties, we will aim to design for climate resilience. In 2023, Alexandria \nimplemented resilient design guidelines to mitigate potential exposures to future climate conditions identified in existing climate models. \nIn accordance with such guidelines, we will endeavor to design buildings that incorporate materials, systems, and features to\n100\nmanage predicted climate hazards and maintain building operability during and after a climate event. As feasible, we will consider \ndesigns that accommodate potential expansion of cooling infrastructure to meet future building needs. In water-scarce areas, we will \nconsider planting drought-resistant vegetation and equipping buildings to capture, treat, and reuse available water from building\nsystems and precipitation events where feasible. In areas prone to wildfire, we will consider incorporating brush management practices \ninto landscape design and installing enhanced air filtration systems to support safe and healthy indoor air.\nFor acquisitions in our portfolio, we continue to use climate modeling as part of our due diligence in assessing potential risk \nand to inform our financial modeling and transactional decisions. \nAs a part of Alexandria’s risk management program, we maintain all-risk property insurance at the portfolio level, including \nproperties under development, to help mitigate the risk of extreme weather events and potential impact from losses associated with \nnatural catastrophes, such as flood, wildfire, and wind events. We leverage our climate mitigation strategy with property insurance \ncarriers to help reduce our overall cost of risk. However, there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all our potential losses \nand that climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business. For \nadditional information on our risk management strategies related to insurance coverage, refer to “\nOur insurance may not adequately \ncover all potential losses\n” in “\nOperating factors\n” in “\nItem 1A. Risk factors\n” in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nGreenhouse gas emissions mitigation strategy\nOur GHG emissions mitigations framework is aligned with the sustainability goals of many of our innovative tenants. Our \nframework directly focuses on reducing emissions from our operations through energy efficiency, electrification and use of alternative \nenergy, and renewable electricity. We indirectly focus on reducing emissions associated with construction activities by engaging with our \nsupply chain and targeting reductions in embodied carbon through procurement, as described below.\nWe are continuing to implement strategies to seek to reduce the emissions intensity of our operating assets: (i) we aim to \nprioritize the energy efficiency and GHG emissions mitigation in our development projects, including through energy-efficient design, \nelectrification, and use of alternative energy; (ii) we further seek to reduce energy consumption in our operating asset base by \nperforming energy audits and by implementing energy conservation measures at certain properties; and (iii) we also continue to \nadvance our renewable electricity strategy with the recent completion of a large-scale solar farm in June 2024, which is now supplying \nrenewable power to meet 100% of the Greater Boston region‘s electricity load for Alexandria-paid accounts through a long-term power \npurchase agreement based on 2023 consumption levels.\nWe aim to reduce emissions associated with construction activities. These activities may include such strategies as engaging \nwith our supply chain and targeting reductions in embodied carbon through procurement. Emissions within our indirect focus will require \nsignificant innovation and cost-effective solutions by the construction industry to develop pathways for substantial emissions reduction.\nBoard of directors and leadership oversight\nThe Audit Committee oversees the management of the Company’s financial and other risks, including climate-related risks. At \nthe management level, Alexandria’s Sustainability Committee, which comprises members of the executive team and senior decision \nmakers spanning the Company’s real estate development, asset management, risk management, and sustainability teams, leads the\ndevelopment and execution of our approach to climate-related risk.\nRefer to “\nItem 1A. Risk factors\n” in this annual report on Form 10-K for discussion of the risks we face from climate change.\n101\nResults of operations\nWe present a tabular comparison of items, whether gain or loss, that may facilitate a high-level understanding of our results \nand provide context for the disclosures included in this annual report on Form 10-K. We believe that such tabular presentation promotes \na better understanding for investors of the corporate-level decisions made and activities performed that significantly affect comparison \nof our operating results from period to period. We also believe that this tabular presentation will supplement for investors an \nunderstanding of our disclosures and real estate operating results. Gains or losses on sales of real estate and impairments of assets \nclassified as held for sale are related to corporate-level decisions to dispose of real estate. Gains or losses on early extinguishment of \ndebt are related to corporate-level financing decisions focused on our capital structure strategy. Significant realized and unrealized \ngains or losses on non-real estate investments, impairments of real estate and non-real estate investments, acceleration of stock \ncompensation expense due to the resignations of executive officers, and initial and subsequent adjustments to the provision for \nexpected credit losses on financial instruments are not related to the operating performance of our real estate assets as they result from \nstrategic, corporate-level non-real estate investment decisions and external market conditions. Impairments of non-real estate \ninvestments are not related to the operating performance of our real estate as they represent the write-down of non-real estate \ninvestments when their fair values decrease below their respective carrying values due to changes in general market or other conditions \noutside of our control.

The \nincrease\n was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues from our Non-\nSame Properties related to\n \n4.7 million\n RSF of development and redevelopment projects\n placed into service subsequent to\n \nJanuary 1, \n2023\n and\n \nsix \noperating properties aggregating \n824,979\n RSF acquire\nd subsequent to \nJanuary 1, 2023\n.\nRental revenues from our Same Properties for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n \nincreased\n by \n$45.4 million\n, or \n2.8%\n, to \n$1.7 billion\n, compared to \n$1.6 billion\n for the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n,\n primarily as a result of\n an increase in rental rates from \nlease renewals and re-leasing of space since \nJanuary 1, 2023\n, \nand a \n0.3%\n increase in the occupancy of our Same Properties to \n94.2%\n \nfor the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n from \n93.9%\n for the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n.\nTenant recoveries\nTenant recoveries for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n \nincreased\n by \n$46.9 million\n, or \n6.7%\n, to \n$745.4 million\n, compared to \n$698.5 million\n for the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n. This \nincrease\n was partially from our Non-Same Properties related to our \ndevelopment and redevelopment projects placed into service and properties acquired \nsubsequent to \nJanuary 1, 2023\n, as discussed \nabove under “Rental revenues.” \nSame Properties tenant recoveries for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n \nincreased\n by \n$14.2 million\n, or \n2.4%\n, to \n$612.6 million\n, compared to \n$598.4 million\n for the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n, primarily due to higher operating expenses during \nthe \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n, as discussed under “Rental operations” below. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n92%\n \nof ou\nr leases (on an \nannual rental revenue basis)\n were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, \nrepairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.\nRental operations\nTotal rental operating expenses for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n \nincreased\n by \n$50.1 million\n, or \n5.8%\n, to \n$909.3 million\n, \ncompared to \n$859.2 million\n for the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n. The \nincrease\n was primarily due to incremental expenses related to \nour Same Properties rental operating expenses, as discussed below.\nSame Properties rental operating expenses \nincreased\n by \n$41.4 million\n, or \n6.0%\n, to \n$735.0 million\n during the \nyear ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, compared to \n$693.6 million\n for the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n, primarily as the result of increases in:\n (i) costs \nrelated to engineering, security, janitorial and other operating contracts of \n$9.6 million\n mainly due to higher rates,\n (ii) property taxes of \n$8.6 million\n primarily due to increases from reassessments in values, and (iii) utilities expenses of \n$6.3 million\n and property insurance of \n$1.9 million\n primarily due to higher rates. \nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n \nincreased\n by \n$108.9 million\n, or \n10.0%\n, to \n$1.2 billion\n, compared to \n$1.1 billion\n for the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n. The \nincrease\n was primarily due to additional depreciation \nfrom development and redevelopment projects placed into service and properties acquired, as discussed above under “\nRental \nrevenues\n.”\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n \ndecreased\n by \n$31.0 million\n, or \n15.5%\n, to \n$168.4 million\n, compared to \n$199.4 million\n for the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n, p\nrimarily due to a reduction in compensation costs \nincluding the impact from the resignations of two executive officers in the second half of 2023, and savings stemming from various \nefficiency initiatives, including implementation of systems upgrades, process improvements, and smarter technology. As a percentage of \nnet operating income, our general and administrative expenses for the trailing twelve months ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n were \n7.6%\n and \n9.8%\n, respectively\n. \n105\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nComponent\n2024\n2023\nChange\nGross interest\n$\n516,799\n$\n438,182\n$\n78,617\nCapitalized interest\n(330,961)\n(363,978)\n33,017\nInterest expense\n$\n185,838\n$\n74,204\n$\n111,634\nAverage debt balance outstanding\n(1)\n$\n12,583,339\n$\n11,242,532\n$\n1,340,807\nWeighted-average annual interest rate\n(2)\n4.1\n%\n3.9\n%\n0.2\n%\n(1)\nRepresents the average debt balance outstanding during the respective periods.\n(2)\nRepresents annualized total interest incurred divided by the average debt balance outstanding during the respective periods.\nThe net change in interest expense during the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n, compared to the \nyear ended December 31, \n2023\n, resulted from the following (dollars in thousands):\nComponent\nInterest Rate\n(1)\nEffective Date\nChange\nIncreases in interest incurred due to:\nIssuances of debt:\n$500 million of unsecured senior notes payable due 2053\n5.26%\nFebruary 2023\n$\n3,226\n$500 million of unsecured senior notes payable due 2035\n4.88%\nFebruary 2023\n2,984\n$600 million of unsecured senior notes payable due 2054\n5.71%\nFebruary 2024\n29,634\n$400 million of unsecured senior notes payable due 2036\n5.38%\nFebruary 2024\n18,483\nIncreases in construction borrowings and interest rates under secured \nnotes payable\n7.52%\n3,882\nHigher average outstanding balances and/or rate increases on borrowings \nunder commercial paper program and unsecured senior line of credit\n17,747\nOther increase in interest\n2,661\nChange in gross interest\n78,617\nDecrease in capitalized interest\n33,017\nTotal change in interest expense\n$\n111,634\n(1)\nRepresents the weighted-average interest rate as of the end of the applicable period, including amortization of loan fees, amortization of debt premiums (discounts), and \nother bank fees.\nImpairment of real estate\nD\nuring the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n, we recognized real estate impairment charges aggregating \n$223.1 million\n, which \nprimarily consisted of the following: \n•\nIn October 2024, \nfour\n properties at One Moderna Way in our Route 128 submarket met the criteria for c\nlassification as held for \nsale when a single tenant, occupying 100%\n of these properties with\n a weighted-average remaining lease term of 18 years, \ncommitted to purchasing them. Due to our important long-established relationship with this tenant and the strategic nature of \nthese properties, there were no other buyers to whom we would be willing to sell these properties. As a result, the sale of these \nassets became probable and all criteria for classification as held for sale were met when the tenant’s commitment to acquire \nthese properties was confirmed in October 2024. Upon meeting the asset held for sale criteria, we recognized an impairment \ncharge of \n$40.9 million\n to reduce the carrying amounts of these properties to the expected sales price less costs to sell. In \nD\necember 2024\n, we completed the sale of these properties for a sales price of\n \n$369.4 million\n, with no incremental gain or loss \nrecognized. \n•\nIn October 2024, \nfive\n operating properties aggregating \n203,223\n RSF and land parcels aggregating \n1.5 million\n SF in our \nSorrento Mesa and University Town Center submarkets met the criteria for classification as held for sale. In October 2024, \nafter meeting all criteria for classification as held for sale, including (i) our commitment to sell these assets, (ii) Board of \nDirectors’ approval, and (iii) our determination that the sale of each property was probable within one year, we recognized \nimpairment charges aggregating \n$65.9 million\n to reduce the carrying amounts of these properties to the expected aggregate \nsales price less costs to sell. Subsequent to October 2024, we had the following additional developments related to these \ntransactions: \n106\n•\nIn December 2024, based on an executed purchase and sales agreement, we recognized an additional\n \n$36.9 million\n \nimpairment charge related to\n \nthree\n operating properties\n aggregating\n \n100,831\n RSF\n and land parcels aggregating\n \n1.0 \nmillion\n SF (\nincluded in the aforementioned\n \n203,223\n RSF\n and\n \n1.5 million\n S\nF, respectively)\n in our University Town Center \nsubmarket to further reduce the carrying amounts of these properties to their estimated fair values less costs to sell of \napproximately\n \n$200 million\n. As of December 31, 2024, these assets were classified as held for sale, and we expect to \ncomplete the sales of these assets within 12 months. \n•\nWe continue to hold \ntwo\n operating properties aggregating\n \n102,392\n RSF (included in the aforementioned \n203,223\n RSF) in \nour Sorrento Mesa submarket with a carrying amount of\n \n$18.2 million\n as held for sale as of December 31, 202\n4. We \nexpect to complete the sale of these properties within 12 months.\n•\nIn December 2024, we completed the sale of land parcels aggregating\n \n444,041\n SF \n(included in the \n1.5 million\n SF \ndiscussed above) in our Sorrento Mesa submarket for a sales price of\n \n$55.0 million\n, with no gain or loss recognized\n in \nearnings, to a buyer that is expected to develop residential properties on this site. As part of the transaction, we provided\n \n$25.0 million\n of seller financing.\n This note receivable is classified within “Other assets” in our consolidated balance sheet. \nRefer to Note 8 – “Other assets” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n•\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, \nthree\n properties aggregating \n552,513\n RSF in our Cambridge submarket \nmet the criteria for classification as held for sale upon our decision to dispose of them as a result of our determination that they \nwere not core to our Megacampus strategy due to their size, location, and existing use. Upon meeting the criteria for \nclassification as held for sale, we recognized an impairment charge of \n$6.3 million\n to reduce the carrying amounts of these \nproperties to their estimated fair values less costs to sell. In December 2024, we completed the sale of these properties for a \nsales price of \n$245.5 million\n. \n•\nIn addition, we recognized impairment charges aggregating \n$30.8 million\n primarily consisting of the pre-acquisition costs \nrelated to two potential acquisitions aggregating \n1.4 million\n RSF of future development in our Greater Boston market. We \nexecuted purchase agreements for these potential acquisitions with the total purchase price aggregating \n$366.8 million\n in 2020 \nand 2022 and initially expected to close these acquisitions after 2024. Our intent for each site included the demolition of \nexisting buildings upon expiration of the existing in-place leases and the development of life science properties. During the \nthree months ended June 30, 2024, due to the existing macroeconomic environment that negatively impacted the financial \noutlook for these projects, we decided to no longer proceed with these acquisitions, resulting in the recognition of impairment \ncharges. \n•\nIn December 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of\n \n$13.7 million\n to reduce the carrying amount of a property \naggregating\n \n45,615\n RSF\n in our Seattle market to its \nestimated fair value less costs to sell of approximately \n$8 million\n, upon \nmeeting the criteria for classification as held for sale. We expect to sell this project within 12 months.\n•\nIn December 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of\n \n$6.1 million\n to reduce the carrying amount of a development \nproject aggregating\n \n1.4 million\n SF\n in our Texas market to its estimated fair value less costs to sell of approximately\n \n$70 million\n, \nupon meeting the criteria for classification as held for sale. We expect to sell this project\n within 12 months.\nDuring the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n, we recognized real estate impairment charges aggregating \n$461.1 million\n \nclassified in impairment of real estate in our consolidated statement of operations, which primarily related to properties in non-strategic \nlocations that are not integral to our Megacampus strategy and were sold or were classified as held for sale \nas of December 31, 2023\n. \nInvestment \nloss\nDuring the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n, we recognized an investment \nloss\n aggregating \n$53.1 million\n, \nwhich consisted of \n$117.2 million\n of realized \ngains\n,\n \n$112.2 million\n of unrealized \nlosses\n, and\n impairment charges of \n$58.1 million\n.\nDuring the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n, we recognized an investment \nloss\n aggregating \n$195.4 million\n, which consisted of \n$6.1 million\n of realized \ngains\n and \n$201.5 million\n of unrealized \nlosses\n.\n For more information about our investments, refer to Note 7 – “Investments” to our consolidated financial statements in Item \n15 in this annual report on Form 10-K.

The gains were classified in gain on sales of \nreal estate within our consolidated statement of operations for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n.\nDuring the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n, we recognized \n$277.0 million\n of gains\n related to the dispositions of \n13\n real estat\ne \nassets.

Our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and \nuncertainties, including those discussed as “Forward-looking statements” under Part I; “\nItem 1A. Risk factors\n”; and “\nItem 7. \nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n” in this annual report on Form 10-K. We expect to \nupdate our forecast for key sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis.\n117\nSources of capital\nNet cash provided by operating activities after dividends\nWe expect to retain \n$425 million\n to \n$525 million\n of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock \ndividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the year ending \nDecember 31, 2025\n. For purposes of this calculation, changes \nin operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences. For the year ending \nDecember 31, 2025\n, we expect \nour recently delivered projects, our development and redevelopment projects expected to be delivered, contributions from Same \nProperties, and recently acquired income-producing properties to contribute increases in income from rentals, net operating income, \nand cash flows. We anticipate contractual near-term growth in annual net operating income (cash basis) of \n$70 million\n related to the \ncommencement of contractual rents on the projects recently placed into service that are near the end of their initial free rent period. \nRefer to “\nCash flows\n” in Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of cash flows provided by operating activities for the \nyear ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n.\nDebt\nWe expect to fund a portion of our capital needs for \n2025\n from issuances under our commercial paper program, issuances of \nunsecured senior notes payable, borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, and/or borrowings under our secured \nconstruction loan.\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, our unsecured senior line of credit had aggregate commitments of\n \n$5.0 billion\n with an interest rate \nof SOFR plus \n0.855%\n, and in \nSeptember 2024, we extended the maturity date from \nJanuary 22, 2028\n to \nJanuary 22, 2030\n. In addition \nto the cost of borrowing, the unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an \nannual facility fee of \n0.145%\n based on the aggregate \ncommitments outstanding\n. Based upon our ability to achieve certain annual sustainability targets, the interest rate and facility fee rate \nare also subject to upward or downward adjustments of up to \nfour\n basis points with respect to the interest rate and up to \none\n basis point \nwith respect to the facility fee rate. \nBased on certain sustainability metrics achieved in accordance with the terms of our unsecured senior line of credit \nagreement,\n the borrowing rate was reduced for a one-year period by \ntwo\n basis points to SOFR plus \n0.855%\n, from SOFR plus \n0.875%\n, \nand the facility fee was reduced by \n0.5\n basis point to \n0.145%\n from \n0.15%\n.\n \nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had \nno\n outstanding balance on \nour unsecured senior line of credit. \nOur commercial paper program provides us with the ability to issue up to \n$2.5 billion\n of commercial paper notes with a maturity \nof generally \n30\n days or less and with a maximum maturity of \n397\n days from the date of issuance\n. Our commercial paper program is \nbacked by our unsecured senior line of credit, and at all times we expect to retain a minimum undrawn amount of borrowing capacity \nunder our unsecured senior line of credit equal to any outstanding balance under our commercial paper program. We use borrowings \nunder the program to fund short-term capital needs. The notes issued under our commercial paper program are sold under customary \nterms in the commercial paper market. They are typically issued at a discount to par, representing a yield to maturity dictated by market \nconditions at the time of issuance. In the event we are unable to issue commercial paper notes or refinance outstanding commercial \npaper notes under terms equal to or more favorable than those under the unsecured senior line of credit, we expect to borrow under the \nunsecured senior line of credit. The commercial paper notes sold during the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n were issued at a\n weighted-\naverage yield to maturity of \n5.30%\n. \nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had \nno\n outstanding balance on our commercial paper program\n.\nIn February 2024, we issued \n$1.0 billion\n of unsecured senior notes payable with a weighted-average interest rate of \n5.48%\n \nand a weighted-average maturity of \n23.1 years\n. The unsecured senior notes consisted of \n$400.0 million\n of \n5.25%\n unsecured senior \nnotes due \n2036\n and \n$600.0 million\n of \n5.625%\n unsecured senior notes due \n2054\n. \n118\nThe following table presents our average debt outstanding and weighted-average interest rates during the \nyear ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n (dollars in thousands): \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nAverage Debt \nOutstanding\nWeighted-Average \nInterest Rate\nLong-term fixed-rate debt\n$\n12,049,708\n3.77\n%\nShort-term variable-rate unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper \nprogram debt\n643,545\n5.40\nBlended-average interest rate\n12,693,253\n3.85\nLoan fee amortization and annual facility fee related to unsecured senior line of \ncredit\nN/A\n0.12\nTotal/weighted average\n$\n12,693,253\n3.97\n%\nReal estate dispositions and sales of partial interests\nWe expect to continue to focus on the disciplined execution of select sales of real estate. Future sales will provide an important \nsource of capital to fund a portion of pending and recently completed acquisitions, our development and redevelopment projects, and \nopportunistic share repurchases, and also provide significant capital for growth. We may also consider additional sales of partial \ninterests in core Class A/A+ properties, development projects, and/or land. For the year ending December 31, \n2025\n, we expect real \nestate dispositions and sales of partial interests in real estate assets to range from\n \n$1.2 billion\n to \n$2.2 billion\n. \nThe amount of asset sales \nnecessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of EBITDA associated with the assets sold.\nRefer to Note 3 – “Investments in real estate,” Note 4 – “Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures,” and \nNote 15 – “Stockholders’ equity” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 and “Dispositions and sales of partial interests” in \nItem 2 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information on our real estate dispositions.\nAs a REIT, we are generally subject to a 100% tax on the net income from real estate asset sales that the IRS characterizes as \n“prohibited transactions.” We do not expect our sales will be categorized as prohibited transactions. However, unless we meet certain \n“safe harbor” requirements, whether a real estate asset sale is a “prohibited transaction” will be based on the facts and circumstances \nof the sale. Our real estate asset sales may not always meet such “safe harbor” requirements. Refer to “\nItem 1A. Risk factors\n” in this \nannual report on Form 10-K for additional information about the “prohibited transaction” tax.\nCommon equity transactions\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, we entered into new forward equity sales agreements aggregating \n$28 million\n \nto sell \n230 thousand\n shares\n of common stock under our ATM program at an average price per share of \n$122.32\n (before underwriting \ndiscounts). \n \nDuring the \nthree months ended December 31, 2024\n, we settled all outstanding forward equity sales agreements by issuing \n230 thousand\n shares\n of common stock at an average price per share of\n \n$120.93\n and received net proceeds of\n \n$27.8 million\n, before \noffering costs\n. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the remaining aggregate amount available under our ATM program for future sales of common \nstock was \n$1.47 billion\n.\nOther sources\nAs a well-known seasoned issuer, we may, from time to time issue securities at our discretion based on our needs and market \nconditions, including, as necessary, to balance our use of incremental debt capital.\nAdditionally, we, together with joint venture partners, hold interests in real estate joint ventures that we consolidate in our \nfinancial statements. These existing joint ventures provide significant equity capital to fund a portion of our future construction spend, \nand our joint venture partners may also contribute equity into these entities for financing-related activities. \nFrom \nJanuary 1, 2025\n \nthrough December 31, \n2028\n, we expect to receive capital contributions aggregating \n$684.1 million\n from existing consolidated real estate \njoint venture partners to fund construction. During the year ending December 31, \n2025\n, contributions from noncontrolling interests from \nexisting joint venture partners are expected to aggregate \n$230.0 million\n.\n119\nUses of capital\nSummary of capital expenditures\nOne of our primary uses of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction of properties. \nW\ne currently have projects in our \ndevelopment and redevelopment pipeline aggregating \n4.4 million\n RSF of Class A/A+ properties \nundergoing construction\n and \n1.9 million\n RSF of priority anticipated\n development and redevelopment projects\n.\n We incur capitalized \nconstruction costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and other construction activities. We also incur additional \ncapitalized project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, \nredevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project, during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its \nintended use are in progress. Refer to “New Class A/A+ development and redevelopment properties: current projects” in Item 2 and \n“Summary of capital expenditures” in Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information on our capital expenditures.\nWe capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period in which activities necessary to prepare an asset for \nits intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. Capitalized \ninterest for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n of \n$331.0 million\n and \n$364.0 million\n, respectively, was classified in \ninvestments in real estate in our consolidated balance sheets. The \ndecrease\n in capitalized interest was related to a \nlower\n weighted-\naverage capitalized cost basis of \n$8.1 billion\n for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n, as compared to \n$9.5 billion\n for the \nyear ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, partially offset by an \nincrease\n in weighted-average interest rate used to capitalize interest to \n3.97%\n for the \nyear \nended December 31, 2024\n from \n3.79%\n for the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n. \nProperty taxes, insurance on real estate, and indirect project costs, such as construction, administration, legal fees, and office \ncosts that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is \nundergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. We capitalized payroll and other indirect costs related to development, \nredevelopment, pre-construction, and construction projects, aggregating \n$100.9 million\n and\n \n$108.4 million\n, and property taxes, \ninsurance on real estate and indirect project costs aggregating \n$132.3 million\n and \n$129.1 million\n du\nring the years ended \nDecember 31, \n2024\n and \n2023\n, respectively. \nThe \ndecrease\n in our capitalized costs for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n, compared to the same period in \n2023\n, was \nprimarily driven by a reduction in the average real estate basis of our development and redevelopment pipeline following significant \ndeliveries in \n2023\n, most of which were placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2023. Pre-construction activities include \nentitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building \nimprovements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective \ntenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of \nbuildings. Should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain \nother direct and indirect project costs related to the asset would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance \nare expensed as incurred.\nFluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total \nexpenses and net income. For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction \nactivities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased \nby approximately\n \n$56.4 million\n for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n.\nWe use third-party brokers to assist in our leasing activity, who are paid on a contingent basis upon successful leasing. We are \nrequired to capitalize initial direct costs related to successful leasing transactions that result directly from and are essential to the lease \ntransaction and would not have been incurred had that lease transaction not been successfully executed. During the \nyear ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we capitalized total initial direct leasing costs of \n$91.8 million\n. Costs that we incur to negotiate or arrange a lease \nregardless of its outcome, such as fixed employee compensation, tax, or legal advice to negotiate lease terms, and other costs, are \nexpensed as incurred.\n120\nReal estate acquisitions and common stock repurchase program\nOn \nDecember 9, 2024\n, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program under \nwhich we may repurchase up to \n$500.0 million\n of our common stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or \notherwise through \nDecember 31, 2025\n. Share repurchases are expected to be funded on a leverage-neutral basis with net cash \nprovided by operating activities after dividends and proceeds from dispositions and sales of partial interests.\n•\nIn December 2024, we repurchased\n \n496,276\n \nshares\n of common stock.\n•\nFrom \nJanuary 1, 2025\n through \nJanuary 27, 2025\n, we repurchased \n1.5 million\n shares of additional common stock.\n•\nAs of the date of this report, cumulative repurchases under the program \naggregated \n$200.1 million\n and \n2.0 million\n shares of \ncommon stock at an average price per share of \n$98.16\n.\n•\nAs of the date of this report, the approximate value of shares authorized and remaining under this program was \n$299.9 million\n.\n \nFor the year ending December 31, \n2025\n, we expect real estate acquisitions and common stock repurchases to range from \n$—\n \nto \n$200 million\n. Refer to “Acquisitions” in Note 3 – “Investments in real estate” and to Note 4 – “Consolidated and unconsolidated real \nestate joint ventures” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 and “Acquisitions” in Item 2 in this annual report on Form 10-K \nfor information on our acquisitions.\nDividends\nDuring the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, we paid common stock dividends of\n \n$898.6 million\n and \n$847.5 million\n, \nrespectively. The \nincrease\n of\n \n$51.1 million\n in dividends paid on our common stock during the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n, \ncompared to the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n, was primarily due to an increase in the number of common shares outstanding \nsubsequent to \nJanuary 1, 2023\n as a result of settled forward equity sales agreements, and an increase in the related dividends to\n \n$5.14\n \nper common share paid during the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n from \n$4.90\n per common share paid during the \nyear ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n. \nSecured notes payable\nSecured notes payable as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n consisted of \nthree\n notes secured by \ntwo\n properties\n. Our secured notes \npayable typically require monthly payments of principal and interest and had a weighted-average interest rate of approximately \n7.51%\n.\n \nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the total book value of our investments in real estate securing debt was approximately\n \n$368.2 million\n. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, our secured notes payable, including unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs, comprised \napproximately\n \n$587 thousand\n and \n$149.3 million\n of fixed-rate debt and unhedged variable-rate debt\n, respectively. \nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, our unconsolidated real estate joint venture in which we hold a 10% ownership interest, located at \n1655 and 1725 Third Street in our Mission Bay submarket, has a \n$600.0 million\n secured loan outstanding maturing on \nMarch 10, 2025\n. \nThe unconsolidated real estate joint venture is in the process of refinancing approximately\n \n$500 million\n of this debt with a new secured \nnote payable, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. The remaining debt balance of approximately \n$100 million\n will be \nrepaid through contributions from the unconsolidated joint venture partners. We expect to contribute our share of approximately \n$10 \nmillion\n \nin the first quarter of 2025. \nUnsecured senior notes payable and unsecured senior line of credit\nThe requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our unsecured senior \nnotes payable as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n were as follows: \nCovenant Ratios\n(1)\nRequirement\nDecember 31, 2024\nTotal Debt to Total Assets\nLess than or equal to 60%\n29%\nSecured Debt to Total Assets\nLess than or equal to 40%\n0.4%\nConsolidated EBITDA\n(2)\n to Interest Expense\nGreater than or equal to 1.5x\n11.0x\nUnencumbered Total Asset Value to Unsecured Debt\nGreater than or equal to 150%\n330%\n(1)\nAll covenant ratio titles utilize terms as defined in the respective debt agreements. \n(2)\nThe calculation of consolidated EBITDA is based on the definitions contained in our loan agreements and is not directly comparable to the computation of EBITDA as \ndescribed in Exchange Act Release No. 47226.\nIn addition, the terms of the indentures, among other things, limit the ability of the Company, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, \nL.P., and the Company’s subsidiaries to (i) consummate a merger, or consolidate, or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets \nand (ii) incur certain secured or unsecured indebtedness.\n121\nThe requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our unsecured senior line \nof credit as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n were as follows: \nCovenant Ratios\n(1)\nRequirement\nDecember 31, 2024\nLeverage Ratio\nLess than or equal to 60.0%\n29.5%\nSecured Debt Ratio\nLess than or equal to 45.0%\n0.3%\nFixed-Charge Coverage Ratio\nGreater than or equal to 1.50x\n3.91x\nUnsecured Interest Coverage Ratio\nGreater than or equal to 1.75x\n10.38x\n(1)\nAll covenant ratio titles utilize terms as defined in the credit agreement. \nEstimated interest payments\nEstimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt are calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including interest \npayment dates and scheduled maturity dates. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n98.8%\n of our debt was fixed-rate debt\n. For additional \ninformation regarding our debt, refer to Note 10 – “Secured and unsecured senior debt” to our consolidated financial statements in \nItem 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K. \nGround lease obligations\nGround lease obligations as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n included leases for \n32\n of our properties and accounted for approximately \n8%\n of our total number of properties. Among these \n32\n properties, \n17\n properties are subject to ground leases with a weighted-average \nremaining lease term of \n41\n years\n, including extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. \nThese leases are with a sin\ngle \nlessor in our Greater Stanford submarket with whom we have extended three ground leases over the past 10 years.\n \nOur remaining \n15\n properties subject to ground leases are located across multiple submarkets and have remaining lease terms \nranging from approximately\n \n46\n to \n82\n \nyears\n. The weighted-average remaining lease term of these ground leases is \n71\n years\n, including \nextension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise.\nIn many cases, we seek to extend our ground leases well ahead of their scheduled contractual expirations. If we are \nsuccessful in extending ground leases, we could see significant up-front or increased recurring future payments to the ground lessor \nand/or increased ground lease expense, which may require us to increase our capital funding needs.\nOperating lease agreements\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the remaining contractual payments under ground and office lease agreements in which we are the \nlessee aggregated \n$925.0 million\n and \n$24.4 million\n, respectively. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, our operating lease liability, calculated as \nthe present value of the remaining payments aggregating \n$949.4 million\n under our operating lease agreements, including our extension \noptions that we are reasonably certain to exercise, was \n$507.1 million\n, which was classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, \nand other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the weighted-average remaining lease term of \noperating leases in which we are the lessee was approximately \n56 years\n, including extension options that we are reasonably certain to \nexercise, and the weighted-average discount rate was \n4.9%\n. Our corresponding operating lease right-of-use assets, adjusted for initial \ndirect leasing costs and other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, aggregated \n$764.5 million\n. We classify the right-of-use asset in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to “\nLease accounting\n” in \nNote 2 – “Summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 in this annual report on \nForm 10-K for additional information. \nIncluded in the aforementioned \nDecember 31, 2024\n balances is the ground lease recorded in July 2024 upon our execution of \nan amendment to our existing ground lease agreement at the Alexandria Technology Square\n®  \nMegacampus aggregating \n1.2 million\n RSF in our Cambridge submarket\n, which extended the term by \n24 years\n from \nJanuary 1, 2065\n to \nDecember 31, 2088\n. The \namendment required that we prepay our entire rent obligation for the extended lease term aggregating \n$270.0 million\n in two equal \ninstallments during the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025\n. During the three months ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we \nmade the first installment payment aggregating\n \n$135.0 million\n. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the second installment payment aggregating \n$135.0 million\n remained outstanding and was paid on \nJanuary 14, 2025\n. Alexandria Technology Square\n®\n is a foundational Megacampus \nin the heart of the global life science ecosystem in Cambridge and is the Greater Boston base of operations of key strategic tenants \nsuch as GlaxoSmithKline plc, Novartis AG, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Mass General Brigham. Securing this ground \nlease through \nDecember 2088\n significantly enhances the long-term value of our investment in this critical Megacampus.\n122\nCommitments\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing \ndevelopment, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated\n \n$1.0 billion\n. We expect payments for these \nobligations to occur over \none\n to \nthree\n years\n, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We may have the ability to cease \nthe construction of certain projects, which would result in the reduction of our commitments. In addition, we have letters of credit and \nperformance obligations aggregating \n$29.5 million\n.\nWe are committed to funding approximately \n$399.2 million\n related to our non-real estate investments. These funding \ncommitments are primarily associated with our investments in privately held entities that report NAV and expire at various dates over \nthe next \n12 years\n, with a weighted-average expiration of \n8.2 years\n \nas of December 31, 2024\n.\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the second installment payment related to the amendment of our existing ground lease agreement \nat the Alexandria Technology Square\n®\n Megacampus aggregating \n$135.0 million\n remained outstanding and was paid on \nJanuary 14, \n2025\n. \nRefer to “Operating lease agreements” above for additional details. \nExposure to environmental liabilities\nIn connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain \nthe existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not \nrevealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of \noperations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I \nenvironmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to \ncertain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.\nForeign currency translation gains and losses\nThe following table presents the change in accumulated other comprehensive \nloss\n attributable to Alexandria Real Estate \nEquities, Inc.’s stockholders during the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n primarily due to the changes in the foreign exchange rates for \nour real estate investments in Canada (in thousands). We reclassify unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses into net \nincome as we dispose of these holdings.\nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n(15,896)\nOther comprehensive loss before reclassifications\n(29,719)\nReclassification adjustment for loss included in net income\n(637)\n(1)\nNet other comprehensive loss\n(30,356)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n(46,252)\n(1)\nPrimarily relates to the completion of the sale of \none\n property in our Canada market during the three months ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and substantial liquidation of the \nassociated foreign entity.\nInflation\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, approximately\n \n92%\n \nof\n our leases (on an annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which \nrequire tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and \nother operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately\n \n97%\n \nof our leases (on an annual rental \nrevenue basis) contained effective annual rent escalations approximating\n \n3%\n that were either fixed or indexed base\nd on a consumer \nprice index or other indices. Accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to \nsignificant risks from inflation. A period of inflation, however, could cause an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, \nincluding borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program, issuances of unsecured senior notes \npayable, and borrowings under our secured construction loans, and secured loans held by our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.\nIn addition, refer to “Item 1A. Risk factors” in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion about risks that inflation directly \nor indirectly may pose to our business.\n123\nIssuer and guarantor subsidiary summarized financial information\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (the “Issuer”) has sold certain debt securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, \nas amended, that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P. (the “LP” or the “Guarantor \nSubsidiary”), an indirectly 100% owned subsidiary of the Issuer. The Issuer’s other subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, the \nsubsidiaries that own substantially all of its real estate (collectively, the “Combined Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”), will not provide a \nguarantee of such securities, including the subsidiaries that are partially or 100% owned by the LP. The following summarized financial \ninformation presents on a combined basis, balance sheet information as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, and results of operations and \ncomprehensive income for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n for the Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiary.

The preparation of these financial \nstatements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of \nassets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current \ntrends, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. \nWe continually evaluate the estimates, judgments, and assumptions we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements\n. \nC\nhanges in estimates, judgments, or assumptions could affect our financial position and our results of operations, which are used by \nour stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. \nOur critical accounting estimates are defined as accounting estimates or assumptions made in accordance with GAAP, which \ninvolve a significant level of estimation uncertainty or subjectivity and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our \nfinancial condition or results of operations. Our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are \ndescribed in Note 2 – “Summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 in this annual \nreport on Form 10-K. Our critical accounting estimates are described below.\nRecognition of real estate acquired\nGenerally, our acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate are accounted for as asset acquisitions and not business \ncombinations because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable \nassets (i.e., land, buildings, and related intangible assets). The accounting model for asset acquisitions requires that the acquisition \nconsideration (including acquisition costs) be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value \nbasis. Any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities \nassumed is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. \nWe assess the relative fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on: \n(i)\nAvailable comparable market information; \n(ii)\nEstimated replacement costs; or\n(iii)\nDiscounted cash flow analysis/estimated net operating income and capitalization rates.\nIn certain instances, we may use multiple valuation techniques and estimate fair values based on an average of multiple \nvaluation results. We exercise judgement to determine key assumptions used in each valuation technique. For example, to estimate \nfuture cash flows in the discounted cash flow analysis, we are required to use judgment and make a number of assumptions, including \nthose related to projected growth in rental rates and operating expenses, and anticipated trends and market/economic conditions. The \nuse of different assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis can affect the amount of consideration allocated to the acquired \ndepreciable/amortizable asset, which in turn can impact our net income due to the recognition of the related depreciation/amortization \nexpense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe completed acquisitions of \ntwo\n properties for a total purchase price of \n$249.4 million\n during the \nyear ended December 31, \n2024\n. These transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative \nfair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Refer to “Investments in real estate” in Note 2 – “Summary of significant \naccounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n \nImpairment of real estate assets classified as held for sale\nA property is classified as held for sale when all of the accounting criteria for a plan of sale have been met. These criteria are \ndescribed in “Investments in real estate” in Note 2 – “Summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial \nstatements in Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K. Upon classification as held for sale, we recognize an impairment charge, if \nnecessary, to lower the carrying amount of the real estate asset to its estimated fair value less cost to sell. The determination of fair \nvalue can involve significant judgments and assumptions. We develop key assumptions based on the following available factors: (i) \ncontractual sales price, (ii) preliminary non-binding letters of intent, or (iii) other available comparable market information. If this \ninformation is not available, we use estimated replacement costs or estimated cash flow projections that utilize estimated discount and \ncapitalization rates. These estimates are subject to uncertainty and therefore require significant judgment by us. We review all assets \nheld for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to their \nestimated fair values less costs to sell. Subsequently, as a result of our quarterly assessment, we may recognize an incremental \nimpairment charge for any decrease in the asset’s fair value less cost to sell. Conversely, we may recognize a gain for a subsequent \nincrease in fair value less cost to sell, limited to the cumulative net loss previously recognized. \n125\nImpairment of other long-lived assets\nFor each reporting period, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our long-lived assets, \nincluding our rental properties, CIP, land held for development, right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the \nlessee, and intangibles, to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an impairment analysis. If \ntriggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, including, if \nnecessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.\nLong-lived assets to be held and used, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that \nthe carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not \nrecoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. \nTriggering events or impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, CIP, land held for \ndevelopment, and intangibles, are assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, \noccupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, \nestimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon \nnumerous factors, including, but not limited to, projected rental rates, exit capitalization rates, and construction costs for projects under \ndevelopment, which are based on available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/\neconomic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-\nweighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration. \nUpon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its \nestimated fair value. If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation or amortization is adjusted \nprospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period \nthat the asset is expected to be held and used. We may also adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or \nredeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.\nThe evaluation for impairment and calculation of the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used involves \nconsideration of factors and calculations that are different than the estimate of fair value of assets classified as held for sale. Because of \nthese two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an \nimpairment charge upon classification as held for sale.\nImpairment of non-real estate investments\nWe hold strategic investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved \nin the life science \nindustry\n. As a REIT, we generally limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than \n10%\n.\nOur investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV per share require our evaluation for impairment when changes \nin these entities’ conditions may indicate that an impairment exists. We closely monitor these investments throughout the year for new \ndevelopments, including operating results, prospects and results of clinical trials, new product initiatives, new collaborative agreements, \ncapital-raising events, and merger and acquisition activities. We evaluate these investees on the basis of a qualitative assessment for \nindicators of impairment by monitoring the presence of the following triggering events or impairment indicators: (i) a significant \ndeterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee; (ii) a significant adverse \nchange in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (iii) a significant adverse change in the general \nmarket condition, including the research and development of technology and products that the investee is bringing or attempting to \nbring to the market, (iv) significant concerns about the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern, and/or (v) a decision by \ninvestors to cease providing support to reduce their financial commitment to the investee. If such indicators are present, we are required \nto estimate the investment’s fair value and immediately recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the investment’s carrying \nvalue in excess of its estimated fair value. As of each \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n2023\n, and \n2022\n, the carrying amounts of our investments in \nprivately held entities that do not report NAV per share accounted for \n2%\n, \n1%\n, and \n2%\n \nof our total assets and aggregated \n$575.2 million\n, \n$542.9 million\n, and \n$582.7 million\n, respectively. During the years ended December 31, \n2024\n, \n2023\n, and \n2022\n, we \nrecognized impairment charges aggregating \n10%\n, \n14%\n, and \n4%\n,\n respectively, of the carrying amounts of our investments in privately \nheld entities that do not report NAV.\n126\nMonitoring of tenant credit quality\nWe monitor, on an ongoing basis, the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants by (i) monitoring the credit \nrating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are \npublicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our \ntenants and their respective businesses and industries in which they conduct business, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease \npayments. We have a team of employees who, among them, have an extensive educational background or experience in biology, \nchemistry, industrial biotechnology, agtech, and the life science industry, as well as knowledge in finance. This team is responsible for \ntimely assessment, monitoring, and communication of our tenants’ credit quality and any material changes therein. During the years \nended \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n, \n2023\n, and \n2022\n, specific write-offs and increases to our general allowance related to deferred rent balances \nof tenants recognized in our consolidated statements of operations have not exceeded\n \n0.8%\n of our income from rentals for each \nrespective year. For additional information, refer to “\nMonitoring of tenant credit quality\n” in Note 2 – “Summary of significant accounting \npolicies” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n127\nDefinitions and reconciliations\nThis section contains additional information on certain non-GAAP financial measures including reconciliations to the most \ndirectly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and the reasons why we use these \nsupplemental measures of performance and believe they provide useful information to investors, as well as the definitions of other \nterms used in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nFunds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common \nstockholders\nGAAP-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish \nover time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the \nNareit Board of Governors established funds from operations as an improved measurement tool. Since its introduction, funds from \noperations has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among equity REITs. We believe that funds from operations is \nhelpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. Moreover, we believe that funds from operations, as \nadjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without \nhaving to account for differences recognized because of real estate acquisition and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital \nstructure, capital market transactions, variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control, or other \ncorporate activities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties. \nThe 2018 White Paper published by the Nareit Board of Governors (the “Nareit White Paper”) defines funds from operations as \nnet income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments of real estate, plus \ndepreciation and amortization of operating real estate assets, and after adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated \npartnerships and real estate joint ventures. Impairments represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability \nperiod is less than the carrying value due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating \nperformance of the properties during the corresponding period.\nWe compute funds from operations, as adjusted, as funds from operations calculated in accordance with the Nareit White \nPaper, excluding significant gains, losses, and impairments realized on non-real estate investments, unrealized gains or losses on non-\nreal estate investments, impairment of real estate primarily consisting of pre-acquisition costs incurred in connection with acquisitions \nwe decided to no longer pursue, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, provision for expected credit losses on financial \ninstruments, significant termination fees, acceleration of stock compensation expense due to the resignations of executive officers, deal \ncosts, the income tax effect related to such items, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock \nawards. We compute the amount that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards using the two-class method. Under the two-\nclass method, we allocate net income (after amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests) to common stockholders and to unvested \nrestricted stock awards by applying the respective weighted-average shares outstanding during each quarter-to-date and year-to-date \nperiod. This may result in a difference of the summation of the quarter-to-date and year-to-date amounts. Neither funds from operations \nnor funds from operations, as adjusted, should be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as \nindications of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of \nliquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. \nThe following table reconciles net income to funds from operations for the share of consolidated real estate joint ventures \nattributable to noncontrolling interests and our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures for the \nthree months and year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n (in thousands):\nNoncontrolling Interest Share of Consolidated \nReal Estate Joint Ventures\nOur Share of Unconsolidated \nReal Estate Joint Ventures\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2024\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nNet income\n$\n46,150\n$\n187,784\n$\n6,635\n$\n7,059\nDepreciation and amortization \nof real estate assets\n34,986\n129,711\n1,061\n4,238\nGain on sales of real estate\n(5,025)\n(5,025)\n(3,328)\n(3,328)\nFunds from operations\n$\n76,111\n$\n312,470\n$\n4,368\n$\n7,969\n128\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common \nstockholders, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, including our share of amounts from \nconsolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, to funds from operations attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, \nInc.’s common stockholders – diluted, and funds from operations attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common \nstockholders – diluted, as adjusted, and the related per share amounts for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n2023\n, and \n2022\n (in \nthousands, except per share amounts).

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated \nas earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses \non early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, impairments of real estate, provision for expected credit losses \non financial instruments, and significant termination fees. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes unrealized gains or losses and significant \nrealized gains or losses and impairments that result from our non-real estate investments. These non-real estate investment amounts \nare classified in our consolidated statements of operations outside of total revenues.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with relevant and useful information as it allows investors to evaluate the \noperating performance of our business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of investing and \nfinancing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments, our capital structure, capital market transactions, and \nvariances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. For example, we exclude gains or losses on the early \nextinguishment of debt to allow investors to measure our performance independent of our indebtedness and capital structure. We \nbelieve that adjusting for the effects of impairments and gains or losses on sales of real estate, significant impairments and realized \ngains or losses on non-real estate investments, provision for expected credit losses on financial instruments, and significant termination \nfees allows investors to evaluate performance from period to period on a consistent basis without having to account for differences \nrecognized because of investing and financing decisions related to our real estate and non-real estate investments or other corporate \nactivities that may not be representative of the operating performance of our properties.\nIn addition, we believe that excluding charges related to stock compensation and unrealized gains or losses facilitates for \ninvestors a comparison of our business activities across periods without the volatility resulting from market forces outside of our control. \nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a measure of our performance. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our historical expenditures or \nfuture requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure of performance, \nit does not represent net income (loss) or cash flows from operations calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, and it should \nnot be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity.\nIn order to calculate the Adjusted EBITDA margin, we divide Adjusted EBITDA by total revenues as presented in our \nconsolidated statements of operations. We believe that this supplemental performance measure provides investors with additional \nuseful information regarding the profitability of our operating activities.\nWe are not able to forecast the net income of future periods without unreasonable effort and therefore do not provide a \nreconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA on a forward-looking basis. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and/or \namount of items that depend on market conditions outside of our control, including the timing of dispositions, capital events, and \nfinancing decisions, as well as quarterly components such as gain on sales of real estate, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate \ninvestments, impairment of real estate, impairment of non-real estate investments, and provision for expected credit losses on financial \ninstruments. Our attempt to predict these amounts may produce significant but inaccurate estimates, which would be potentially \nmisleading for our investors.\n131\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in \naccordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and calculates the Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three months and years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n (dollars in thousands): \nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(16,095)\n$\n(42,658)\n$\n510,733\n$\n280,994\nInterest expense\n55,659\n31,967\n185,838\n74,204\nIncome taxes\n1,855\n1,322\n6,678\n5,887\nDepreciation and amortization\n330,108\n285,246\n1,202,380\n1,093,473\nStock compensation expense\n12,477\n34,592\n59,634\n82,858\nGain on sales of real estate\n(101,806)\n(62,227)\n(129,312)\n(277,037)\nUnrealized losses (gains) on non-real estate \ninvestments\n79,776\n(19,479)\n112,246\n201,475\nImpairment of real estate\n186,564\n271,890\n223,068\n461,114\nImpairment of non-real estate investments\n20,266\n23,094\n58,090\n74,550\nProvision for expected credit losses on financial \ninstruments\n(434)\n—\n(434)\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n568,370\n$\n523,747\n$\n2,228,921\n$\n1,997,518\nTotal revenues\n$\n788,945\n$\n757,216\n$\n3,116,394\n$\n2,885,699\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n72%\n69%\n72%\n69%\nAnnual rental revenue\nAnnual rental revenue represents the annualized fixed base rental obligations, calculated in accordance with GAAP, including \nthe amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded and tenant-built landlord improvements, for leases in effect as of the end \nof the period, related to our operating RSF. Annual rental revenue is presented using 100% of the annual rental revenue from our \nconsolidated properties and our share of annual rental revenue for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. Annual rental revenue \nper RSF is computed by dividing annual rental revenue by the sum of 100% of the RSF of our consolidated properties and our share of \nthe RSF of properties held in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, approximately \n92%\n of our leases (on \nan annual rental revenue basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, \nutilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to \nbase rent. Annual rental revenue excludes these operating expenses recovered from our tenants. Amounts recovered from our tenants \nrelated to these operating expenses, along with base rent, are classified in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of \noperations.\nCapitalization rates\nCapitalization rates are calculated based on net operating income and net operating income (cash basis) annualized, \nexcluding lease termination fees, on stabilized operating assets for the quarter preceding the date on which the property is sold, or \nnear-term prospective net operating income.\nCapitalized interest\nWe capitalize interest cost as a cost of a project during periods for which activities necessary to develop, redevelop, or \nreposition a project for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has \nbeen incurred. Activities necessary to develop, redevelop, or reposition a project include pre-construction activities such as \nentitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building \nimprovements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective \ntenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of \n132\nbuildings. If we cease activities necessary to prepare a project for its intended use, interest costs related to such project are expensed \nas incurred.\nCash interest\nCash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP plus capitalized interest, less amortization of \nloan fees and debt premiums (discounts).\n Refer to “\nFixed-charge coverage ratio\n” in this section for a reconciliation of interest expense, \nthe most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to cash interest.\nClass A/A+ properties and AAA locations\nClass A/A+ properties are properties clustered in AAA locations that provide innovative tenants with highly dynamic and \ncollaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, \nefficiency, creativity, and success. These properties are typically well-located, professionally managed, and well-maintained, offering a \nwide range of amenities and featuring premium construction materials and finishes. Class A/A+ properties are generally newer or have \nundergone substantial redevelopment and are generally expected to command higher annual rental rates compared to other classes of \nsimilar properties. AAA locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related \nbusinesses. It is important to note that our definition of property classification may not be directly comparable to other equity REITs.\nDevelopment, redevelopment, and pre-construction\nA key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new \nClass A/A+ properties, as well as property enhancements identified during the underwriting of certain acquired properties. These efforts \nare primarily concentrated in collaborative Megacampus™ ecosystems within AAA life science innovation clusters, as well as other \nstrategic locations that support innovation and growth. These projects are generally focused on providing high-quality, generic, and \nreusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of a wide range of tenants. Upon completion, each development or \nredevelopment project is expected to generate increases in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development and \nredevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher \noccupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.\nDevelopment projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable laboratory facilities. \nRedevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of acquired office, warehouse, or shell space into laboratory space. \nWe generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new Class A/A+ laboratory space without \nfirst securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality Class A/A+ properties.\nPriority anticipated projects are those most likely to commence future ground-up development or first-time conversion from \nnon-laboratory space to laboratory space prior to our other future projects, pending market conditions and leasing negotiations.\nPre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of \nconstruction of aboveground building improvements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time \nrequired to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and \nare required for the vertical construction of buildings. Ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to \ngenerate significant revenue and cash flows.\nDevelopment, redevelopment, and pre-construction spending also includes the following costs: (i) amounts to bring certain \nacquired properties up to market standard and/or other costs identified during the acquisition process (generally within two years of \nacquisition) and (ii) permanent conversion of space for highly flexible, move-in-ready laboratory space to foster the growth of promising \nearly- and growth-stage life science companies.\nRevenue-enhancing and repositioning capital expenditures represent spending to reposition or significantly change the use of \na property, including through improvement in the asset quality from Class B to Class A/A+.\nNon-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures represent costs required to maintain the current revenues of a stabilized \nproperty, including the associated costs for renewed and re-leased space.\nDividend payout ratio (common stock)\nDividend payout ratio (common stock) is the ratio of the absolute dollar amount of dividends on our common stock (shares of \ncommon stock outstanding on the respective record dates multiplied by the related dividend per share) to funds from operations \nattributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted, as adjusted.\n133\nDividend yield\nDividend yield for the quarter represents the annualized quarter dividend divided by the closing common stock price at the end \nof the quarter.\nFixed-charge coverage ratio\nFixed-charge coverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure representing the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to cash interest and \nfixed charges. We believe that this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy fixed financing \nobligations and preferred stock dividends. Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP plus \ncapitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts).\nThe following table reconciles interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in \naccordance with GAAP, to cash interest and computes fixed-charge coverage ratio\n for the three months and years ended \nDecember 31, \n2024\n and \n2023\n (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n568,370\n$\n523,747\n$\n2,228,921\n$\n1,997,518\nInterest expense\n$\n55,659\n$\n31,967\n$\n185,838\n$\n74,204\nCapitalized interest\n81,586\n89,115\n330,961\n363,978\nAmortization of loan fees\n(4,620)\n(4,059)\n(17,130)\n(15,486)\nAmortization of debt discounts\n(333)\n(309)\n(1,309)\n(1,207)\nCash interest and fixed charges\n$\n132,292\n$\n116,714\n$\n498,360\n$\n421,489\nFixed-charge coverage ratio:\n– quarter annualized\n4.3x\n4.5x\nN/A\nN/A\n– trailing 12 months\nN/A\nN/A\n4.5x\n4.7x\nWe are not able to forecast the net income of future periods without unreasonable effort and therefore do not provide a \nreconciliation for fixed-charge coverage ratio on a forward-looking basis. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing \nand/or amount of items that depend on market conditions outside of our control, including the timing of dispositions, capital events, and \nfinancing decisions, as well as quarterly components such as gain on sales of real estate, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate \ninvestments, impairment of real estate, impairment of non-real estate investments, and provision for expected credit losses on financial \ninstruments. Our attempt to predict these amounts may produce significant but inaccurate estimates, which would be potentially \nmisleading for our investors.\nGross assets\nGross assets are calculated as total assets plus accumulated depreciation\n as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nTotal assets\n$\n37,527,449\n$\n36,771,402\nAccumulated depreciation\n5,625,179\n4,985,019\nGross assets\n$\n43,152,628\n$\n41,756,421\n134\nIncremental annual net operating income on development and redevelopment projects\nIncremental annual net operating income represents the amount of net operating income, on an annual basis, expected to be \nrealized upon a project being placed into service and achieving full occupancy. Incremental annual net operating income is calculated \nas the initial stabilized yield multiplied by the project’s total cost at completion.\nInitial stabilized yield (unlevered)\nInitial stabilized yield is calculated as the estimated amounts of net operating income at stabilization divided by our investment \nin the property. For this calculation, we exclude any tenant-funded and tenant-built landlord improvements from our investment in the \nproperty. Our initial stabilized yield excludes the benefit of leverage. Our cash rents related to our development and redevelopment \nprojects are generally expected to increase over time due to contractual annual rent escalations. Our estimates for initial stabilized \nyields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the \nproject. We expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner if there are significant changes to the expected \nproject yields or costs.\n•\nInitial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the \nterm(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis, and any amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-\nfunded and tenant-built landlord improvements.\n•\nInitial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have \nelapsed and our total cash investment in the property.\nInvestment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants\nInvestment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represent tenants that are investment-grade rated or publicly traded \ncompanies with an average daily market capitalization greater than $10 billion for the twelve months ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, as \nreported by Bloomberg Professional Services. Credit ratings from Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings reflect credit ratings of the \ntenant’s parent entity, and there can be no assurance that a tenant’s parent entity will satisfy the tenant’s lease obligation upon such \ntenant’s default. We monitor the credit quality and related material changes of our tenants. Material changes that cause a tenant’s \nmarket capitalization to decrease below $10 billion, which are not immediately reflected in the twelve-month average, may result in their \nexclusion from this measure.\nInvestments in real estate\nThe following table presents our new Class A/A+ development and redevelopment pipeline, excluding properties held for sale, \nas a percentage of gross assets and as a percentage of annual rental revenue as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n (dollars in thousands):\nPercentage of \nBook Value\nGross Assets\nAnnual Rental \nRevenue\nUnder construction projects\n$3,893,557\n9%\n—%\nIncome-producing/potential cash flows/covered land play\n(1)\n2,965,853\n7\n1\nLand\n1,759,317\n4\n—\n$8,618,727\n20%\n1%\n(1)\nIncludes projects with existing buildings that are generating or can generate operating cash flows.

We present the proportionate share of certain financial line items \nas follows: (i) for each real estate joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, which are controlled by us through \ncontractual rights or majority voting rights, but of which we own less than 100%, we apply the noncontrolling interest economic \nownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at the amount of such cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component \npresented; and (ii) for each real estate joint venture that we do not control and do not consolidate, and are instead controlled jointly or \nby our joint venture partners through contractual rights or majority voting rights, we apply our economic ownership percentage to each \nfinancial item to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented. \nThe components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures do not represent \nour legal claim to those items. For each entity that we do not wholly own, the joint venture agreement generally determines what equity \nholders can receive upon capital events, such as sales or refinancing, or in the event of a liquidation. Equity holders are normally \nentitled to their respective legal ownership of any residual cash from a joint venture only after all liabilities, priority distributions, and \nclaims have been repaid or satisfied.\nWe believe that this information can help investors estimate the balance sheet and operating results information related to our \npartially owned entities. Presenting this information provides a perspective not immediately available from consolidated financial \nstatements and one that can supplement an understanding of the joint venture assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in \nour consolidated results.\n136\nThe components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our real estate joint ventures are limited as an \nanalytical tool as the overall economic ownership interest does not represent our legal claim to each of our joint ventures’ assets, \nliabilities, or results of operations. In addition, joint venture financial information may include financial information related to the \nunconsolidated real estate joint ventures that we do not control. We believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding \nof our operating results and our total assets and liabilities, joint venture financial information should be examined in conjunction with our \nconsolidated statements of operations and balance sheets. Joint venture financial information should not be considered an alternative \nto our consolidated financial statements, which are presented and prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nMegacampus™\nA Megacampus ecosystem is a cluster campus that consist of approximately 1 million RSF or more, including operating, active \ndevelopment/redevelopment, and land RSF less operating RSF expected to be demolished. The following table reconciles our annual \nrental revenue and development and redevelopment pipeline RSF as of\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n (dollars in thousands):\nAnnual Rental \nRevenue\nDevelopment and \nRedevelopment \nPipeline RSF\nMegacampus\n$\n1,605,730\n20,130,433\nCore and non-core\n487,258\n9,392,253\nTotal\n$\n2,092,988\n29,522,686\nMegacampus as a percentage of annual rental revenue and of total development and \nredevelopment pipeline RSF\n77%\n68%\nNet cash provided by operating activities after dividends\nNet cash provided by operating activities after dividends includes the deduction for distributions to noncontrolling interests. For \npurposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences.\nNet debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA\nNet debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a \nsupplemental measure of evaluating our balance sheet leverage. Net debt and preferred stock is equal to the sum of total consolidated \ndebt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, plus preferred stock outstanding as of the end of the period.\n Refer to “\nAdjusted \nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin\n” in this section for further information on the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. \nWe are not able to forecast the net income of future periods without unreasonable effort and therefore do not provide a \nreconciliation for net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA on a forward-looking basis. This is due to the inherent difficulty of \nforecasting the timing and/or amount of items that depend on market conditions outside of our control, including the timing of \ndispositions, capital events, and financing decisions, as well as quarterly components such as gain on sales of real estate, unrealized \ngains or losses on non-real estate investments, impairment of real estate, impairment of non-real estate investments, and provision for \nexpected credit losses on financial instruments. Our attempt to predict these amounts may produce significant but inaccurate estimates, \nwhich would be potentially misleading for our investors.\n137\nThe following table reconciles debt to net debt and preferred stock and computes the ratio to Adjusted EBITDA as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n (dollars in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nSecured notes payable\n$\n149,909\n$\n119,662\nUnsecured senior notes payable\n12,094,465\n11,096,028\nUnsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper\n—\n99,952\nUnamortized deferred financing costs\n77,649\n76,329\nCash and cash equivalents\n(552,146)\n(618,190)\nRestricted cash\n(7,701)\n(42,581)\nPreferred stock\n—\n—\nNet debt and preferred stock\n$\n11,762,176\n$\n10,731,200\nAdjusted EBITDA:\n– quarter annualized\n$\n2,273,480\n$\n2,094,988\n– trailing 12 months\n$\n2,228,921\n$\n1,997,518\nNet debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA:\n– quarter annualized\n5.2x\n5.1x\n– trailing 12 months\n5.3x\n5.4x\nNet operating income, net operating income (cash basis), and operating margin\nThe following table reconciles net income to net operating income and net operating income (cash basis) and computes \noperating margin for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n2023\n, and \n2022\n (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n510,733\n$\n280,994\n$\n670,701\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures\n(7,059)\n(980)\n(645)\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n168,359\n199,354\n177,278\nInterest expense\n185,838\n74,204\n94,203\nDepreciation and amortization\n1,202,380\n1,093,473\n1,002,146\nImpairment of real estate\n223,068\n461,114\n64,969\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\n3,317\nGain on sales of real estate\n(129,312)\n(277,037)\n(537,918)\nInvestment loss\n53,122\n195,397\n331,758\nNet operating income\n2,207,129\n2,026,519\n1,805,809\nStraight-line rent revenue\n(143,329)\n(133,917)\n(118,003)\nAmortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded and -built \nlandlord improvements\n(1,543)\n—\n—\nAmortization of acquired below-market leases\n(85,679)\n(93,331)\n(74,346)\nProvision for expected credit losses on financial instruments\n(434)\n—\n—\nNet operating income (cash basis)\n$\n1,976,144\n$\n1,799,271\n$\n1,613,460\nNet operating income (from above)\n$\n2,207,129\n$\n2,026,519\n$\n1,805,809\nTotal revenues\n$\n3,116,394\n$\n2,885,699\n$\n2,588,962\nOperating margin\n71%\n70%\n70%\n138\nNet operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial \nmeasure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, excluding equity in the earnings of our unconsolidated real estate joint \nventures, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments of real estate, gains or \nlosses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and investment income or loss. We believe net operating \nincome provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects \nthose income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure \nfor investors to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated real estate assets. Net operating income on a cash basis is net \noperating income adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent, amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease revenue, \namortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded and tenant-built landlord improvements, and provision for expected credit \nlosses on financial instruments adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to \ninvestors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent revenue and the amortization of \nacquired above- and below-market leases and tenant-funded and tenant-built landlord improvements.\nFurthermore, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure of our consolidated properties \nbecause, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, \nwhich provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. Net operating income can be used to measure the initial \nstabilized yields of our properties by calculating net operating income generated by a property divided by our investment in the property. \nNet operating income excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to the \nresults of operations of our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real \nestate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, \nbecause of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of operating performance at the property level. \nImpairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairments of real estate \nto be property-level operating expenses. Impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the \ncurrent operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. Our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in \nthe value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. These impairments result from investing decisions or a deterioration \nin market conditions. We also exclude realized and unrealized investment gain or loss, which results from investment decisions that \noccur at the corporate level related to non-real estate investments in publicly traded companies and certain privately held entities. \nTherefore, we do not consider these activities to be an indication of operating performance of our real estate assets at the property \nlevel. Our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as \nlosses on early extinguishment of debt and provision for expected credit losses on financial instruments, as these charges often relate \nto corporate strategy. Property operating expenses included in determining net operating income primarily consist of costs that are \nrelated to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted \nservices, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. General and \nadministrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, rent, and \nsupplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. We calculate operating margin as net operating income divided by \ntotal revenues.\nWe believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should \nbe examined in conjunction with net income or loss as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. Net operating income \nshould not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows \nas a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions.\nOperating statistics\nWe present certain operating statistics related to our properties, including number of properties, RSF, occupancy percentage, \nleasing activity, and contractual lease expirations as of the end of the period. We believe these measures are useful to investors \nbecause they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. We compute the number of properties, RSF, occupancy \npercentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations at 100%, excluding RSF at properties classified as held for sale, for all \nproperties in which we have an investment, including properties owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint \nventures.\n For operating metrics based on annual rental revenue, refer to “\nAnnual rental revenue\n” in this section. \n139\nSame property comparisons\nAs a result of changes within our total property portfolio during the comparative periods presented, including changes from \nassets acquired or sold, properties placed into development or redevelopment, and development or redevelopment properties recently \nplaced into service, the consolidated total income from rentals, as well as rental operating expenses in our operating results, can show \nsignificant changes from period to period. In order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given quarterly or \nannual period, we analyze the operating performance for all consolidated properties that were fully operating for the entirety of the \ncomparative periods presented, referred to as same properties. We separately present quarterly and year-to-date same property results \nto align with the interim financial information required by the SEC in our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial \ncondition and results of operations. These same properties are analyzed separately from properties acquired subsequent to the first day \nin the earliest comparable quarterly or year-to-date period presented, properties that underwent development or redevelopment at any \ntime during the comparative periods, unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, properties classified as held for sale, and corporate \nentities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results. Additionally, \ntermination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of same properties.\n Refer to “\nSame properties\n” in Item 7 in this annual report on \nForm 10-K for additional information. \nStabilized occupancy date\nThe stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which the project is expected to reach occupancy of 95% or \ngreater.\nTenant recoveries\nTenant recoveries represent revenues comprising reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and \nmaintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses and earned in the period during which the applicable expenses \nare incurred and the tenant’s obligation to reimburse us arises.\nWe classify rental revenues and tenant recoveries generated through the leasing of real estate assets within revenues in \nincome from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations.\n We provide investors with a separate presentation of rental revenues \nand tenant recoveries in “\nResults of operations\n” in Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K because we believe it promotes investors’ \nunderstanding of our operating results. \nWe believe that the presentation of tenant recoveries is useful to investors as a supplemental \nmeasure of our ability to recover operating expenses under our triple net leases, including recoveries of utilities, repairs and \nmaintenance, insurance, property taxes, common area expenses, and other operating expenses, and of our ability to mitigate the effect \nto net income for any significant variability to components of our operating expenses.\nThe following table reconciles income from rentals to tenant recoveries for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n2023\n, and \n2022\n (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome from rentals\n$\n3,049,706\n$\n2,842,456\n$\n2,576,040\nRental revenues\n(2,304,339)\n(2,143,971)\n(1,950,098)\nTenant recoveries\n$\n745,367\n$\n698,485\n$\n625,942\nTotal equity capitalization\nTotal equity capitalization is equal to the outstanding shares of common stock multiplied by the closing price on the last trading\n \nday at the end of each period presented.\nTotal market capitalization\nTotal market capitalization is equal to the sum of total equity capitalization and total debt.\nUnencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income\nUnencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we \nbelieve is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets as it \nreflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. Unencumbered net operating income is \nderived from assets classified in continuing operations, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security \ninterest, as of the period for which income is presented.\n140\nThe following table summarizes unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income for the \nyears ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \n2023\n, and \n2022\n (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUnencumbered net operating income\n$\n2,192,608\n$\n2,022,177\n$\n1,790,033\nEncumbered net operating income\n14,521\n4,342\n15,776\nTotal net operating income\n$\n2,207,129\n$\n2,026,519\n$\n1,805,809\nUnencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total \nnet operating income\n99.3%\n99.8%\n99.1%\nWeighted-average shares of common stock outstanding – diluted\nFrom time to time, we enter into capital market transactions, including forward equity sales agreements (“Forward \nAgreements”), to fund acquisitions, to fund construction of our development and redevelopment projects, and for general working \ncapital purposes.
