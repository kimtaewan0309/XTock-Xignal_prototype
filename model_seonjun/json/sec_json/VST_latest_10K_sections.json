See \nGlossary of Terms and Abbreviations\n for defined terms.\nGeneral\nVistra is an integrated retail electricity and power generation company. We combine an innovative, customer-centric approach to retail sales with safe, reliable, diverse, and efficient power generation. Our integrated power generation and wholesale operation allows us to efficiently obtain the electricity needed to serve our customers at the lowest cost. The integrated model enables us to structure products and contracts in a way that offers significant value compared to stand-alone retail electric providers.\nThe Company brings its products and services to market in 18 states and the District of Columbia, including all major competitive wholesale power markets in the U.S. We serve approximately 5 million residential, commercial, and industrial retail customers with electricity and natural gas. Our generation fleet totals approximately 41,000 megawatts of generation capacity powered by a diverse portfolio, including natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage facilities.\nMarket Discussion\nThe operations of Vistra, as an integrated retail electricity and power generation company, are further aligned into five reportable business segments: (i) Retail, (ii) Texas, (iii) East, (iv) West, and (v) Asset Closure. Our Texas, East, and West segments include our electricity generation operations, and our Asset Closure segment is engaged in the decommissioning and reclamation of retired plants and mines. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we updated our reportable segments to reflect changes in how the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) makes operating decisions, assesses performance, and allocates resources by eliminating the Sunset segment. The results of the plants previously included in the Sunset segment are now reflected in the Texas and East segments based on their respective geography.\nRetail Operations\nVistra is one of the largest competitive residential retail electricity providers in the U.S. Our retail operations are engaged in retail sales of electricity, natural gas, and related services to approximately 5 million customers. Substantially all of our retail activities are conducted by TXU Energy, Ambit Energy, Dynegy Energy Services, Homefield Energy, and U.S. Gas & Electric across 16 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The largest portion of our retail operations are in Texas, where we provide retail electricity to approximately 2.6 million customers.\nOur TXU Energy brand, which has been used to sell electricity to customers in the competitive retail electricity market in Texas for over 20 years, is registered and protected by trademark law. We also own the trade names for Ambit Energy, Dynegy Energy Services, Homefield Energy, TriEagle Energy, Public Power, and U.S. Gas & Electric.\nWe believe that we have differentiated ourselves by providing a distinctive customer experience predicated on delivering reliable and innovative power products and solutions to our customers, including 100% wind and solar options, as well as thermostats, dashboards, and other programs designed to encourage reduced electricity consumption and increased energy efficiency. Our distinctive power products give our customers choice, convenience, and control over how and when they use electricity and related services.\n1\nTable of Contents\nElectricity Generation Operations\nVistra is the largest competitive power generator in the U.S. as measured by MWh of generation capacity. At December 31, 2024, our generating capacity was powered by the following:\nPrimary Fuel\nTechnology\nNet Capacity (MW)\n% of Net Capacity\nNatural Gas\nCCGT, CT or ST\n24,120 \n59%\nCoal\nST\n8,428 \n21%\nUranium\nNuclear\n6,448 \n16%\nRenewable\nSolar/Battery\n1,474 \n4%\nFuel Oil\nCT\n187 \n—%\nTotal\n40,657 \n100%\nOur natural gas-fueled generation fleet is comprised of 23 CCGT generation facilities totaling 19,742 MW and 10 peaking generation facilities totaling 4,378 MW. We satisfy our fuel requirements at these facilities through a combination of spot market and near-term purchase contracts. Additionally, we have near-term natural gas transportation agreements and natural gas storage agreements in place to ensure fleet reliability.\nOur coal/lignite-fueled generation fleet is comprised of seven generation facilities totaling 8,428 MW of generation capacity. We meet our fuel requirements at our coal-fueled generation facilities in PJM and MISO with coal purchased from multiple suppliers under contracts of various lengths and transported to the facilities by either railcar or barges. We meet our fuel requirements in ERCOT using lignite that we mine at our generation facilities and coal purchased and transported by railcar.\nWe own and operate six nuclear generation units at four different facilities:\nUnit\nISO\nNet Capacity (MW)\nRefueling Outage Frequency\nLicense Expiration Date\nComanche Peak Unit 1\nERCOT\n1,200 \n18 Months\n2050\nComanche Peak Unit 2\nERCOT\n1,200 \n18 Months\n2053\nBeaver Valley Unit 1\nPJM\n939 \n18 Months\n2036\nBeaver Valley Unit 2\nPJM\n933 \n18 Months\n2047\nPerry\nPJM\n1,268 \n24 Months\n2026 (a)\nDavis-Besse\nPJM\n908 \n24 Months\n2037\nTotal\n6,448 \n___________\n(a)\nIn 2023, an application for a license renewal at our Perry nuclear plant was filed with the NRC to extend our license through 2046.\nNuclear units are generally operated at full capacity. Refueling (nuclear fuel assembly replacement) outages for each unit are scheduled to occur during the spring or fall off-peak demand periods. While one unit is undergoing a refueling outage at dual-unit facilities, the remaining unit is intended to operate at full capacity. During a refueling outage, other maintenance, modification, and testing activities are completed that cannot be accomplished when the unit is in operation.\nWe have contracts in place for all of our nuclear fuel requirements through 2029. We do not anticipate any significant difficulties in acquiring uranium and contracting for associated conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services in the foreseeable future. We continue to monitor developments regarding the availability of nuclear fuel that may arise out of the Russia and Ukraine conflict. See Item 7. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, and Results of Operations – Significant Activities and Events, and Items Influencing Future Performance\n \n– Macroeconomic Conditions\n.\nOur generation operations by segment are represented in the following table:\nSegment\nNet Capacity (MW)\n% of Net Capacity\nISO/RTO\nTexas\n19,031 \n47%\nERCOT\nEast\n19,746 \n49%\nPJM, ISO-NE, MISO, and NYISO\nWest\n1,880 \n4%\nCAISO\nTotal\n40,657 \n100%\n2\nTable of Contents\nIndependent System Operators (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs)\n — ISOs and RTOs manage the transmission infrastructure and markets across regions, separate from our operations. They dispatch generation facilities, ensuring efficient and reliable transmission system operation. ISOs/RTOs administer short-term energy and ancillary service markets, typically day-ahead and real-time, and some also manage long-term planning reserves through various capacity markets. They impose bid and price limits in wholesale power markets.  NERC regions and ISOs/RTOs often have different geographic footprints, and while there may be geographic overlap between NERC regions and ISOs/RTOs, their respective roles and responsibilities do not generally overlap.\nIn centrally dispatched market structures (e.g., ERCOT, PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO, MISO, CAISO), all generators receive the same price for energy based on the bid price of the last MWh needed to balance supply and demand. Prices vary within different zones due to transmission losses and congestion. For example, if a less efficient natural gas unit is needed to meet demand, its offer price sets the market clearing price for all dispatched generation in that market, regardless of other units' offer prices. Generators receive the location-based marginal price for their output.\nERCOT\n — ERCOT is an ISO that manages the flow of electricity from approximately 103,600 MW of expected Summer 2024 peak generation capacity to approximately 27 million Texas customers, representing approximately 90% of the state's electric load.\nAs an energy-only market, ERCOT's market design is distinct from other competitive electricity markets in the U.S. Other markets maintain a minimum planning reserve margin through regulated planning, resource adequacy requirements and/or capacity markets. In contrast, ERCOT's resource adequacy is currently predominately dependent on energy-market price signals. The Texas Legislature mandated the development of an ancillary service, the Dispatchable Reliability Reserve Service (DRRS), to address intra-hour operations challenges. The PUCT voted in December 2024 to have ERCOT develop DRRS so it can address both operational issues and resource adequacy issues. ERCOT is continuing work on DRRS, and it has not been implemented as of the date hereof. In 2014, ERCOT implemented the Operating Reserve Demand Curve (ORDC), pursuant to which wholesale electricity prices in the real-time electricity market increase automatically as available operating reserves decrease below defined threshold levels, creating a price adder. The slope of the ORDC curve is determined through a mathematical loss of load probability calculation using forecasted reserves and historical data. In both March 2019 and March 2020, ERCOT implemented 0.25 standard deviation shifts in the loss of load probability calculation and moved to using a single blended ORDC curve; these changes resulted in a more rapid escalation in power prices as operating reserves fall below defined thresholds. Effective January 1, 2022, when operating reserves drop to 3,000 MW or less, the ORDC automatically adjusts power prices to $5,000/MWh which is equal to the high system-wide offer cap. When ERCOT implements real-time co-optimization, discussed below, the ORDC will be replaced by ancillary service demand curves that are designed to mimic the operation of the ORDC. ERCOT also calculates the \"peaker net margin\" based on revenues a hypothetical unhedged peaking unit would collect in the market. If the peaker net margin exceeds a certain threshold, the system-wide offer cap is reduced to the low system-wide offer cap of $2,000/MWh for the remainder of the calendar year. In December 2023, the PUCT also approved an Emergency Pricing Program that temporarily lowers the system-wide offer cap to $2,000/MWh if prices have been at the cap for 12 hours in a rolling 24-hour period. Historically, high demand due to elevated temperatures in the summer months or high demand due to reduced temperatures in the winter months, combined with underperformance of wind generation, has created the conditions during which the ORDC contributes meaningfully to power prices. Extreme weather conditions can also lead to scarcity conditions regardless of season. Other than during periods of \"scarcity pricing,\" the price of power is typically set by natural gas-fueled generation facilities (see Item 7. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, and Results of Operations – Significant Activities and Events, and Items Influencing Future Performance\n).\n3\nTable of Contents\nTransactions in ERCOT take place in two key markets: the day-ahead market and the real-time market. The day-ahead market is a voluntary, financial electricity market conducted the day before each operating day in which generators and purchasers of electricity may bid for one or more hours of electricity supply or consumption. The real-time market is a physical market in which electricity is dispatched and priced in five-minute intervals. The day-ahead market provides market participants with visibility into where prices are expected to clear, and the prices are not impacted by subsequent events. Conversely, the real-time market exposes purchasers to the risk of transient operational events and price spikes. These two markets allow market participants to manage their risk profile by adjusting their participation in each market. In addition, ERCOT uses ancillary services to maintain system reliability, including regulation service, responsive reserve service, and non-spinning reserve service. Ancillary services are provided by generators and qualified loads to help maintain the stable voltage and frequency requirements of the transmission system. ERCOT currently procures ancillary services in the day-ahead market, but plans to implement co-optimization of energy and ancillary services in the real-time market by the end of 2025. Because ERCOT has one of the highest concentrations of wind and solar capacity generation among U.S. markets, the ERCOT market is more susceptible to fluctuations in wholesale electricity supply due to intermittent wind and solar production, making ERCOT more vulnerable to periods of generation scarcity. ERCOT implemented the ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS) in June 2023 to further address the need for operating reserves to manage load and intermittent resource output uncertainty.\nPJM\n — PJM is an RTO that manages the flow of electricity from approximately 183,000 MW of generation capacity to approximately 65 million customers in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.\nLike ERCOT, PJM administers markets for wholesale electricity and provides transmission planning for the region, utilizing a locational marginal pricing (LMP) methodology which calculates a price for every generator and load point within PJM. PJM operates day-ahead and real-time markets into which generators can bid to provide energy and ancillary services. PJM also administers a forward capacity auction, the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM), which establishes a long-term market for capacity. We have participated in RPM auctions for years up to and including PJM's planning year 2025-2026, which ends May 31, 2026. PJM's RPM auction for planning year 2026-2027 was delayed and is expected to be run in July 2025. We also enter into bilateral capacity transactions. PJM's Capacity Performance (CP) rules were designed to improve system reliability and include penalties for under-performing units and reward for over-performing units during shortage events. Full transition of the capacity market to CP rules occurred in planning year 2020-2021. An independent market monitor continually monitors PJM markets to ensure a robust, competitive market and to identify improper behavior by any entity.\nISO-NE\n — ISO-NE is an ISO that manages the flow of electricity from approximately 30,600 MW of winter generation capacity to approximately 15 million customers in the states of Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Maine.\nISO-NE dispatches power plants to meet system energy and reliability needs and settles physical power deliveries at LMPs. Its energy markets allow market participants to buy and sell energy and ancillary services at prices established through real-time and day-ahead auctions. Energy prices vary among the locations in ISO-NE and are largely influenced by transmission constraints and fuel supply. ISO-NE offers the Forward Capacity Market where capacity prices are determined through auctions currently run three years prior to the capacity delivery year. ISO-NE is working with stakeholders to transition to a prompt capacity market for the delivery year starting in June 2028. Performance incentive rules have the potential to increase capacity payments for those resources that are providing excess energy or reserves during a shortage event, while penalizing those that produce less than the required level.\nNYISO\n — NYISO is an ISO that manages the flow of electricity from approximately 37,100 MW of installed summer generation capacity to approximately 20 million New York customers.\nNYISO dispatches power plants to meet system energy and reliability needs and settles physical power deliveries at LMPs. Its energy markets allow market participants to buy and sell energy and ancillary services at prices established through real-time and day-ahead auctions. Energy prices vary among the regional zones and locations in the NYISO and are largely influenced by transmission constraints and fuel supply. NYISO offers the Installed Capacity Market, a forward capacity market where capacity prices are determined through auctions. Strip auctions occur one to two months prior to the commencement of a six-month seasonal planning period. Subsequent auctions provide an opportunity to sell excess capacity for the balance of the seasonal planning period or the upcoming month. Due to the short-term nature of the NYISO-operated capacity auctions and a relatively liquid bilateral market for NYISO capacity products, our Independence facility sells a significant portion of its capacity through bilateral transactions. The balance is cleared through the seasonal and monthly capacity auctions.\n4\nTable of Contents\nMISO\n — MISO is an RTO that manages the flow of electricity from approximately 202,000 MW of installed generation capacity to approximately 45 million customers in all or parts of Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, and Manitoba, Canada.\nMISO dispatches power plants to meet system energy and reliability needs and settles physical power deliveries at LMPs. Its energy markets allow market participants to buy and sell energy and ancillary services at prices established through real-time and day-ahead auctions. Energy prices vary among the regional zones and locations in MISO and are largely influenced by transmission constraints and fuel supply. An independent market monitor is responsible for evaluating the performance of the markets and identifying conduct by market participants or MISO that may compromise the efficiency or distort the outcome of the markets.\nMISO administers a one-year Planning Resource Auction (PRA) for the next planning year from June 1st of the current year to May 31st of the following year. MISO's PRA currently uses a vertical demand curve that can result in more volatile capacity prices. In 2022, FERC approved MISO's proposal to change the annual Planning Resource Auction into a seasonal auction, effective for the 2023-2024 planning year. Starting with the PRA for the 2025-2026 planning year, MISO will begin using a sloped demand curve. We participate in these auctions with open capacity that has not been committed through bilateral or retail transactions. We also participate in the MISO annual and monthly financial transmission rights auctions to manage the cost of our transmission congestion, as measured by the congestion component of the LMP price differential between two points on the transmission grid across the market area.\nCAISO\n \n— CAISO is an ISO that manages the flow of electricity to approximately 32 million customers primarily in California, representing approximately 80% percent of the state's electric load.\nEnergy is priced in CAISO utilizing an LMP methodology. The capacity market is comprised of Generic, Flexible, and Local Resource Adequacy (RA) Capacity, which is administered by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). Unlike other centrally cleared capacity markets, the resource adequacy markets in California are primarily bilaterally traded markets. In 2020, the CPUC introduced a central procurement entity for Local RA Capacity effective for the 2023 compliance year. The central procurement entity runs a pay-as-bid auction for Local RA Capacity. In November 2016, CAISO implemented a voluntary capacity auction for annual, monthly, and intra-month procurement to cover for deficiencies in the market. The voluntary Competitive Solicitation Process, which FERC approved in October 2015, is a modification to the Capacity Procurement Mechanism (CPM) and provides another avenue to sell RA capacity.\nWholesale Operations\n — Our wholesale commodity risk management group is responsible for dispatching our generation fleet in response to market needs after implementing portfolio optimization strategies, thus linking and integrating the generation fleet production with our retail customer and wholesale sales opportunities. Market demand, also known as load, faced by electric power systems, such as those we operate in, varies from moment to moment as a result of changes in business and residential demand, which is often driven by weather. Unlike most other commodities, the production and consumption of electricity must remain balanced on an instantaneous basis. There is a certain baseline demand for electricity across an electric power system that occurs throughout the day, which is typically satisfied by baseload generation units with low variable operating costs. Baseload generation units can also increase output to satisfy certain incremental demand and reduce output when demand is unusually low. Intermediate/load-following generation units, which can more efficiently change their output to satisfy increases in demand, typically satisfy a large proportion of changes in intraday load as they respond to daily increases in demand or unexpected changes in supply created by reduced generation from renewable resources or other generator outages. Peak daily loads may be satisfied by peaking units. Peaking units are typically the most expensive to operate, but they can quickly start up and shut down to meet brief peaks in demand. In general, baseload units, intermediate/load following units, and peaking units are dispatched into the ISO/RTO grid in order from lowest to highest variable cost. Price formation is typically based on the highest variable cost unit that clears the market to satisfy system demand at a given point in time.\nOur commodity risk management group enters into electricity, natural gas, and other commodity derivative contracts to reduce exposure to price fluctuations with the goal of reducing volatility of future revenues and fuel costs for our generation facilities and purchased power costs for our Retail segment.\n5\nTable of Contents\nSeasonality\nThe demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. As a result, our operating results are impacted by extreme or sustained weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal basis. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and winter seasons, when the temperatures are more extreme, and the demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter. More severe weather conditions such as heat waves or extreme winter weather have made, and may make, such fluctuations more pronounced. The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on, among other things, the retail load served and the terms of contracts to purchase or sell electricity.\nCompetition\nCompetition in the markets in which we operate is impacted by electricity and fuel prices, congestion along the power grid, subsidies provided by state and federal governments for new and existing generation facilities, including renewables generation and battery ESS, new market entrants, construction of new generation assets, technological advances in power generation, the actions of environmental and other regulatory authorities, and other factors. We primarily compete with other electricity generators and retailers based on our ability to generate electric supply, market and sell electricity at competitive prices, and efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities to deliver electricity to end-users. Competitors in the generation and retail power markets in which we participate include numerous regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators, competitive subsidiaries of regulated utilities, independent power producers, REPs, and other energy marketers. See Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n for additional information concerning the risks faced with respect to the markets in which we operate.\nBusiness Strategy\nVistra is the largest producer of power in deregulated markets in the U.S. with annual expected generation of over 200 TWh as of December 31, 2024.\nVistra is guided by four core principles:\n•\nWe do business the right way. \nEvery decision we make and action we take will be evidence of the utmost integrity and compliance.\n•\nWe compete to win. \nWe will create the leading integrated energy company with an unmatched work ethic, an analysis-driven and disciplined culture with strong leadership and decision-making throughout the organization.\n•\nWe work as a team. \nWe are committed to each other, everything we do and to the success of our company.\n•\nWe care about our key stakeholders. \nWe respect our fellow employees, we focus on our customers, and we care about our communities where we live and do business. We will maintain productive and respectful relationship with our legislators, regulators and community leaders.\nTo align with our four core principles, our focus is on the execution of our strategic priorities as follows:\nLong-term, attractive earnings profile through the integrated business model. \nOur integrated business model distinguishes us from our electricity competitors as it combines our reliable and efficient diversified generation fleet totaling approximately 41,000 MW of capacity, with our commercial operations, including commodity risk management capabilities, and our best-in-class retail energy platform. We believe integrating retail with power generation stands as a fundamental competitive advantage that mitigates the impact of commodity price fluctuations and enhances the stability and predictability of our cash flows.\nDisciplined capital allocation. \nWe strive to make thoughtful decisions when allocating our free cash flow to balance growth opportunities with returning capital to our stakeholders through share repurchases, dividends, and debt reduction. \nMaintaining a resilient balance sheet. \nWe seek to manage our financial leverage by maintaining a strong balance sheet which ensures our access to diverse sources of liquidity. We believe this provides financial flexibility for our capital allocation decisions, including executing on organic growth opportunities, engaging in mergers and acquisitions, opportunistic debt reduction, or returning capital to our stockholders.\n6\nTable of Contents\nStrategic energy transition that supports the reliability, affordability, and sustainability of the electric grid. \nAs one of the largest electricity generators in the U.S., Vistra has led the way in decarbonization efforts and is committed to sustainability, setting aggressive targets, and transitioning our fleet to low-to-no carbon resources, all while balancing our obligations to our stakeholders. While the way we generate electricity may be changing, our essential role in providing reliable and affordable electricity is not.\nHuman Capital Resources\nVistra's approach to human capital management is guided by our core values. Our core values apply to all employees, suppliers and contractors and guide how we interact with our partner companies, communities, the environment and all other stakeholders. We aim to conduct all aspects of our business in accordance with these core values, which serve as the cultural foundation of the Company.\nVistra believes our most valuable asset is our talented, dedicated and dynamic group of employees who work together to achieve our objectives, and our top priority is ensuring their safety. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 6,850 full-time employees, including approximately 1,940 employees under collective bargaining agreements.\nSafety\nVistra's mindset around safety is exemplified by our motto: \nBest Defense. Everyone wins. No one gets hurt. \nOur safety culture revolves around people and human performance. We place a high importance on continuous improvement, along with a keen focus on numerous learning and error-prevention tools. To facilitate a learning environment, our various operating plants share their investigations and learnings of all safety events with all operations employees on weekly calls. The information is presented by front-line employees and supported by management. The lessons from each event are shared across the fleet to prevent similar incidents at other locations. All personnel at Vistra locations are encouraged to be actively involved in the safety process. Managers are required to participate in safety engagements with staff to enable constant communication and sustained interaction. In 2024, the generation fleet conducted more than 51,000 leadership safety engagements across the fleet continuing our employee driven safety program focused on engagement of all employees.\nOur focus on reducing the severity of injuries for both our employees and contractors who work with us has shown positive results. Since the implementation of our Best Defense safety program, the number of serious injuries or fatalities has decreased significantly. Although we do not focus on recordable incidents, our Total Recordable Incident rate (TRIR) for company employees was 0.72, in the top quartile as compared to the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) 2023 Total Company Injury Data for companies of comparable size. We encourage near-miss reporting and review of events to promote a learning environment. In 2024, safety learning calls were held every week where near-miss and safety events were reviewed by our operating teams to promote learning across the fleet.\nAll Vistra employees are covered by our safety program. Corporate and retail employees are required to complete periodic training on safety topics through our online learning management system. Employees who are located at a power plant are required to complete trainings based on job function, which is also tracked through our central learning management system. In addition, the Company engages an independent third-party conformity assessment and certification vendor to manage adherence to our safety standards for all vendors and contractors who work at our plants. In addition, we work closely with our suppliers and contractors to ensure our safety practices are upheld.\nAll of our power plant facilities have effective health and safety programs and comply with OSHA regulations. In addition to compliance, our generation fleet has a total of 14 plants that have been awarded the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star designation by the OSHA for superior demonstration of effective safety and health management systems and for maintaining injury and illness rates below the national averages for our industry. Our Casco Bay, Forney, Lamar, and Liberty generation facilities completed reevaluations and were recommended to continue as VPP Star in 2024. VPP Star status is the highest designation of OSHA's Voluntary Protection Programs. The achievement recognizes employers and workers who have implemented effective safety and health management systems and maintain injury and illness rates below national Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) averages for their respective industries. These sites are self-sufficient in their ability to control workplace hazards and are reevaluated every three to five years. Additionally, 32 of our power plants and mine locations have adopted a proactive Behavior Based Safety approach to safety which focuses on identifying and providing feedback on at-risk behaviors observed.\n7\nTable of Contents\nOur People\nWe recognize the value of having an inclusive workforce. Our employees reflect the communities we serve, ranging in age, gender, ethnicity, physical appearance, thoughts, styles, religions, nationality, education and numerous other traits. Creating and maintaining an environment where our employees feel appreciated for their talent and contribution enhances our ability to recruit and retain the best talent in the marketplace and to provide a work environment that allows all employees to continue to be their best.\nVistra is active in our communities through employee-led initiatives, business teams, and collaborations with many community agencies, such as United Way. Another way we engage with our communities is through our supply chain initiative, which seeks to create a dynamic supply chain that identifies suppliers of all sizes and across our markets that are able to provide quality products and services to the business.\nTraining and Development\nWe believe the development of employees at all levels is critical to Vistra's current and future success. We have launched key programs to develop leaders at all levels of the organization. Vistra's Essentials of Leadership provides new managers with skills to lead organizations in situational leadership, business acumen, and exposes them to best practices from across the company. We continue to evaluate and refine our programs as the development needs of our employees change. In 2024, Vistra began including the former Energy Harbor employees and leaders in leadership and front-line training programs to accelerate the integration of Vistra's culture with the new nuclear sites.\nVistra also provides many other training and development programs to help grow and develop employees at every level, including online learning platform courses, learning management system courses, recorded webinars and presentations, self-paced development and employee-specific skill training. The Vistra Learning Community is our online platform that strategically supports employees in completing thousands of hours of professional training to support continuing education requirements for their respective professional licenses, including accounting, legal and nuclear. In 2024, Vistra continued its formal mentoring program available to all employees to focus on topics like organizational knowledge, career development, individual development, collaboration and leadership. Over 450 employees participated in 2024. In 2024, Vistra launched physical and online Career Hubs, where employees can go to learn about a wide variety of careers within the company and identify skills they need to develop to pursue those roles. In addition, all full-time employees, other than those in a collective bargaining unit, receive a formal performance review guiding development and improving results of the business.\nEmployee Benefits\nMaintaining attractive benefits and pay are important for recruiting and retaining talent. We are committed to maintaining an equitable compensation structure, including performing annual salary reviews by employee category level within significant locations of operations. Eligible full- and part-time employees are provided access to medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, long-term disability coverage, accident coverage, critical illness coverage and hospital indemnity coverage. Regular full-time employees are eligible for short-term disability benefits, and all employees are eligible for the employee assistance program, parental leave, maternity leave and a 401(k) plan through which the Company matches employee contributions up to 6%.\nWellness\nWe believe a healthy workforce leads to greater well-being at work and at home. To help keep our workforce healthy, we offer access to on-site medical clinics at six locations. Our healthcare plans are also designed to reward employees for getting annual physicals, age and gender health screenings and immunizations. In addition, our employee medical plans promote mental health and emotional wellness and offer resources for employees seeking assistance. Fitness centers in multiple facilities offer cardio equipment, a selection of free weights and exercise mats. Our employee-led wellness team engages our people to get active and support causes that promote healthy living. With support from the company, the wellness team covers the registration costs for employees to participate in running and cycling events throughout the year.\n8\nTable of Contents\nEnvironmental Regulations and Related Considerations\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation by governmental authorities, including the EPA and the environmental regulatory bodies of states in which we operate. The EPA has finalized or proposed several regulatory actions establishing new requirements for control of certain emissions from sources, including electricity generation facilities. However, in January 2025, President Trump issued a series of executive orders, including an order titled Unleashing American Energy (the Order) that ordered that all federal agencies are to review all existing regulations, orders, and other actions for consistency with the policy goals, and develop an action plan within 30 days to resolve any policy inconsistencies. The Order requires the EPA to review the GHG, CSAPR, Legacy CCR and ELG rules discussed below. Additionally, the Order states the U.S. Attorney General may request a stay of the litigation involving these rules while the EPA conducts its reviews. See Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n and Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nClimate Change\nThere is continuing interest from our stakeholders domestically and internationally on global climate change and how GHG emissions, such as CO\n2\n, contribute to global climate change. GHG emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, primarily by our coal-fueled-generation plants as well as our natural gas-fueled generation plants represent the substantial majority of our total GHG emissions. CO\n2\n, methane and nitrous oxide are emitted in this combustion process, with CO\n2\n representing the largest portion of these GHG emissions. We estimate that our generation facilities produced approximately 95 million short tons of CO\n2\n in the year ended 2024. Vistra's carbon intensity for power generation improved from 0.56 short tons of CO\n2\n per MWh in 2023 to 0.48 short tons of CO\n2\n per MWh in 2024, a 15% year-over-year improvement driven by our Energy Harbor acquisition.\nTo manage our environmental impact from our business activities and reduce our emissions profile, Vistra set emissions reduction targets. Vistra is targeting to achieve a 60% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO\n2\n equivalent emissions by 2030 as compared to a 2010 baseline with a long-term goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, assuming necessary advancements in technology and supportive market constructs and public policy. Since 2010, Vistra has retired more than 15,100 MW of coal and natural gas power plants resulting in a 50% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) emissions, a 66% reduction in nitrogen oxide (NO\nX\n) emissions, and an 90% reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO\n2\n) emissions through year-end 2024, compared to a 2010 baseline. Vistra also has targets validated through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Our near-term science-based targets are to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 58% by 2028 from a 2018 base year, reduce absolute scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions from all sold electricity 58% within the same timeframe, and reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from use of sold products 42% within the same timeframe. Vistra is exploring multiple options to meet these targets, but we must balance these efforts with the need to prioritize reliability and affordability for our customers.\nThe evolution of our generation portfolio is focused on ensuring reliability and affordability in the markets we serve with an emphasis on resilient dispatchable assets complemented by zero-carbon assets. We seek to serve our customers through a variety of generation sources, including efficient natural gas units, nuclear generation, renewables, and battery ESS, while we also continuously explore new technologies with lower carbon footprints.\nWe have already taken or announced significant steps to transform our generation portfolio with the goal of maintaining reliability while also reducing the emissions intensity of our generation fleet, including:\n•\nAcquisition of Nuclear Generation Facilities \n— In 2024, we acquired 4,048 MW of nuclear generation facilities in PJM from Energy Harbor.\n•\nRe-powered generation assets \n— In May 2024, we announced our intention to repower the coal-fueled Coleto Creek Power Plant near Goliad, Texas as a natural-gas fueled plant with up to 600 MW of capacity.\n•\nUprated capacity at existing natural gas plants \n— Additional capacity has been added to existing natural gas plants through technological upgrades improving efficiency and overall fleet intensity.\n•\nBattery Energy Storage Projects\n — As of December 31, 2024, we owned battery ESS totaling 750 MW in California, 270 MW in Texas and 4 MW in Illinois. We have announced our plans to develop additional battery ESS at retired or to-be-retired plant sites in Illinois.\n•\nSolar Projects\n — As of December 31, 2024, we owned solar generations facilities totaling 338 MW in Texas and 112 MW in Illinois. We have announced our plans to develop additional solar generation facilities in Texas, with expected commercial operation dates beginning in 2025, and additional solar generation facilities at retired or to-be retired plant sites in Illinois with expected commercial operation dates beginning in 2026.\nWe will only invest in growth projects if we are confident in the expected returns.\n9\nTable of Contents\nGreen Finance Framework\nIn December 2021, we announced the publication of our Green Finance Framework, which allows us to issue green financial instruments to fund new or existing projects that support renewable energy and energy efficiency with alignment to our ESG strategy. \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)\nIn May 2023, the EPA released a proposal regulating power plant GHG emissions, while also proposing to repeal the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule that had been finalized by the EPA in July 2019. In May 2024, the EPA published a final GHG rule that repealed the ACE rule and sets limits for (a) new natural gas-fired combustion turbines and (b) existing coal-, oil- and natural gas-fired steam generation units. The standards are based on technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) and natural gas co-firing. Starting in 2030, the rule would begin to require more CO\n2\n emissions control at certain existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating units, with more stringent standards beginning in 2032 for coal-fired units that plan to operate for a longer period of time. For new natural gas combustion turbines that operate more frequently, the rule would phase in increasingly stringent CO\n2\n requirements over time. Under the rule, states would be required to submit plans to the EPA within 24 months of the rule's publication in the Federal Register that provide for the establishment, implementation, and enforcement of standards of performance for existing sources. These state plans must generally establish standards that are at least as stringent as the EPA's emission guidelines. Under the rule, existing coal-fired steam generation units that will operate on or after January 1, 2039 must start complying with their standards of performance (based on application of CCS with 90 percent capture) by January 1, 2032. Units that are permanently retiring before January 1, 2039, but after December 31, 2031, must start complying with their standards of performance (based on co-firing with 40 percent natural gas on a heat input basis) beginning on January 1, 2030. Units permanently retiring by January 1, 2032 are exempt from the rule. Given our previously announced coal unit retirement commitments, our Martin Lake and Oak Grove plants are the only coal units that are subject to this rule. Our Graham, Lake Hubbard, Stryker Creek and Trinidad oil/natural gas facilities are also regulated under this rule. None of our existing large or small combustion turbines are subject to this rule. The rule also regulates any new gas units. For new combustion turbine units, the rule establishes three different categories depending on how intensively those units are operated, with immediate compliance obligations for all three categories but more stringent standards beginning in 2032 only for the category of units operating the most intensively. Following finalization of the rule in May 2024, 17 petitions for review from various states, industry groups and companies were filed in the D.C. Circuit Court along with multiple motions to stay the rule. We are participating in an industry coalition challenging the rule. In July 2024, the D.C. Circuit Court denied the motions to stay and a number of parties subsequently filed an emergency request with the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the rule which was denied in October 2024. Oral argument on the merits of the legal challenges to the rule was held in December 2024 before the D.C. Circuit Court. In February 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted the unopposed motion filed by the Department of Justice on behalf of the EPA, holding the litigation in abeyance for a period of 60 days while the new leadership at the EPA evaluates the rule and determines how it wishes to proceed.\nState Regulation of GHGs\nMany states where we operate generation facilities have, are considering, or are in some stage of implementing, state-only regulatory programs intended to reduce emissions of GHGs from stationary sources as a means of addressing climate change.\nRegional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)\n — RGGI is a state-driven GHG emission control program that took effect in 2009 and was initially implemented by ten New England and Mid-Atlantic states to reduce CO\n2\n emissions from power plants. The participating RGGI states implemented a cap-and-trade program. Compliance with RGGI can be achieved by reducing emissions, purchasing or trading allowances, or securing offset allowances from an approved offset project. We are required to hold allowances equal to at least 50 percent of emissions in each of the first two years of the three-year control period.\nIn December 2017, the RGGI states released an updated model rule with changes to the CO\n2\n budget trading program, including an additional 30 percent reduction in the CO\n2\n annual cap by the year 2030, relative to 2020 levels. RGGI is currently conducting its third program review which may include an updated model rule.\nOur generation facilities in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Virginia emitted approximately 11 million short tons of CO\n2\n during 2024. The spot market price of RGGI allowances required to operate these facilities as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $24.13 per allowance. While the cost of allowances required to operate our RGGI-affected facilities is expected to increase in future years, we expect that the cost of compliance would be reflected in the power market, and the actual impact to gross margin would be largely offset by an increase in revenue.\n10\nTable of Contents\nMassachusetts\n — In August 2017, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) adopted final rules establishing an annual declining limit on aggregate CO\n2\n emissions from 21 in-state fossil-fueled electricity generation units. The rules establish an allowance trading system under which the annual aggregate electricity generation unit sector cap on CO\n2\n emissions declines from 8.96 million metric tons in 2018 to 1.8 million metric tons in 2050. MassDEP allocated emission allowances to affected facilities for 2018. Beginning in 2019, the allocation process transitioned to a competitive auction process whereby allowances are partially distributed through a competitive auction process and partially distributed based on the process and schedule established by the rule. Beginning in 2021, all allowances were distributed through the auction. Limited banking of unused allowances is allowed.\nVirginia\n — In May 2019, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality issued a final rule to adopt a carbon cap-and trade program for fossil-fueled electricity generation units, including our Hopewell facility, beginning in 2020. The program is based on the RGGI proposed 2017 model rule and linked Virginia to RGGI in 2021. The Governor of Virginia issued an executive order in January 2022 to begin the process of removing the state from RGGI. The Virginia State Pollution Control Board withdrew the state from RGGI at the end of 2023, coinciding with the end of the program's three-year compliance period and contract with RGGI, Inc. In August 2023, opponents of the state's action filed suit seeking a stay alleging withdrawal from RGGI is impermissible without new legislation. In November 2024, a state circuit court judge ruled that the removal of Virginia from RGGI was unlawful, but the state has moved to stay the circuit court's judgment. Virginia is not participating in RGGI at this time.\nNew Jersey\n — In January 2018, the Governor of New Jersey signed an executive order directing the state's environmental agency and public utilities board to begin the process of rejoining RGGI, and New Jersey formally rejoined RGGI in June 2019. In June 2019, New Jersey adopted two rules that govern New Jersey's reentry into the RGGI auction and distribution of the RGGI auction proceeds.\nPennsylvania\n — In April 2022, the Pennsylvania Environmental Quality Board finalized regulations that would establish Pennsylvania's participation in RGGI. In July 2022, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania (Commonwealth Court) took action to uphold a preliminary injunction over Pennsylvania's RGGI regulations. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied a request for emergency relief from the injunction in August 2022. In November 2023, the Commonwealth Court found that Pennsylvania cannot join RGGI without legislative approval and enjoined the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection from implementing RGGI. The state has appealed this decision to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court where it is still pending. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protections has indicated it will not seek to implement RGGI until the Pennsylvania Supreme Court acts. As a result, RGGI is not being implemented or enforced in Pennsylvania at this time.\nCalifornia\n — Our assets in California are subject to the California Global Warming Solutions Act, which required the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop a GHG emission control program to reduce emissions of GHGs in the state to 1990 levels by 2020. In April 2015, the Governor of California issued an executive order establishing a new statewide GHG reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 to ensure California meets its 2050 GHG reduction target of 80 percent below 1990 levels. We have participated in quarterly auctions or in secondary markets, as appropriate, to secure allowances for our affected assets.\nIn July 2017, California enacted legislation extending its GHG cap-and-trade program through 2030 and the CARB adopted amendments to its cap-and-trade regulations that, among other things, established a framework for extending the program beyond 2020 and linking the program to the new cap-and-trade program in Ontario, Canada beginning in January 2018.\nAir Emissions\nThe Clean Air Act (CAA)\nThe CAA and comparable state laws and regulations relating to air emissions impose various responsibilities on owners and operators of sources of air emissions, which include requirements to obtain construction and operating permits, pay permit fees, monitor emissions, submit reports and compliance certifications, and keep records. The CAA requires that fossil-fueled electricity generation plants meet certain pollutant emission standards and have sufficient emission allowances to cover SO\n2\n emissions and in some regions NO\nX\n emissions.\n11\nTable of Contents\nIn order to ensure continued compliance with the CAA and related rules and regulations, we utilize various emission reduction technologies. These technologies include flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems, dry sorbent injection (DSI), baghouses and activated carbon injection or mercury oxidation systems on select units and electrostatic precipitators, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, low-NO\nX\n burners and/or overfire air systems on all units.\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and Good Neighbor Plan\nIn 2016, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule Update (CSAPR Update) to address 22 states' obligations with respect to the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). In 2019, following challenges by numerous parties, the D.C. Circuit Court found that the CSAPR Update did not fully address certain states' 2008 ozone NAAQS obligations. In October 2020, the EPA proposed an action to address the outstanding 2008 ozone NAAQS obligations in response to the D.C. Circuit Court's 2019 ruling. Vistra subsidiaries filed comments on that rulemaking in December 2020, and the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register on April 30, 2021 that reduces ozone season NO\nX\n budgets in certain states. We do not believe that the final rule causes a material adverse impact on our future financial results.\nIn October 2015, the EPA revised the primary and secondary ozone NAAQS to lower the 8-hour standard for ozone emissions during ozone season (May to September). As required under the CAA, in October 2018, the State of Texas submitted a State Implementation Plan (SIP) to the EPA demonstrating that emissions from Texas sources do not contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other state with respect to the revised ozone NAAQS. In February 2023, the EPA disapproved Texas' SIP and the State of Texas, Luminant, certain trade groups, and others challenged that disapproval in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit Court). In March 2023, those same parties filed motions to stay the EPA's SIP disapproval in the Fifth Circuit Court, and the EPA moved to transfer our challenges to the D.C. Circuit Court or have those challenges dismissed.\nIn April 2022, prior to the EPA's disapproval of Texas' SIP, the EPA proposed a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to address the 2015 ozone NAAQS. We, along with many other companies, trade groups, states and ISOs, including ERCOT, PJM and MISO, filed responsive comments to the EPA's proposal in June 2022, expressing concerns about certain elements of the proposal, particularly those that may result in challenges to electric reliability under certain conditions. In March 2023, the EPA administrator signed its final FIP, called the Good Neighbor Plan (GNP). The FIP applied to 22 states beginning with the 2023 ozone seasons. States where Vistra operates generation units that would be subject to this rule are Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. Texas would be moved into the revised (and more restrictive) Group 3 trading program previously established in the Revised CSAPR Update Rule that includes emission budgets for 2023 that the EPA says are achievable through existing controls installed at power plants. Allowances will be limited under the program and will be further reduced beginning in ozone season 2026 to a level that is intended to reduce operating time of coal-fueled power plants during ozone season or force coal plants to retire, particularly those that do not have selective catalytic reduction systems such as our Martin Lake power plant.\nIn May 2023, the Fifth Circuit Court granted our motion to stay the EPA's disapproval of Texas' SIP pending a decision on the merits and denied the EPA's motion to transfer our challenge to the D.C. Circuit Court. As a result of the stay, we do not believe the EPA has authority to implement the GNP FIP as to Texas sources pending the resolution of the merits, meaning that Texas will remain in Group 2 and not be subject to any requirements under the GNP FIP at least until the Fifth Circuit Court rules on the merits. Oral argument was heard in December 2023 before the Fifth Circuit Court. In June 2023, the EPA published the final FIP in the Federal Register, which included requirements as to Texas despite the stay of the SIP disapproval by the Fifth Circuit Court. In June 2023, the State of Texas, Luminant and various other parties also filed challenges to the GNP FIP in the Fifth Circuit Court, filed a motion to stay the FIP and confirm venue for this dispute in the Fifth Circuit Court. After the motion to stay and to confirm venue was filed, the EPA signed an interim final rule on June 29, 2023 that confirms the GNP FIP as to Texas is stayed. In February 2025, the Department of Justice filed a motion on behalf of the EPA in the Fifth Circuit Court, seeking to hold the litigation in abeyance while the new leadership at the EPA evaluates the rule and determines how it wishes to proceed. In February 2025, the State of Texas filed a response opposing the requested abatement, which we joined. In July 2023, the Fifth Circuit Court ruled that the GNP FIP challenge would be held in abeyance pending the resolution of the litigation on the SIP disapproval and denied the motion to stay as not needed given the EPA's administrative stay. In a related action brought by other states and parties challenging the GNP FIP, in June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the GNP FIP pending a review of the merits by the D.C. Circuit Court and any further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. As a result, the GNP FIP is now stayed for all covered states until the courts resolve the legality of the FIP. In February 2025, the D.C. Circuit Court denied a motion filed by the Department of Justice on behalf of the EPA, seeking to hold the litigation in abeyance for a period of 60 days while the new leadership at the EPA evaluates the rule and determines how it wishes to proceed.\n12\nTable of Contents\nRegional Haze — Reasonable Progress and Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for Texas\nThe Regional Haze Program of the CAA establishes \"as a national goal the prevention of any future, and the remedying of any existing, impairment of visibility in mandatory class I federal areas which impairment results from man-made pollution.\"  There are two components to the Regional Haze Program. First, states must establish goals for reasonable progress for Class I federal areas within the state and establish long-term strategies to reach those goals and to assist Class I federal areas in neighboring states to achieve reasonable progress set by those states towards a goal of natural visibility by 2064. Second, certain electricity generation units built between 1962 and 1977 are subject to BART standards designed to improve visibility if such units cause or contribute to impairment of visibility in a federal class I area.\nIn October 2017, the EPA issued a final rule addressing BART for Texas electricity generation units, with the rule serving as a partial approval of Texas' 2009 SIP and a partial FIP. For SO\n2\n, the rule established an intrastate Texas emission allowance trading program as a \"BART alternative\" that operates in a similar fashion to a CSAPR trading program. The program includes 39 generation units (including the Martin Lake, Big Brown, Monticello, Sandow 4, Coleto Creek, Stryker 2, and Graham 2 plants). The compliance obligations in the program started on January 1, 2019. For NO\nX\n, the rule adopted the CSAPR's ozone program as BART and for particulate matter, the rule approved Texas' SIP that determines that no electricity generation units are subject to BART for particulate matter. In August 2020, the EPA issued a final rule affirming the prior BART final rule but also included additional revisions that were proposed in November 2019. Challenges to both the 2017 rule and the 2020 rules have been consolidated in the D.C. Circuit Court, where we have intervened in support of the EPA. We are in compliance with the rule, and the retirements of our Monticello, Big Brown, and Sandow 4 plants have enhanced our ability to comply. The EPA is in the process of reconsidering the BART rule, and the challenges in the D.C. Circuit Court have been held in abeyance pending the EPA's final action on reconsideration. In May 2023, a proposed BART rule was published in the Federal Register that would withdraw the trading program provisions of the prior rule and would establish SO\n2\n limits on six facilities in Texas, including Martin Lake and Coleto Creek. Under the current proposal, compliance would be required within 3 years for Martin Lake and 5 years for Coleto Creek. Due to the announced shutdown for Coleto Creek, we do not anticipate any impacts at that facility, and we are evaluating potential compliance options at Martin Lake should this proposal become final. We submitted comments to the EPA on this proposal in August 2023.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)\nThe CAA requires the EPA to regulate emissions of pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. The EPA has established NAAQS for six such pollutants, including SO\n2\n and ozone. Each state is responsible for developing a SIP that will attain and maintain the NAAQS. These plans may result in the imposition of emission limits on our facilities.\n13\nTable of Contents\nSO\n2\n Designations for Texas\nIn November 2016, the EPA finalized its nonattainment designations for counties surrounding our Martin Lake generation plant and our now retired Big Brown and Monticello plants. The final designations require Texas to develop nonattainment plans for these areas. In February 2017, the State of Texas and Luminant filed challenges to the nonattainment designations in the Fifth Circuit Court. In August 2019, the EPA issued a proposed Error Correction Rule for all three areas, which, if finalized, would have revised its previous nonattainment designations and each area at issue would be designated unclassifiable. In May 2021, the EPA finalized a \"Clean Data\" determination for the areas surrounding the retired Big Brown and Monticello plants, redesignating those areas as attainment based on monitoring data supporting an attainment designation. In June 2021, the EPA published two notices; one that it was withdrawing the August 2019 Error Correction Rule and a second separate notice denying petitions from Luminant and the State of Texas to reconsider the original nonattainment designations. We, along with the State of Texas, challenged that EPA action and have consolidated it with the pending challenge in the Fifth Circuit Court, and this case was argued before the Fifth Circuit Court in July 2022. In September 2021, the TCEQ considered a proposal for its nonattainment SIP revision for the Martin Lake area and an agreed order to reduce SO\n2\n emissions from the plant. The proposed agreed order associated with the SIP proposal reduced emission limits as of January 2022. Emission reductions required are those necessary to demonstrate attainment with the NAAQS. The TCEQ's SIP action was finalized in February 2022 and has been submitted to the EPA for review and approval. In January 2024, in a split decision, the Fifth Circuit Court denied the petitions for review we and the State of Texas filed over the EPA's 2016 nonattainment designation for SO\n2\n for the area around Martin Lake. As a result of this decision, the EPA's nonattainment designation – originally made in 2016 – remains in place. In February 2024, we filed a petition asking the full Fifth Circuit Court to review the panel decision issued in January 2024, which remains pending before the full Fifth Circuit Court. In August 2024, the EPA proposed a Finding of Failure to attain the SO\n2\n standard for Rusk and Panola Counties, a partial approval and partial disapproval of the Texas SIP and a proposed federal plan for the area. In December 2024, the EPA finalized the Finding of Failure to attain the standard and stated that it would take final action of the SIP partial approval and disapproval in a future action. In February 2025, we, along with the State of Texas, filed a challenge to the Finding of Failure in the Fifth Circuit Court.\nOzone Designations\nThe EPA issued a final rule in October 2015 lowering the ozone NAAQS from 75 to 70 parts per billion. Areas surrounding our Dicks Creek, Miami Fort and Zimmer facilities in Ohio, our Calumet facility in Illinois and our Wise, Ennis and Midlothian facilities in Texas were designated marginal nonattainment areas in June 2018 by the EPA with an attainment deadline of August 2021. In June 2022, the areas surrounding our Ohio Dicks Creek and Miami Fort facilities were redesignated \"attainment.\" The EPA redesignated the area around our Texas Wise, Ennis and Midlothian facilities to \"moderate\" in October 2022 and again \"bumped up\" the classification to serious in June 2024. Middlesex County in New Jersey, where our Sayreville facility is located, was designated a \"moderate\" nonattainment area.  In July 2024, the state of New Jersey, in collaboration with the states of New York and Connecticut requested a voluntary bump up of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island nonattainment area, which includes Middlesex County where our Sayreville facility is located. States will be required to develop SIPs to address emissions in areas with a higher (more stringent) classification.\nParticulate Matte\nr\nIn February 2024, the EPA issued a rule addressing the annual health-based national ambient air quality standards for fine particulate matter (or PM2.5). In general, the rule lowers the level of the annual PM2.5 standard from 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) to 9.0 µg/m3. The effective date of the rule is 60 days from publication in the Federal Register, and the earliest attainment date for areas exceeding the new standard is 2032. Based on 2021-2023 design value associated with the rule, we have just four plants (Calumet (Illinois), Dicks Creek and Miami Fort (Ohio), and Lake Hubbard (Texas)) operating in areas where the air quality monitoring data are currently exceeding the new PM2.5 standard. We have previously announced that our Miami Fort generation facility will close by the end of 2027. States will have to develop a plan (by late 2027 at the earliest) to get those areas into attainment and there would be a possibility that additional controls would be required for those sites. However, before the state begins this planning process, the designation process will occur within two years from the issuance of the final rule. The states develop recommendations about the boundaries of the nonattainment counties and the EPA must finalize the designations including the boundaries of each nonattainment area.\nCoal Combustion Residuals (CCR)/Groundwater\nThe combustion of coal to generate electric power creates large quantities of ash and byproducts that are managed at power generation facilities in dry form in landfills and in wet form in surface impoundments. Each of our coal-fueled plants has at least one CCR surface impoundment.\n14\nTable of Contents\nCCR Rule Revisions and Extension Applications\nThe EPA's CCR rule, which took effect in October 2015, establishes minimum federal requirements for the construction, retrofitting, operation and closure of, and corrective action with respect to, existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments, as well as inactive CCR surface impoundments. The requirements include location restrictions, structural integrity criteria, groundwater monitoring, operating criteria, liner design criteria, closure and post-closure care, recordkeeping and notification. The deadlines for beginning and completing closure vary depending on several factors. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (the WIIN Act), which was enacted in December 2016, provides for EPA review and approval of state CCR permit programs.\nIn August 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court issued a decision that vacates and remands certain provisions of the 2015 CCR rule, including an applicability exemption for legacy impoundments. In August 2020, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a deadline of April 11, 2021 to cease receipt of waste and initiate closure at unlined CCR impoundments. The 2020 final rule allows a generation plant to seek the EPA's approval to extend this deadline if no alternative disposal capacity is available and either a conversion to comply with the CCR rule is underway or retirement will occur by either 2023 or 2028 (depending on the size of the impoundment at issue).\nPrior to the November 2020 deadline to seek extensions, we submitted applications to the EPA requesting compliance extensions under both conversion and retirement scenarios. In January 2022, the EPA determined that our conversion and retirement applications for our CCR facilities were complete but has not yet proposed action on any of those applications.\nIn addition, in January 2022, the EPA also made a series of public statements, including in a press release, that purported to impose new, more onerous closure requirements for CCR units. In April 2022, we, along with the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group (USWAG), a trade association of over 130 utility operating companies, energy companies, and certain other industry associations, filed petitions for review with the D.C. Circuit Court and asked the court to determine that the EPA cannot implement or enforce the new purported requirements because the EPA has not followed the required procedures. The State of Texas and the TCEQ intervened in support of the petitions filed by the Vistra subsidiaries and USWAG, and various environmental groups have intervened on behalf of the EPA. In June 2024, the D.C. Circuit Court dismissed the petitions filed challenging the EPA's January 2022 statements because it found the statements did not amend the existing CCR regulations, and thus the D.C. Circuit Court did not have jurisdiction to review them.\nLegacy CCR Rulemaking\nIn May 2024, the EPA published a final rule that expands coverage of groundwater monitoring and closure requirements to the following two new categories of units: (a) legacy CCR surface impoundments which are CCR surface impoundments that no longer receive CCR but contained both CCR and liquids on or after October 19, 2015 and (b) \"CCR management units\" (CCRMUs) which generally could encompass noncontainerized ash deposits greater than one ton and impoundments and landfills that closed prior to October 19, 2015. As part of the rule, the EPA identified numerous CCR management units across the country, including ten of our potential units. The Vermilion ash ponds discussed below are the only unit which we believe qualify as a legacy CCR surface impoundment and given our closure plan for that site we do not believe the rule will have any impact on that site. CCRMUs with 1,000 or more tons of CCR must comply with the CCR's groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure and post-closure requirements. For CCRMUs, complete facility evaluation reports are due within 33 months after publication of the rule, initial groundwater reports are due January 31, 2029, and the deadline to initiate closure, if needed, will start in 2029. Closure of the CCRMUs may also be deferred beyond those dates depending on certain factors, including where the CCRMU is located beneath critical infrastructure. In addition, certain closures may not be required when closure was previously approved under a state program. Because facility evaluation reports will determine our unit-specific compliance obligations, we cannot determine them at this time. In August 2024, we, along with USWAG, several other generating companies, and 17 states, including Texas, filed a challenge to the rule in the D.C. Circuit Court. In February 2025, the D.C. Circuit Court granted an unopposed motion filed by the Department of Justice on behalf of the EPA, holding the litigation in abeyance for a period of 120 days while the new leadership at the EPA evaluates the rule and determines how it wishes to proceed.\nMISO\n — In 2012, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) issued violation notices alleging violations of groundwater standards onsite at our Baldwin and Vermilion facilities' CCR surface impoundments. These violation notices remain unresolved; however, in 2016, the IEPA approved our closure and post-closure care plans for the Baldwin old east, east, and west fly ash CCR surface impoundments. We have completed closure activities at those ponds at our Baldwin facility.\n15\nTable of Contents\nAt our retired Vermilion facility, which was not potentially subject to the EPA's 2015 CCR rule until the aforementioned D.C. Circuit Court decision in August 2018, we submitted proposed corrective action plans involving closure of two CCR surface impoundments (\ni.e.\n, the old east and the north impoundments) to the IEPA in 2012, and we submitted revised plans in 2014. In May 2017, in response to a request from the IEPA for additional information regarding the closure of these Vermilion surface impoundments, we agreed to perform additional groundwater sampling and closure options and riverbank stabilizing options. In June 2018, the IEPA issued a violation notice for alleged seep discharges claimed to be coming from the surface impoundments at our retired Vermilion facility, which is owned by our subsidiary DMG, and that notice was referred to the Illinois Attorney General. In June 2021, the Illinois Attorney General and the Vermilion County State Attorney filed a complaint in Illinois state court with an agreed interim consent order which the court subsequently entered. Given the violation notices and the enforcement action, the unique characteristics of the site, and the proximity of the site to the only national scenic river in Illinois, we agreed to enter into the interim consent order to resolve this matter. Per the terms of the agreed interim consent order, DMG is required to evaluate the closure alternatives under the requirements of the Illinois Coal Ash regulation (discussed below) and close the site by removal. In addition, the interim consent order requires that during the impoundment closure process, impacted groundwater will be collected before it leaves the site or enters the nearby Vermilion river and, if necessary, DMG will be required to install temporary riverbank protection if the river migrates within a certain distance of the impoundments. The interim order was modified in December 2022 to require certain amendments to the Safety Emergency Response Plan. In June 2023, the Illinois state court approved and entered the final consent order, which included the terms above and a requirement that when IEPA issues a final closure permit for the site, DMG will demolish the power station and submit for approval to construct an on-site landfill within the footprint of the former plant to store and manage the coal ash. These proposed closure costs are reflected in the ARO in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 13 to the Financial Statements).\nIn 2012, the IEPA issued violation notices alleging violations of groundwater standards at the Newton and Coffeen facilities' CCR surface impoundments. We are addressing these CCR surface impoundments in accordance with the federal CCR rule.\nIn July 2019, coal ash disposal and storage legislation in Illinois was enacted. The legislation addresses state requirements for the proper closure of coal ash ponds in the state of Illinois. The law tasks the IEPA and the IPCB to set up a series of guidelines, rules, and permit requirements for closure of ash ponds. Under the final rule, which was finalized and became effective in April 2021, coal ash impoundment owners would be required to submit a closure alternative analysis to the IEPA for the selection of the best method for coal ash remediation at a particular site. The rule does not mandate closure by removal at any site. In May 2021, we, along with other industry petitioners, filed an appeal in the Illinois Fourth Judicial District over certain provisions of the final rule. In March 2024, the Illinois Fourth Judicial District issued a decision denying the industry petitions. We do not anticipate any impacts from this decision. In October 2021, we filed operating permit applications for 18 impoundments as required by the Illinois coal ash rule, and filed construction permit applications for three of our sites in January 2022 and five of our sites in July 2022. One additional closure construction application was filed for our Baldwin facility in August 2023.\nFor all of the above CCR matters, if certain corrective action measures, including groundwater treatment or removal of ash, are required at any of our coal-fueled facilities, we may incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The Illinois coal ash rule was finalized in April 2021 and does not require removal. However, the rule required us to undertake further site-specific evaluations required by each program. We will not know the full range of decommissioning costs, including groundwater remediation, if any, that ultimately may be required under the Illinois rule until permit applications have been approved by the IEPA and as such, an estimate of such costs cannot be made. The CCR surface impoundment and landfill closure costs currently reflected in our existing ARO liabilities reflect the costs of closure methods that our operations and environmental services teams determined were appropriate based on the existing closure requirements at the time we recorded those ARO liabilities, and is reasonably possible for those to increase once the IEPA determines final closure requirements. Once the IEPA acts on our permit applications, we will reassess the decommissioning costs and adjust our ARO liabilities accordingly.\nWater\nThe EPA and the environmental regulatory bodies of states in which we operate have jurisdiction over the diversion, impoundment and withdrawal of water for cooling and other purposes and the discharge of wastewater (including storm water) from our facilities. We believe our facilities are presently in material compliance with applicable federal and state requirements relating to these activities. We believe we hold all required permits relating to these activities for facilities in operation and have applied for or obtained necessary permits for facilities under construction. We also believe we can satisfy the requirements necessary to obtain any required permits or renewals.\n16\nTable of Contents\nEffluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs)\n — In November 2015, the EPA revised the ELGs for steam electricity generation facilities, which will impose more stringent standards (as individual permits are renewed) for wastewater streams, such as FGD, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control wastewaters. Various parties filed petitions for review of the ELG rule, and the petitions were consolidated in the Fifth Circuit Court. In April 2017, the EPA granted petitions requesting reconsideration of the ELG rule and administratively stayed the rule's compliance date deadlines. In April 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court vacated and remanded portions of the EPA's ELG rule pertaining to effluent limitations for legacy wastewater and leachate. The EPA published a final rule in October 2020 that extends the compliance date for both FGD and bottom ash transport water to no later than December 2025, as negotiated with the state permitting agency. Additionally, the final rule allows for a retirement exemption that exempts facilities certifying that units will retire by December 2028 provided certain effluent limitations are met. In November 2020, environmental groups petitioned for review of the new ELG revisions, and Vistra subsidiaries filed a motion to intervene in support of the EPA in December 2020. Notifications were made to Texas, Illinois, and Ohio state agencies on the retirement exemption for applicable coal plants by the regulatory deadline of October 13, 2021. In May 2024, the EPA published the final ELG rule revisions, which contain new requirements for legacy wastewater and combustion residual leachate. The final rule also leaves in place the subcategory for facilities that permanently cease coal combustion by 2028. We are reviewing the rule for impact but believe it will require additional treatment costs for legacy wastewaters during pond closure activities and combustion residual leachate. At this time, we don't expect the impact of these additional treatment costs to be material. A number of parties have since challenged the rule and that case is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. We are not a party to that litigation. In February 2025, the Department of Justice on behalf of the EPA filed an unopposed motion seeking to hold the litigation in abeyance while the new leadership at the EPA evaluates the rule and determines how it wishes to proceed.\nRadioactive Waste\nThe nuclear industry has developed ways to store used nuclear fuel on site at nuclear generation facilities, primarily using dry cask storage, since there are no facilities for reprocessing or disposal of used nuclear fuel currently in operation in the U.S. Luminant stores its used nuclear fuel on-site in storage pools or dry cask storage facilities and believes its on-site used nuclear fuel storage capability is sufficient for the foreseeable future.\nCorporate Information\nVistra is a Delaware corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE.

See Item 7. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, and Results of Operations\n in our \n202\n3\n Form 10-K\n for a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, which is incorporated here by reference. The Sunset segment was eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2024, resulting in the recast of results for four coal facilities to the East segment and one coal facility to the Texas segment (see Note 19 to the Financial Statements). The recast is reflected in the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The re-segmentation did not result in a material change in the reported results for the East and Texas segments for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\n50\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Activities and Events, and Items Influencing Future Performance\nMerger with Energy Harbor\nOn March 1, 2024 (Merger Date), pursuant to a transaction agreement dated March 6, 2023 (Transaction Agreement), (i) Vistra Operations transferred certain of its subsidiary entities into Vistra Vision, (ii) Black Pen Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Vistra, merged with and into Energy Harbor, (iii) Energy Harbor became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vistra Vision, and (iv) affiliates of Nuveen Asset Management, LLC (Nuveen) and Avenue Capital Management II, L.P. (Avenue) exchanged a portion of the Energy Harbor shares held by Nuveen and Avenue for a 15% equity interest of Vistra Vision (collectively, Energy Harbor Merger). The Energy Harbor Merger combined Energy Harbor's and Vistra's nuclear and retail businesses and certain Vistra Zero renewables and energy storage facilities to provide diversification and scale across multiple carbon-free technologies (dispatchable and renewables/storage) and the retail business. The cash consideration for Energy Harbor Merger was funded by Vistra Operations using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Commodity-Linked Facility, the Receivables Facility and the Repurchase Facility. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements.\nAcquisition of Noncontrolling Interest\nOn September 18, 2024 (the UPA Transaction Date), Vistra Operations and Vistra Vision Holdings I LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Vistra Operations (Vistra Vision Holdings), entered into separate Unit Purchase Agreements (as amended, the UPAs) with each of Nuveen and Avenue, pursuant to which Vistra Vision Holdings agreed to purchase each of Nuveen's and Avenue's combined 15% noncontrolling interest in Vistra Vision for approximately $3.2 billion in cash (collectively, the Transaction). The Transaction closed on December 31, 2024 (the Closing Date) and Vistra Vision Holdings now owns 100% of the equity interests in Vistra Vision. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements.\nNuclear Plant License Renewals\nIn July 2024, our application for license renewal at our two-unit Comanche Peak Nuclear Plant was approved by the NRC. The licenses for Units 1 and 2 now extend into 2050 and 2053, respectively, an additional 20 years beyond our original licenses.\nIn 2023, the Perry Nuclear Plant filed a license extension application to operate through 2046, an additional 20 years beyond the existing license. A decision from the NRC is expected in late 2025.\nPlanned Gas-Fueled Dispatchable Power in ERCOT\nIn May 2024, we announced our intention to add up to 2,000 MW of dispatchable, natural gas-fueled electricity capacity in west, central, and north Texas consisting of the following projects:\n•\nBuilding up to 860 MW of advanced simple-cycle peaking plants to be located in west Texas to support the increasing power needs of the region, including the state's oil and gas industry.\n•\nRepowering the coal-fueled Coleto Creek Power Plant near Goliad, Texas, set to retire in 2027 to comply with EPA rules, as a natural-gas fueled plant with up to 600 MW of capacity.\n•\nCompleting upgrades at existing natural gas-fueled plants that will add more than 500 MW of summer capacity and 100 MW of winter capacity.\nOur announced plan is based on market reforms that policymakers passed in the 2023 Texas legislative session, which ERCOT and the PUCT are currently implementing. These market reforms are focused on grid reliability and proper market signals. If successfully implemented, they could offer the regulatory framework necessary for Vistra to confidently make the long-term investments in these capacity projects. In addition, in July 2024, we filed applications with the PUCT under the Texas Energy Fund loan program seeking financing for the 860 MW of new advanced simple-cycle peaking plants referenced above. In August 2024, the PUCT notified Vistra that an application for one of its west Texas advanced simple-cycle peaking plants was selected for due diligence as part of the Texas Energy Fund loan program, which is ongoing. Vistra's other application for a second west Texas gas plant remains active. An invitation to due diligence does not mean an applicant is awarded a loan. Vistra's decision to move forward with the new west Texas gas plant project is contingent upon supportive market reforms, approval of our Texas Energy Fund loan application, and other factors, including state and federal environmental regulations and long-term wholesale trends that continue to support gas generation.\n51\nTable of Contents\nMoss Landing 300 Battery and Martin Lake Unit 1 Updates\nIn January 2025, a fire occurred at our Moss Landing 300 MW battery energy storage facility in CAISO. We are still investigating the cause and impacts, but expect to write off approximately $400 million of plant value to depreciation expense in the first quarter of 2025, representing the facility's remaining net book value. Moss Landing 300 is part of the Moss Landing complex, which includes two other battery facilities and a gas plant, with an aggregate book value of approximately $1 billion including Moss Landing 300. While the gas plant is operational, the other two battery facilities remain offline as we investigate the fire. Additional costs incurred from the events include loss of revenue from the facilities being offline, and may include litigation costs and penalties under contracts. We will continue to assess if a triggering event has occurred to evaluate impairment for the other complex assets.\nOn November 27, 2024, we experienced a fire at Unit 1 of our Martin Lake facility in ERCOT, an 815 MW unit. The depreciation expense associated with the damaged property was less than $1 million. We currently expect the unit to return to service in June 2025.\nWe expect to recover a significant portion of the direct losses incurred from each event through property damage insurance and business interruption insurance. However, given uncertainty in timing of recoveries and potential indirect impacts to other facilities, we cannot predict the net impact these events will have on our results of operations for 2025.\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\n (IRA) \nIn August 2022, the U.S. enacted the IRA, which, among other things, implements substantial new and modified energy tax credits, including recognizing the value of existing carbon-free nuclear power by providing for a nuclear PTC, a solar PTC, and a first-time stand-alone battery storage investment tax credit. The IRA also implements a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on book income of certain large corporations, and a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases. The section 45U nuclear PTC is available to existing nuclear facilities from 2024 through 2032 and provides a federal tax credit of up to $15 per  MWh, subject to phase out as power prices increase above $25 per MWh (each subject to annual inflation adjustments). The Company accounts for transferable ITCs and PTCs we expect to receive by analogy to the grant model within International Accounting Standards 20, \nAccounting for Government Grants and Disclosures of Government Assistance\n. As discussed in Note 4, we recognized transferable nuclear PTC revenues of $545 million in the year ended December 31, 2024. Treasury regulations are expected to further define the scope of the legislation in many important respects, including critical guidance interpreting the nuclear PTC. This guidance could have a material impact on our estimate and would be reflected as a change in estimate in the period in which the guidance is received. We do not expect Vistra to be subject to the CAMT in the 2024 tax year as it applies only to corporations with a three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income in excess of $1 billion. We have taken the CAMT and relevant extensions or expansions of existing tax credits applicable to projects in our immediate development pipeline into account when forecasting cash taxes.\n \nFinancial and Operating Performance\nThe following are financial and operating highlights we achieved in the execution of our four strategic priorities:\nLong-term, attractive earnings profile through the integrated business model.\n•\nWe continued to execute our integrated business model through exceptional operational performance by capitalizing on market opportunities that drove strong earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. This highlights our competitive advantage of coupling retail with our reliable and efficient generation fleet and wholesale commodity risk management capabilities, which reduces the effects of commodity price movements and contributes to the stability and predictability of our cash flows.\n•\nOur commercial team focused on effectively and efficiently managing risk by opportunistically hedging and optimizing our assets and business positions, which led to strong plant operating performance and energy margins.\n•\nOur retail brands served the retail electricity and natural gas needs of end-use residential, small business, and commercial and industrial electricity customers through multiple sales and marketing channels with products and solutions that differentiates Vistra from our competitors.\nDisciplined capital allocation.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid dividends to common stockholders totaling $305 million.\n52\nTable of Contents\n•\nIn February 2024 and October 2024, the Board authorized incremental amounts of $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, under our stock repurchase program established in October 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 16.6 million shares for $1.2 billion under the program. Through February 24, 2025, total shares repurchased under the program totaled 160 million shares for $4.9 billion, and we have $1.9 billion available for additional repurchases under the program (see Note 16 to the Financial Statements).\nMaintaining a resilient balance sheet.\n•\nWe further diversified our sources of liquidity and improved associated borrowing costs and credit terms through a number of enhancements and amendments to our facilities throughout the year, including (i) the expansion and extension of both our Revolving Credit Facility (expanded by $265 million and extended to 2029) and our Commodity-Linked Facility (expanded facility limit by $175 million and extended to October 2025), (ii) amending both the Vistra Operations Term Loan B-3 Facility and the Vistra Zero Term Loan B Facility to reduce the fixed spread interest by 25 and 75 basis points, respectively, (iii) establishing a $500 million alternative letter of credit facility, and (iv) expanding and extending the Receivables Facility (expanded the purchase limit by $250 million and extended to July 2025).\n•\nIn April 2024, we issued $500 million of 6.000% senior secured notes due 2034 and $1.0 billion of 6.875% senior unsecured notes due 2032. The net proceeds from these issuances were used to refinance senior secured debt maturities in May 2024 and July 2024 and for general corporate purposes.\n•\nIn December 2024, we issued $500 million of 5.050% senior secured notes due 2026 and $750 million of 5.700% senior secured notes due 2034. The net proceeds from these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, including to refinance senior secured debt maturities in May 2025 and payments associated with the Transaction for the purchase of the remaining interest in Vistra Vision.\n•\nIn December 2024, we entered into the BCOP Credit Agreement to fund the development of solar generation and battery ESS facilities in Illinois and Texas.\nStrategic energy transition focused on the reliability, affordability, and sustainability of electric grid.\n•\nIn March 2024, we completed the acquisition of Energy Harbor, adding an additional 4,048 MW of nuclear generation to our fleet.\n•\nWe reached commercial operations for two solar facilities totaling 112 MW of capacity at retired plant sites in Illinois  and continued development and construction activities on additional facilities in Texas and at retired or to-be-retired plant sites in Illinois.\n•\nWe announced plans to repower the Coleto Creek coal generation facility as a natural gas-fueled facility upon its retirement no later than 2027.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, our operating segments delivered strong operating performance with a disciplined focus on cost management, while generating and selling essential electricity in a safe and reliable manner. Our performance reflected strong plant operating performance, growth of our retail business and the effectiveness of our comprehensive hedging strategy.\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nHistorically, the base case assumption for U.S. electricity demand was for modest growth driven by the interplay of growth in population, industrial activity (such as an on-shore manufacturing) and new demand sources (such as electric vehicles), partially offset by continued advancements in energy efficiency. Multiple demand drivers such as emergence of large load data centers and electrification of oil field operations (specifically in the Permian Basin of west Texas), are expected to continue to accelerate load growth in the geographic regions we serve. We are in various discussions with interested counterparties for the potential sale of power from our nuclear and gas facilities pursuant to long-term agreements to supply large load facilities. Such potential transactions are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including potential regulatory review and/or approval and adverse legislative action, which could impact the timing of, and our ability to consummate, any potential transaction.\n53\nTable of Contents\nThe industry continues to experience supply chain constraints and labor shortages that have reduced the availability of certain equipment and supply relevant to construction of new generation facilities, and increased (i) the lead time to procure certain materials necessary to maintain, and (ii) the labor costs associated with maintenance activity on our natural gas, nuclear and coal fleet. We are proactively managing the increased costs of materials and supply chain disruptions and continuing to prudently re-evaluate the business cases and timing of our planned development projects, which has resulted in a deferral of some of our planned capital spend for our renewables projects and could impact the feasibility of additional projects. In addition, we have proactively engaged our suppliers to secure key materials needed to maintain our existing generation facilities prior to future planned outages, and our Vistra Zero operational and development projects are anticipated to benefit from the impact of the IRA. The inflationary environment continues to drive elevated interest rates, resulting in increased refinancing or borrowing costs, including future non-recourse financing for our development projects and future refinancing expected in connection with future debt maturities.\nWe continue to closely monitor developments in the Russia and Ukraine conflict, specifically with regards to, (i) sanctions (or potential sanctions) against Russian energy exports and Russian nuclear fuel supply and enrichment activities, and (ii) actions by Russia to limit energy deliveries, which may further impact commodity prices in Europe and globally. The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act (PRUI Act) was approved by Congress, signed into law by President Biden, and took effect on August 11, 2024. The PRUI Act prohibits importation of Russian uranium; however, the Department of Energy can issue waivers (subject to decreasing annual caps) until December 31, 2027 if there is no alternate source of low-enriched uranium available to keep U.S. nuclear reactors operating or is in the national interest. Additionally, passage of the PRUI Act enabled the allocation of $2.72 billion in federal funding to ramp up production of domestic uranium fuel. On November 15, 2024, the Russian Federation temporarily suspended shipments of uranium to the U.S., stating that they would grant future export licenses on a case-by-case basis. Our 2024 and 2025 refueling plans have not been affected by the Russia and Ukraine conflict, nor have we seen any disruption to the delivery of nuclear fuel impacting our refueling schedules. We work with a diverse set of global nuclear fuel cycle suppliers to procure our nuclear fuel years in advance. We have nuclear fuel contracted to support all our refueling needs through 2029. We continue to take affirmative action by building strategic inventory and deploying mitigating strategies in our procurement portfolio to ensure we can secure the nuclear fuel needed to continue to operate our nuclear facilities through potential Russian supply disruption.\nCapacity Markets\nPJM, NYISO, ISO-NE, MISO and CAISO ensure long-term grid reliability through monthly, semiannual, annual, and multi-year capacity auctions or bilateral transactions where power suppliers commit to making the generation resources available to the ISO as needed for a specific time period. We participate in these capacity market auctions and also enter into bilateral capacity sales, and a portion of our East, and West segment revenues are impacted by the capacity auction results or bilateral contracts. The following information summarizes the auction pricing for zones in which we operate as well as our capacity auction and bilateral capacity sales by planning period. Performance incentive rules increase capacity payments for those resources that are providing excess energy or reserves during a shortage event, while penalizing those that produce less than the required level. \nPJM\nReliability Pricing Model (RPM) auction results, for the zones in which our assets are located, are as follows for each planning year:\n2024-2025\n2025-2026\n(average price per MW-day)\nRTO zone\n$\n28.92 \n$\n269.92 \nComEd zone\n28.92 \n269.92 \nMAAC zone\n49.49 \n269.92 \nEMAAC zone\n53.60 \n269.92 \nATSI zone\n28.92 \n269.92 \nDEOK zone\n96.24 \n269.92 \nDOM zone\n28.92 \n444.26 \n54\nTable of Contents\nOur capacity sales in PJM, net of purchases, aggregated by planning year and capacity type through planning year 2025-2026, are as follows:\nEast Segment\n2024-2025\n2025-2026\nCP auction capacity sold, net (MW)\n9,935 \n10,255 \nBilateral capacity sold, net (MW)\n2,127 \n330 \nTotal segment capacity sold, net (MW)\n12,062 \n10,585 \nAverage price per MW-day\n$\n41.38 \n$\n267.12 \nNYISO\nThe most recent seasonal auction results for NYISO's Rest-of-State zones, in which the capacity for our Independence plant clears, are as follows for each planning period:\nWinter \n2024 - 2025\nPrice per kW-month\n$\n2.00 \nDue to the short-term, seasonal nature of the NYISO capacity auctions, we monetize the majority of our capacity through bilateral trades.

Electricity prices are typically set by the cost to fuel a generation facility and the amount of fuel needed to generate one unit of electricity (Heat Rate) from the generation facility. Market Heat Rate is the implied relationship between wholesale electricity prices and the commodity price of the marginal supplier (generally natural gas plants).\nWholesale electricity prices generally track to increases or decreases in the price of natural gas, with exceptions such as when ERCOT power prices rise significantly during weather events as a result of the scarcity of available generation resources relative to power demand. The price of natural gas is volatile; therefore, the costs to operate a natural gas-fueled generation facility can be volatile as well. In contrast to our natural gas-fueled generation facilities, changes in natural gas prices have no significant effect on the cost of generating power at our nuclear-, lignite- and coal-fueled facilities; however, all other factors being equal, changes in natural gas prices affect our operating margins on these facilities as electricity prices generally track to natural gas prices. Other variables that could impact electricity prices include, but are not limited to, the price of other fuels, generation resources in the region, weather, on-going competition, emerging technologies, and macroeconomic and regulatory factors.\nThe wholesale market price of electricity divided by the market price of natural gas represents the Market Heat Rate. Market Heat Rate can be affected by a number of factors, including generation availability, mix of assets and the efficiency of the marginal supplier (generally natural gas-fueled generation facilities) in generating electricity. Our Market Heat Rate exposure is impacted by changes in the availability of generation resources, such as additions and retirements of generation facilities, and mix of generation assets. For example, increasing renewable (wind and solar) generation capacity generally depresses Market Heat Rates, particularly during periods when total demand is relatively low. However, increasing penetration of renewable generation capacity may also contribute to greater volatility of wholesale market prices independent of changes in the price of natural gas, given their intermittent nature.\nAs a result of our exposure to the variability of natural gas prices and Market Heat Rates, retail sales and hedging activities are critical to our operating results and maintaining consistent cash flow levels. Our integrated power generation and retail electricity business provides us opportunities to hedge our generation position utilizing retail electricity markets as a sales channel. Our approach to managing electricity price risk focuses on the following:\n•\nemploying disciplined, liquidity-efficient hedging and risk management strategies through physical and financial energy-related contracts intended to partially hedge gross margins;\n•\ncontinuing focus on cost management to better withstand gross margin volatility;\n•\nfollowing a retail pricing strategy that appropriately reflects the value of our product offering to customers, the magnitude and costs of commodity price, liquidity risk and retail demand variability; and\n•\nimproving retail customer service to attract and retain high-value customers.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nSee Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies. The following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of GAAP.\nBusiness Combinations\nDetermining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Energy Harbor Merger requires significant estimates and judgments. We determined fair value based on the estimated price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements. The determination of the fair value of property, plant, and equipment contributed and acquired, as well as nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligations required the most significant level of estimation uncertainty.\nThe fair value of each power plant acquired in the Energy Harbor Merger and the fair value of the contributed nuclear business was estimated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach was based on the discounted cash flow method, incorporating (i) our estimates of forecasted future growth and long-term prices of electricity, capacity, and nuclear fuel, and (ii) financial performance including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, taxes, working capital, and capital asset requirements. Projected cash flows were then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, along with any risks unique to the subject cash flows. These estimates are subjective in nature and require judgment to interpret market data. The market valuation method utilized prices paid for reasonably similar assets by other purchasers in the relevant market, with adjustments relating to physical differences in the asset as well as their locations.\nSee \nAsset Retirement Obligations (ARO)\n critical accounting estimate for methodology and assumptions used to estimate the nuclear decommissioning ARO acquired in the Energy Harbor Merger.\nDerivative Instruments and Mark-to-Market Accounting\nWe enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of energy-related commodities, as well as other derivative instruments such as options, swaps, futures, and forwards, primarily to manage commodity price and interest rate risks. Under accounting standards related to derivative instruments and hedging activities, these instruments are subject to mark-to-market accounting, and the determination of market values for these instruments is based on numerous assumptions and estimation techniques.\nMark-to-market accounting recognizes changes in the fair value of derivative instruments in the financial statements as market prices change. Such changes in fair value are accounted for as unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses in net income with an offset to derivative assets and liabilities. The availability of quoted market prices in energy markets is dependent on the type of commodity (e.g., natural gas, electricity, etc.), time period specified and delivery point. Where quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is based on unobservable inputs, which require significant judgment. Derivative instruments valued based on unobservable inputs primarily include (i) forward sales and purchases of electricity (including certain retail contracts), natural gas and coal, (ii) electricity, natural gas and coal options, and (iii) financial transmission rights. In computing fair value for derivatives, each forward pricing curve is separated into liquid and illiquid periods. The liquid period varies by delivery point and commodity. Generally, the liquid period is supported by exchange markets, broker quotes and frequent trading activity. For illiquid periods, fair value is estimated based on forward price curves developed using proprietary modeling techniques that take into account available market information and other inputs that might not be readily observable in the market. Any significant changes to these inputs could result in a material change to the value of the assets or liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets and could result in a material change to the unrealized gains or losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting standards related to derivative instruments and hedging activities allow for normal purchase or sale elections, which generally eliminate the requirement for mark-to-market recognition in net income. Normal purchases and sales (NPNS) are contracts that provide for physical delivery of quantities expected to be used or sold over a reasonable period in the normal course of business and are accounted for on an accrual basis. Determining whether a contract qualifies for the normal purchase or sale election requires judgment as to whether or not the contract will physically deliver and requires that management ensure compliance with all associated qualification and documentation requirements. If it is determined that a transaction designated as a normal purchase or sale no longer meets the scope exception, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with immediate recognition through earnings.\nSee Notes 11 and 12 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n57\nTable of Contents\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense and related consolidated balance sheet amounts involve significant management estimates and judgments. Amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as current and noncurrent accruals, involve estimates and judgments of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. Further, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize or utilize our deferred tax assets. If realization is not more likely than not, we would record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to utilize, which would reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax amounts. When evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including the following:\n•\nthe creation and timing of future income associated with the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets;\n•\nthe existence, or lack thereof, of statutory limitations on the period that net operating losses may be carried forward; and\n•\nthe amounts and history of income or losses, adjusted for certain non-recurring items.\nActual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, our forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods, as well as final review of filed tax returns by taxing authorities.\nIncome tax returns are regularly subject to examination by applicable tax authorities. In management's opinion, the liability recorded pursuant to income tax accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions reflects future taxes that may be owed as a result of any examination.\nSee Notes 1 and 5 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations (ARO)\nAn ARO liability is initially recorded at fair value when it is initially incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. In estimating the ARO liability, we are required to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our ARO liabilities primarily relate to nuclear generation plant decommissioning, land reclamation related to lignite mining, and remediation or closure of coal ash basins. On the Merger Date, we recognized ARO liabilities for the Beaver Valley, Perry and Davis-Besse nuclear plants acquired from Energy Harbor.\nFor the estimates and assumptions of the nuclear generation plant decommissioning, we use unit-by-unit decommissioning cost studies to provide a marketplace assessment of the expected costs and estimates of the timing of decommissioning activities, which are validated by comparison to current decommissioning projects within the industry and other estimates. We consider the following decommissioning scenarios: (i) DECON, which assumes major decommissioning activities begin shortly after the facility ceases operations, and (ii) SAFSTOR, which assumes the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in a condition during decommissioning that allows the nuclear facility to be safely stored until subsequently decontaminated within 60 years after the facility ceases operations. Decommissioning cost studies are updated for each of our nuclear units at least every five years unless circumstances warrant a more frequent update. In estimating the liability assumed in the Energy Harbor Merger, we have included an assumption that Vistra receives a license extension of 20 years from the NRC to continue to operate the Perry Nuclear Plant through 2046.\nThe estimates and assumptions required for the lignite mining land reclamation include, estimates such as costs to fill in mining pits and interpretation of the mining permit closure requirements. We estimate the costs to fill in mining pits utilizing a  proprietary model to determine the volume of the pit.\nOur AROs are adjusted on a regular basis to reflect the passage of time and to incorporate revisions to estimates and judgments including, planned plant retirement dates, amounts and timing of future cash expenditures, discount rates, cost escalation factors, market risk premiums, inflation rates, and if applicable, experience with government regulators regarding similar obligations.\nSee Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n58\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives\nGoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, such as the intangible asset related to the our retail trade names are not amortized and are subject to impairment testing annually, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed its fair value. Evaluating goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives involves applying significant assumptions including discount rates, forecasted results for the applicable reporting unit and retail trade name, market multiples, and growth rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nAccounting standards allow a company to qualitatively assess if the carrying value of a reporting unit with goodwill and retail trade name intangible asset is more likely than not less than the fair value. If the entity determines the carrying value is not more likely greater than the fair value, no further testing for impairment is required. On the most recent testing date, we performed a qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units and retail trade names exceeded their carrying value. Significant qualitative factors were evaluated included reporting unit and trade name financial performance, market multiples, general macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, cost factors, customer attrition, and interest rates. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite lives) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment for our generation facilities include an expectation of continuing long-term declines in natural gas prices and/or Market Heat Rates, an expectation that \"more likely than not\" a generation asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life, or additional environmental regulations significantly decrease the cash flows expected from the associated assets. The determination of the existence of these and other indications of impairment involves judgments that are subjective in nature and may require the use of estimates in forecasting future results and cash flows given the diverse fuel mix and output rates of our generation asset groups. See Note 20 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nAfter identifying an indicator of impairment, recoverability of long-lived assets is determined by a comparison of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group to the net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. Assumptions used in our estimate of net cash flows of the asset group include, forward natural gas and electricity prices, forward capacity prices, the effects of enacted environmental rules, generation plant performance, forecasted capital expenditures, forecasted fuel prices, and forecasted operating costs. The carrying value of such asset groups is determined to be unrecoverable if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value.\nIf an asset group carrying value is determined to be unrecoverable, fair value will be calculated based on a market participant view and a loss will be recorded for the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Fair value is determined primarily by discounted cash flows (income approach) and supported by available market valuations, if applicable. The income approach involves estimates of future performance that reflect assumptions regarding, among other things, forward electricity prices, forward capacity prices, Market Heat Rates, the effects of enacted environmental rules, generation plant performance, forecasted capital expenditures, forecasted fuel prices, and the discount rate applied to the forecasted cash flows. Any significant change to one or more of these factors can have a material impact on the fair value measurement of our long-lived assets.\nNuclear PTC Revenues\nNuclear PTC revenues are accounted for by analogy to the grant model within International Accounting Standards 20, \nAccounting for Government Grants and Disclosures of Government Assistance. \nNuclear PTC revenues are based on annual gross receipts generated from qualifying nuclear production in the calendar year. Treasury regulations are expected to further provide interpretive guidance on the definition of gross receipts over the next year. Given the lack of guidance to date, we recognized 2024 nuclear PTC revenues based on our best estimate and interpretation of gross receipts which includes settled spot energy revenues and capacity revenues at each nuclear unit, and excludes any hedges. Any interpretive guidance on the definition of gross receipts which differs from the interpretation used in our estimate could result in a material change to PTC revenues attributable to 2024 and would be reflected as a change in estimate in the period in which the guidance is received.\n59\nTable of Contents\nWe have determined that we will meet the prevailing wage requirements at all our nuclear units and are eligible for the five times multiplier, which is reflected in the amount of nuclear PTC revenue recognized in 2024.\nResults of Operations\nNet income increased $1.32 billion to Net income of $2.812 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. For additional information see the following discussion of our results of operations.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nIn analyzing and planning for our business, we supplement our use of GAAP financial measures with non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as performance measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed (i) with our GAAP results and (ii) the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures that management uses to allocate resources, determine our ability to fund capital expenditures, assess performance against our peers, and evaluate overall financial performance, we believe they provide useful information for investors.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures and are, by definition, an incomplete understanding of Vistra and must be considered in conjunction with GAAP measures. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. We strongly encourage investors to review the consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\nWhen EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA is discussed in reference to performance on a consolidated basis, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is Net income (loss).\nVistra Consolidated Financial Results — Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nThe following table presents Net income (loss), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nRetail\nTexas\nEast\nWest\nAsset \nClosure\nEliminations / Corporate and Other\nVistra Consolidated\n(in millions)\nOperating revenues\n$\n12,797 \n$\n5,394 \n$\n5,661 \n$\n877 \n$\n1 \n$\n(7,506)\n$\n17,224 \nFuel, purchased power costs, and delivery fees\n(10,276)\n(1,596)\n(2,698)\n(221)\n(3)\n7,509 \n(7,285)\nOperating costs\n(159)\n(996)\n(1,103)\n(72)\n(81)\n(3)\n(2,414)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(114)\n(581)\n(996)\n(86)\n— \n(66)\n(1,843)\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\n(977)\n(169)\n(148)\n(25)\n(43)\n(239)\n(1,601)\nOperating income (loss)\n1,271 \n2,052 \n716 \n473 \n(126)\n(305)\n4,081 \nOther income\n1 \n39 \n181 \n3 \n16 \n72 \n312 \nOther deductions\n(2)\n(4)\n(4)\n(6)\n(2)\n(3)\n(21)\nInterest expense and related charges\n(54)\n46 \n9 \n1 \n(4)\n(898)\n(900)\nImpacts of Tax Receivable Agreement\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n(5)\n(5)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n1,216 \n2,133 \n902 \n471 \n(116)\n(1,139)\n3,467 \nIncome tax expense\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n(655)\n(655)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n1,216\n \n$\n2,133\n \n$\n902\n \n$\n471\n \n$\n(116)\n$\n(1,794)\n$\n2,812\n \nIncome tax expense\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n655 \n655 \nInterest expense and related charges (a)\n54 \n(46)\n(9)\n(1)\n4 \n898 \n900 \nDepreciation and amortization (b)\n114 \n686 \n1,278 \n86 \n— \n66 \n2,230 \nEBITDA before Adjustments\n1,384 \n2,773 \n2,171 \n556 \n(112)\n(175)\n6,597 \n60\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nRetail\nTexas\nEast\nWest\nAsset \nClosure\nEliminations / Corporate and Other\nVistra Consolidated\nUnrealized net (gain) loss resulting from commodity hedging transactions\n52 \n(790)\n(76)\n(332)\n(9)\n— \n(1,155)\nPurchase accounting impacts\n— \n1 \n(12)\n— \n— \n(14)\n(25)\nImpacts of Tax Receivable Agreement (c)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n(5)\n(5)\nNon-cash compensation expenses\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n100 \n100 \nTransition and merger expenses\n2 \n1 \n22 \n— \n— \n111 \n136 \nDecommissioning-related activities (d)\n— \n26 \n(91)\n2 \n— \n— \n(63)\nERP system implementation expenses\n8 \n7 \n5 \n1 \n2 \n— \n23 \nOther, net\n17 \n14 \n(2)\n11 \n2 \n(111)\n(69)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,463\n \n$\n2,032\n \n$\n2,017\n \n$\n238\n \n$\n(117)\n$\n(94)\n$\n5,539\n \n____________\n(a)\nIncludes $53 million of unrealized mark-to-market net gains on interest rate swaps.\n(b)\nIncludes nuclear fuel amortization of $105 million and $282 million, respectively, in the Texas and East segments.\n(c)\nIncludes $10 million gain recognized on the repurchase of TRA Rights in the year ended December 31, 2024.\n(d)\nRepresents net of all NDT (income) loss of the PJM nuclear facilities, ARO accretion expense for operating assets and ARO remeasurement impacts for operating assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Texas and East segments include nuclear PTC revenue estimates of $281 million and $264 million, respectively.

While settled power prices in 2024 are lower than historical averages, the strategic hedging allowed us to lock in margins above what we would have been able to realize if unhedged and are higher than the margins from hedging for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is driving the increase in realized revenue net of fuel in the generation segments along with the addition of Energy Harbor. The forward power sales are also the drivers of the changes in unrealized gains/losses on hedging activities. As power prices increase/decrease in comparison to what our generation segments have sold forward, the generation segments recognize unrealized losses/gains. The retail segment procures power from the generation segments to serve future load obligations and thus changes in forward power prices have an inverse effect on unrealized mark to market for the retail segment as compared to the generation segments. In 2024, we saw a decrease in forward power prices in all our generation segments compared to our hedged positions which drove material unrealized gains in those segments, partially offset by unrealized losses in our retail segment. In 2023, the non-Texas generation segments also experienced a decrease in forward power prices compared to our hedged positions, which resulted in unrealized gains in those segments partially offset by unrealized losses in our retail segment. In the Texas segment, forward power prices materially increased in the year ended December 31, 2023, which resulted in unrealized losses partially offset by unrealized gains in the Retail segment.\nThe table below summarizes the changes in commodity contract assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The net change in these assets and liabilities, excluding \"other activity\" as described below, reflects $1.155 billion and $490 million in unrealized net gains for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, arising from mark-to-market accounting for positions in the commodity contract portfolio.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nCommodity contract net liability as of January 1\n$\n(2,740)\n$\n(3,148)\nSettlements/termination of positions (a)\n1,213 \n1,643 \nChanges in fair value of positions in the portfolio (b)\n(58)\n(1,153)\nAcquired commodity contracts (c)\n(50)\n— \nOther activity (d)\n175 \n(82)\nCommodity contract net liability as of December 31\n$\n(1,460)\n$\n(2,740)\n____________\n(a)\nRepresents reversals of previously recognized unrealized gains and losses upon settlement/termination (offsets realized gains/(losses) recognized in the settlement period).

When natural gas prices are elevated or depressed, we continue to seek opportunities to manage our wholesale power price exposure through hedging activities, including forward wholesale and retail electricity sales.\nEstimated hedging levels for generation volumes in our Texas, East and West segments as of December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n2025\n2026\nNuclear/Renewable/Coal Generation:\nTexas\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nEast\n84 \n%\n55 \n%\nNatural Gas Generation:\nTexas\n100 \n%\n57 \n%\nEast\n100 \n%\n77 \n%\nWest\n100 \n%\n37 \n%\nFinancial Condition\nCash Flows\nOperating Cash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $4.563 billion and $5.453 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The unfavorable change of $890 million was primarily driven by $1.06 billion less of a decrease in net margin deposits (returns of cash deposits related to commodity contracts which support our hedging strategy) in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The unfavorable change in margin deposits is partially offset by an increase in cash from realized operating income primarily due to the addition of Energy Harbor.\nDepreciation and amortization\n — Depreciation and amortization expense, as reported as a reconciling adjustment in the consolidated statements of cash flows, exceeded the amount reported in the consolidated statements of operations by $788 million, $454 million, and $451 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. This difference represents amortization of nuclear fuel, which is reported as fuel costs in the consolidated statements of operations consistent with industry practice, as well as the amortization of intangible net assets and liabilities. These are reported under various other line items in the consolidated statements of operations, including operating revenues, fuel and purchased power costs, and delivery fees (see Note 7 to the Financial Statements).\n66\nTable of Contents\nInvesting Cash Flows\nCash used in investing activities totaled $5.276 billion and $2.145 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The increase of $1.31 billion was primarily driven by the $1.748 billion paid to Avenue and Nuveen in connection with the purchase of their noncontrolling interests in Vistra Vision and the $180 million of dividends we paid to them. These cash outflows were partially offset by an $890 million increase in net new borrowings, as detailed below.\nYear Ended December 31,\nIncrease (Decrease)\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nShare repurchases\n$\n(1,266)\n$\n(1,245)\n$\n(21)\nIssuances of long-term debt\n3,817 \n2,498 \n1,319 \nOther net long-term borrowings (repayments)\n(2,287)\n(33)\n(2,254)\nNet short-term borrowings (repayments)\n— \n(650)\n650 \nNet borrowings (repayments) under the accounts receivable financing facilities\n750 \n(425)\n1,175 \nDividends paid to common stockholders\n(305)\n(313)\n8 \nDividends paid to preferred stockholders\n(173)\n(150)\n(23)\nDividends paid to noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interest holders\n(180)\n— \n(180)\nPayment for acquisition of noncontrolling interest\n(1,748)\n— \n(1,748)\nTRA Repurchase and tender offer — return of capital\n(122)\n— \n(122)\nOther financing activity\n(90)\n24 \n(114)\nCash used in financing activities\n$\n(1,604)\n$\n(294)\n$\n(1,310)\nDebt Activity\nWe remain committed to a strong balance sheet and have continued to state our objective to reduce consolidated net leverage.

We plan to fund this upcoming principal payment using a combination of proceeds from the senior secured notes issued in December 2024 and cash on hand. Increases in interest rates have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, increased borrowing costs.\n67\nTable of Contents\nSee Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nAvailable Liquidity\nThe following table summarizes changes in available liquidity for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nChange\n(in millions)\nCash and cash equivalents (a)\n$\n1,188 \n$\n3,485 \n$\n(2,297)\nVistra Operations Credit Facilities — Revolving Credit Facility (b)\n2,162 \n1,213 \n949 \nVistra Operations — Commodity-Linked Facility (c)\n771 \n1,101 \n(330)\nTotal available liquidity (d)(e)\n$\n4,121 \n$\n5,799 \n$\n(1,678)\n____________\n(a)\nSee the consolidated statements of cash flows in the Financial Statements and \nCash Flows\n above for details of the decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2024. The decrease includes $3.1 billion that was used to fund the Energy Harbor Merger.\n(b)\nThe increase in availability for the year ended December 31, 2024 was driven by a $684 million decrease in letters of credit outstanding under the facility and the October 2024 amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility which, among other things, increased the revolving credit commitments by $265 million (see Note 9 to the Financial Statements).\n(c)\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the borrowing bases were less than the facility limits of $1.75 billion and $1.575 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, available capacity reflects the borrowing base of $771 million and no cash borrowings. As of December 31, 2023, available capacity reflects the borrowing base of $1.101 billion and no cash borrowings.\n(d)\nExcludes amounts available to be borrowed under the Receivables Facility and the Repurchase Facility, respectively. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n(e)\nExcludes any additional letters of credit that may be issued under the Secured LOC Facilities or the Alternative LOC Facilities. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nWe believe that we will have access to sufficient liquidity to fund our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months, including the upcoming payments associated with the acquisition of Nuveen's noncontrolling interest in Vistra Vision discussed in Note 9 to the Financial Statements. Our operational cash flows tend to be seasonal and weighted toward the second half of the year.\nInterest payments on long-term debt, after taking into account interest rate swaps, are expected to total approximately $905 million in 2025, $1.595 billion in 2026-2027, $1.180 billion in 2028-2029 and $1.305 billion thereafter. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nOur obligations under commodity purchase and services agreements, including capacity payments, nuclear fuel and natural gas take-or-pay contracts, coal contracts, business services and nuclear-related outsourcing and other purchase commitments, are expected to total approximately $3.270 billion in 2025, $2.650 billion in 2026-2027, $1.490 billion in 2028-2029 and $450 million thereafter. See Notes 10 and 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nCapital Expenditures\nEstimated 2025 capital expenditures and nuclear fuel purchases as of December 31, 2024 total approximately $2.275 billion and include:\n•\n$925 million for investments in generation and mining facilities;\n•\n$725 million for solar and energy storage development;\n•\n$300 million for nuclear fuel purchases; and\n•\n$325 million for other growth expenditures.\n68\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Effects of Commodity Hedging and Trading Activities\nWe have entered into commodity hedging and trading transactions that require us to post collateral if the forward price of the underlying commodity moves such that the hedging or trading instrument we hold has declined in value. We use cash, letters of credit, Eligible Assets (see Note 8 to the Financial Statements) and other forms of credit support to satisfy such collateral posting obligations. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nExchange cleared transactions typically require initial margin (\ni.e.\n, the upfront cash and/or letter of credit posted to take into account the size and maturity of the positions and credit quality) in addition to variation margin (\ni.e.\n, the daily cash margin posted to take into account changes in the value of the underlying commodity). The amount of initial margin required is generally defined by exchange rules. Clearing agents, however, typically have the right to request additional initial margin based on various factors, including market depth, volatility and credit quality, which may be in the form of cash, letters of credit, a guaranty or other forms as negotiated with the clearing agent. Cash collateral received from counterparties is either used for working capital and other business purposes, including reducing borrowings under credit facilities, or is required to be deposited in a separate account and restricted from being used for working capital and other corporate purposes. With respect to over-the-counter transactions, counterparties generally have the right to substitute letters of credit for such cash collateral. In such event, the cash collateral previously posted would be returned to such counterparties, which would reduce liquidity in the event the cash was not restricted.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we received or posted cash, letters of credit and Eligible Assets for commodity hedging and trading activities as follows:\n•\n$841 million in cash and Eligible Assets has been posted with counterparties as compared to $1.244 billion posted as of December 31, 2023;\n•\n$49 million in cash has been received from counterparties as compared to $45 million received as of December 31, 2023;\n•\n$2.560 billion in letters of credit have been posted with counterparties as compared to $2.408 billion posted as of December 31, 2023; and\n•\n$131 million in letters of credit have been received from counterparties as compared to $143 million received as of December 31, 2023.\nSee \nCollateral Support Obligations\n below for information related to collateral posted in accordance with the PUCT and ISO/RTO rules.\nIncome Tax Payments\nIn the next 12 months, we expect to make approximately $31 million in federal income tax payments, $81 million in state income tax payments and $2 million in TRA payments, offset by $14 million in state tax refunds.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, there were $5 million federal income tax payments, $59 million in state income tax payments, $9 million in state income tax refunds and no TRA payments.\nCapitalization\nOur capitalization ratios consisted of 73% and 70% long-term debt (less amounts due currently) and 27% and 30% stockholders' equity at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total long-term debt (including amounts due currently) to capitalization was 75% and 73% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n69\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Covenants\nThe Vistra Operations Credit Agreement and the Vistra Operations Commodity-Linked Credit Agreement each includes a covenant, solely with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Commodity-Linked Facility and solely during a compliance period (which, in general, is applicable when the aggregate revolving borrowings and revolving letters of credit outstanding (excluding all undrawn revolving letters of credit and cash collateralized backstopped revolving letters of credit) exceed 35% of the revolving commitments), that requires the consolidated first-lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 4.25 to 1.00 (or, during a collateral suspension period, the consolidated total net leverage ratio not to exceed 5.50 to 1.00). In addition, each of the Secured LOC Facilities includes a covenant that requires the consolidated first-lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 4.25 to 1.00 (or, for certain facilities that include a collateral suspension mechanism, during a collateral suspension period, the consolidated total net leverage ratio not to exceed 5.50 to 1.00). Although the period ended December 31, 2024 was not a compliance period, we would have been in compliance with the Vistra Operations Credit Agreement, Vistra Operations Commodity-Linked Credit Agreement and Secured LOC Facilities financial covenants if they were required to be tested at such time. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nCollateral Support Obligations\nThe RCT has rules in place to assure that parties can meet their mining reclamation obligations. In September 2016, the RCT agreed to a collateral bond of up to $975 million to support Luminant's reclamation obligations. The collateral bond is effectively a first lien on all of Vistra Operations' assets (which ranks pari passu with the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities) that contractually enables the RCT to be paid (up to $975 million) before the other first-lien lenders in the event of a liquidation of our assets. Collateral support relates to land mined or being mined and not yet reclaimed as well as land for which permits have been obtained but mining activities have not yet begun and land already reclaimed but not released from regulatory obligations by the RCT, and includes cost contingency amounts.\nThe PUCT has rules in place to assure adequate creditworthiness of each REP, including the ability to return customer deposits, if necessary. Under these rules, as of December 31, 2024, Vistra has posted letters of credit in the amount of $86 million with the PUCT, which is subject to adjustments.\nThe ISOs/RTOs we operate in have rules in place to assure adequate creditworthiness of parties that participate in the markets operated by those ISOs/RTOs. Under these rules, Vistra has posted collateral support totaling $960 million in the form of letters of credit, $70 million in the form of a surety bond and $3 million of cash as of December 31, 2024 (which is subject to daily adjustments based on settlement activity with the ISOs/RTOs).\nMaterial Cross Default/Acceleration Provisions\nCertain of our contractual arrangements contain provisions that could result in an event of default if there were a failure under financing arrangements to meet payment terms or to observe covenants that could result in an acceleration of payments due.
