MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis quarterly report contains “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those that express a plan, belief, expectation, estimation, anticipation, intent, contingency, future development, outlook, or similar expression, and can generally be identified as forward-looking because they include words such as “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “could,” “should,” “confident,” “likely,” “plan,” or words of similar meaning. Statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals are also forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements in this report involve significant risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors, both foreseen and unforeseen, could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. The factors that may affect our results include, among others, the following: our ability to compete effectively against new and existing competitors and to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; changes in customer demand for our products and services; the ability of our technology to keep pace with a rapidly evolving marketplace; the success of our merchant alliances, some of which we do not control; the impact of a security breach or operational failure on our business, including disruptions caused by other participants in the global financial system; losses due to chargebacks, refunds or returns as a result of fraud or the failure of our vendors and merchants to satisfy their obligations; changes in local, regional, national and international economic or political conditions, including those resulting from heightened inflation, rising interest rates, taxes, trade policies and tariffs, a recession, bank failures, or intensified international hostilities, and the impact they may have on us and our employees, clients, vendors, supply chain, operations and sales; the effect of proposed and enacted legislative and regulatory actions affecting us or the financial services industry as a whole; our ability to comply with government regulations and applicable card association and network rules; the protection and validity of intellectual property rights; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings; our ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, and to realize the anticipated benefits associated with the same; the impact of our growth strategies; our ability to successfully implement the One Fiserv action plan; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; adverse impacts from currency exchange rates or currency controls; changes in corporate tax and interest rates; and other factors identified in “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and in other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available at http://www.sec.gov. You should consider these factors carefully in evaluating forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations.

Most of the products and services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are therefore non-discretionary in nature. We serve our global client base by working among our geographic teams across various regions, including the United States of America (“U.S.”) and Canada; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; and Asia Pacific.\nWe move more than money, with a purpose to deliver superior value for our clients through leading technology, targeted innovation and excellence in everything we do.

Our long-term focus is to meet our financial commitments; continue to build high-quality revenue; deepen client relationships with an emphasis on digital solutions and value-added services; deliver innovation and integration enabling differentiated value for our clients; and generate integration value, including cost and revenue synergies from acquisitions.\nThe businesses in our Merchant Solutions (“Merchant”) segment provide commerce-enabling products and services to companies of all sizes around the world. These products and services include merchant acquiring and digital commerce services; mobile payment services; security and fraud protection solutions; stored-value solutions; software-as-a-service; POS devices; and pay-by-bank solutions.

We expect to acquire businesses when we identify: a compelling strategic need, such as a product, service or technology that helps meet client demand; a way to achieve business scale that enables competition and operational efficiency; or similar considerations. We expect to divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies. The results of operations for the following acquired businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition.\nAcquisitions of Businesses\nOn March 2, 2025, we acquired Payfare, Inc. (“Payfare”), a provider of program management solutions powering instant access to earnings and banking solutions for workforces. Payfare is included within the Financial segment and expands our embedded finance capabilities for large enterprises and financial institutions. On March 18, 2025, we acquired CCV Group B.V. (“CCV”), a supplier of POS payment solutions. CCV is included within the Merchant segment and expands our network of payment \n32\nTable of Contents\n                                  \n \nsolutions, enabling our ability to accelerate the deployment of our Clover\n®\n POS and business management platform across Europe. On April 4, 2025, we acquired Pinch Payments NZ Limited (together with Zootive Pty Ltd, “Pinch Payments”), a payment facilitator. Pinch Payments is included within the Merchant segment and expands our flexible payment services for our partners and clients, and presence within the Asia-Pacific region. On June 4, 2025, we acquired Money Money Serviços Financeiros S.A. (“Money Money”), a provider of risk analysis and credit decisioning solutions. Money Money is included within the Merchant segment and expands our payment and financial service capabilities, enabling access to working capital and other payment solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. On September 4, 2025, we acquired CardFree Inc. (“CardFree”), an all-in-one platform delivering integrated order, payment and loyalty solutions for merchants. CardFree is included within the Merchant segment and further expands the capabilities of our Clover\n®\n platform across the hospitality, restaurant and lodging industries. On September 25, 2025, we acquired the Smith Consulting Group, LLC business (“SCG”), an operational consulting service utilized by community banks and credit unions across the U.S. SCG is included within the Financial segment and supports our ability to provide consultative engagement to enhance community banks’ and credit unions’ strategic investments.\nWe acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price, including deferred payments, of $397 million, net of $73 million of acquired cash and including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $27 million.\nOn September 26, 2025, we entered into definitive agreements to acquire StoneCastle Cash Management, LLC, INDX Processing, LLC and StoneCastle Trust Co. (collectively, “StoneCastle”). StoneCastle enables its network of depository institutions to easily access stable, cost-efficient deposit funding. StoneCastle will be included within the Financial segment and enables us to become a technology-enabled source of institutional deposits, helping financial institutions strengthen their balance sheets. This transaction is expected to close by the first quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. On October 1, 2025, we acquired a portion of The Toronto-Dominion Bank’s (“TD Bank”) merchant processing business in Canada. This business will be included within the Merchant segment and expands the footprint of our Clover\n®\n platform. In connection with this transaction, we signed a multi-year strategic managed services program agreement with TD Bank to utilize our technology, including Clover\n®\n, within the TD Bank Merchant Solutions business. We expect to acquire these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $460 million.\nOther Transactions\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) provided us with a notice of non-renewal for the Wells Fargo Merchant Services merchant alliance (“WFMS”), which was accounted for as an equity method investment. Upon the expiration of the joint venture on April 1, 2025, we received an initial cash payment of $453 million. Completion of the contractual valuation and separation process during the third quarter of 2025 did not result in a significant adjustment to the initial cash payment received. In connection with the non-renewal of WFMS, we entered into a multi-year agreement with Wells Fargo to provide processing for current and future merchant clients as well as other services to Wells Fargo’s merchant business.\nOn April 17, 2025, we acquired the remaining 19% ownership interest in ICICI Merchant Services Private Limited, a merchant acceptance business, for $22 million. We previously held a majority controlling financial interest in this subsidiary, which continues to be consolidated and reported within the Merchant segment. On September 5, 2025, we acquired the remaining 49.9% ownership interest, including cash held of $195 million, in AIB Merchant Services (“AIBMS”), a payments solution provider, for $420 million. We previously held a majority controlling financial interest in this subsidiary, which continues to be consolidated and reported within the Merchant segment.\nIndustry Trends\nThe global payments landscape continues to evolve, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, e-commerce and real-time payments infrastructure. Because of this growth, competition also continues to intensify. Business and consumer expectations continue to rise, with a focus on speed, convenience, choice and security. To meet these expectations, payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology, expanding the use of data and enhancing the customer experience.\nMerchants\nThe rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and e-commerce, driven by consumers’ desire for simpler, more efficient shopping experiences, has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers nearly anywhere, through any device, which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments. Merchants are demanding simpler, integrated and flexible systems to enable them to serve customers and help manage cash flow and everyday business operations. When combined with the ever-increasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services, merchants have sought modern end-to-end solutions throughout their growth lifecycle to streamline the complexity. Furthermore, merchants can \n33\nTable of Contents\n                                  \n \nnow search, discover, compare, purchase and even install a new system through direct, digital-only experiences. This direct, digital-only channel is a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities, especially with respect to smaller merchants.\nAdditionally, there are numerous software-as-a-service solution providers in the industry, many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring into their software as a way to generate revenue from existing client relationships. Such providers are independent software vendors, typically referred to as ISVs, and we believe there are numerous potential distribution partnership opportunities to cross-sell multiple value-added solutions available to us.\nWe believe that our merchant acquiring products and solutions create compelling value propositions for merchant clients of all sizes, from small and mid-sized businesses to medium-sized regional businesses to global enterprise merchants. The depth and breadth of our omnichannel solutions, and flexibility to serve clients across various channels and geographies, drives higher product attach rates with new and existing clients across all verticals. Furthermore, we believe that our strength in distribution, our progress growing software and services, and our value-based pricing as we continue to invest in our operating systems, gives us a solid foundation for growth.\nFinancial Institutions\nFinancial services providers regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, risk management, lending and investment products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. These conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. In addition, the focus on the customer experience, including through mobile and online engagement, by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions. \nFinancial institutions must be able to serve their customers with tailored solutions, delivered how and when those customers want. In addition, financial institutions are striving for a single, integrated view of a customer’s activity. This requires financial institutions to not only process customer transactions, but to integrate financial institutions’ products and services to give customers easy access to integrated solutions. We believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. We have invested in integrating our platforms and value-added solutions to make it easy for a client to buy across our full product suite.\nWe expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environmental shift from traditional to digital banking. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including a unified, seamless customer experience across mobile and online channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. \nOur focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations transfer accounts among financial institutions. If a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition, we typically receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. We believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our value-added software and services-led model, and our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth.\nOur customers can use multiple solutions that span our merchant and financial institutions offerings. Our Merchant and Financial businesses put us at the intersection of commerce and banking, which allows these businesses to work together and create long-term growth opportunities for all parties.\nRecent Market Conditions\nGlobal macroeconomic conditions, including changing interest rates, inflation, disruptions in the global supply chain, changes in consumer spending, the effects of international hostilities, political conditions, regulations restricting trade or impacting our ability to offer products or services, and trade policies and tariffs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A decline in personal consumption and consumer savings in the U.S. may also negatively impact our business and financial results. We actively monitor and manage our business in response to these unpredictable geopolitical and market conditions, as they may adversely impact our operations and financial results.\n34\nTable of Contents\n                                  \n \nIn addition, our operating results in certain foreign countries in which we operate may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates for currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, British Pound, Indian Rupee, Brazilian Real and Argentine Peso. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies in countries in which we operate would negatively impact our revenue and earnings. We also have exposure to risks related to currency devaluation in certain countries, which may negatively impact our international operating results if there is a prolonged devaluation of local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar or if the economic conditions in these countries decline. While the majority of our revenue is earned in the U.S., we actively monitor the interest rate and foreign exchange rate environment and may enter into derivative instruments and utilize other non-derivative hedging instruments with creditworthy institutions in an effort to manage these risks.\nOne Fiserv Action Plan\nIn the third quarter of 2025, we launched a multi-year transformation program, which we refer to as the One Fiserv action plan, designed to prioritize and enhance client focus across five strategic pillars. The One Fiserv action plan is designed to center our investments in areas that build on Fiserv’s strengths, including: operating with a client-first mindset to win new enterprise clients and grow average revenue per client; building the pre-eminent small business operating platform through Clover\n®\n;\n creating differentiated, innovative platforms in finance and commerce, including embedded finance and stablecoin; delivering operational excellence enabled by artificial intelligence (“AI”); and employing disciplined capital allocation for the long-term. This action plan involves using emerging technology, including generative and agentic AI, to enhance our solutions, modernize our gateways and orchestration layers, facilitate embedded finance, and improve our operations.\nChanges in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, we identified our critical accounting policies and estimates. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. For example, we estimate the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions of businesses and may record purchase accounting adjustments during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date.  Additionally, we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The unaudited financial results presented below have been affected by acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, net gain on sales and distribution of other assets, and foreign currency fluctuations.\n35\nTable of Contents\n                                  \n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nPercentage of\nRevenue \n(1)\nIncrease (Decrease)\n(In

segment. Total revenue increased $704 million, or 5%, in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024, with 7% growth in our Merchant segment and 3% growth in our Financial segment.\nRevenue in our Merchant segment increased $117 million, or 5%, in the third quarter of 2025 and increased $470 million, or 7%, in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. Small Business contributed 5% to Merchant segment revenue growth in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, primarily driven by our Clover POS and business management platform, including increased payment volumes and the expansion of our merchant relationships through value-added services in both periods. Additionally, Enterprise contributed 1% to Merchant segment revenue growth in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, primarily driven by transaction growth, as well as an increase in data and analytics sales in both periods. A decrease in Processing’s revenue partially offset Merchant segment revenue growth in the third quarter of 2025.\nRevenue in our Financial segment decreased $79 million, or 3%, in the third quarter of 2025 and increased $226 million, or 3%, in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. A decrease in license and termination fee revenue of $49 million, primarily within Banking and Digital Payments, negatively impacted Financial segment revenue by 2% in the third quarter of 2025. The remaining decrease in the third quarter of 2025 was due to lower processing revenue within Digital Payments. The 3% increase in Financial segment revenue in the first nine months of 2025 was driven by an increase in data and analytics sales and license revenue within Digital Payments and Issuing.\nRevenue at Corporate and Other increased $10 million in the third quarter of 2025 and increased $8 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024, due to increased postage revenue in both periods.\nTotal Expenses\nTotal expenses increased $214 million, or 6%, in the third quarter of 2025 and increased $388 million, or 4%, in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024.

Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue in the third quarter of 2025 were negatively impacted by higher residual payments to channel partners of approximately 150 basis points; higher data processing costs of approximately 150 basis points; and an increase in severance, acquisition and integration related expenses of approximately 70 basis points. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue in the first nine months of 2025 were favorably impacted by a reduction in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of approximately 90 basis points, partially offset by higher residual payments to channel partners. Total \n38\nTable of Contents\n                                  \n \nexpenses as a percentage of total revenue in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 were also favorably impacted by an $89 million gain related to the distribution of certain merchant contracts for the redemption of a minority partner’s membership interest.\nCost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue increased to 34.8% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 31.8% in the third quarter of 2024 and increased to 34.0% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 32.7% in the first nine months of 2024. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 was impacted by a lower level of processing revenue growth and higher data processing costs.\nCost of product as a percentage of product revenue increased to 68.6% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 67.6% in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased to 62.6% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 69.0% in the first nine months of 2024. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was relatively consistent in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024, and decreased in the first nine months of 2025 due to an increase in high margin data and analytics sales and license revenue.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 33.5% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 30.8% in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased to 32.4% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 32.9% in the first nine months of 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily impacted by higher residual payments to channel partners of approximately 150 basis points and an increase in severance, acquisition and integration related expenses of approximately 70 basis points, along with various other slight increases. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in the first nine months of 2025 was impacted by a reduction in amortization of acquisition related-intangible assets of approximately 90 basis points, partially offset by higher residual payments to channel partners.\nThe net gain on sales and distribution of other assets in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 includes an $89 million gain related to the distribution of certain merchant contracts for the redemption of a minority partner’s membership interest.\nOperating Income and Operating Margin\nTotal operating income decreased $166 million, or 10%, in the third quarter of 2025 and increased $316 million, or 8%, in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024.

Operating margin decreased in our Merchant segment in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 primarily due to higher residual payments to channel partners and data processing costs. Operating income in the Merchant segment benefited from a gain of $89 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 related to the distribution of certain merchant contracts for the redemption of a minority partner’s membership interest.\nOperating income in our Financial segment decreased $152 million, or 13%, in the third quarter of 2025 and increased $139 million, or 4%, in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. Operating margin decreased 490 basis points to 42.5% in the third quarter of 2025 and increased 50 basis points to 46.3% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. The decreases in operating income and operating margin in our Financial segment in the third quarter of 2025 were primarily due to a decrease in high margin license revenue, along with higher data processing costs. Operating income and operating margin growth in our Financial segment in the first nine months of 2025 were primarily due to an increase in high margin data and analytics sales and license revenue.\nThe operating loss in Corporate and Other increased $45 million in the third quarter of 2025 and decreased $73 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. The operating loss in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily impacted by increased severance, acquisition and integration related expenses of $37 million.

Interest expense, net was also impacted by an increase in borrowing costs from higher interest rates in Argentina in the third quarter of 2025.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net increased $45 million in the third quarter of 2025 and increased $90 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. Other expense, net includes the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities for subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies, gains or losses from a sale or change in fair value of investments in certain equity securities, and amounts related to debt guarantee arrangements of certain joint ventures. The remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in highly inflationary economies, including Argentina, resulted in foreign currency exchange losses of $53 million and $22 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and $117 million and $75 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Other expense, net in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 included $2 million and $29 million, respectively, related to gains on the sale and remeasurement of certain equity securities.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes and income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was 17.9% and 5.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and 18.4% and 13.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rate for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 included discrete tax benefits from equity compensation, resulting in a lower effective income tax rate compared to the statutory income tax rate. The effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a deferred tax benefit of $142 million recorded within the income tax provision associated with a non-cash impairment charge of $570 million recorded within income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates.\nIncome (Loss) from Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\nOur share of income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates accounted for using the equity method is reported as income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and the related tax benefit is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. Income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including non-cash impairment charges and acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $8 million and $(626) million in the third quarter of 2025 and 2024, and $(16) million and $(642) million in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. The third quarter and first nine months of 2024 included a $570 million non-cash impairment related to the Wells Fargo Merchant Services merchant alliance. \nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interest relates to the minority partners’ share of the net income in our consolidated subsidiaries. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $7 million in both the third quarter of 2025 and 2024, and $8 million and $39 million in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Effective June 2024, we mutually agreed to terminate a joint venture agreement with a merchant alliance joint venture minority partner, resulting in lower net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the first nine months of 2025.\nNet Income Per Share – Diluted \nNet income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. per share-diluted was $1.46 and $0.98 in the third quarter of 2025 and 2024, and $4.83 and $3.74 in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. In addition to the impacts to net income attributable to Fiserv, Inc. described above, our diluted weighted average outstanding shares were reduced by 6% in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, due to our share repurchase program.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness, including finance lease and other financing obligations; and (iii) fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied in both the short and long term \n40\nTable of Contents\n                                  \n \nusing cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion, proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper, and available capacity under our revolving credit facility of $3.4 billion (net of $4.6 billion of capacity designated for outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs, senior notes due within the next twelve months and letters of credit) at September 30, 2025.\nThe following table summarizes our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow, and capital expenditures:\n \nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nIncrease (Decrease)\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\nNet income\n$\n2,677 \n$\n2,232 \n$\n445 \nDepreciation and amortization\n2,392 \n2,370 \n22 \nShare-based compensation\n302 \n273 \n29 \nDeferred income taxes\n(589)\n(539)\n(50)\nNet gain on sales and distribution of other assets\n(117)\n— \n(117)\nLoss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates\n16 \n642 \n(626)\nDistributions from unconsolidated affiliates\n34 \n29 \n5 \nNet changes in working capital and other\n(597)\n(597)\n— \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n4,118 \n$\n4,410 \n$\n(292)\n(7)\n%\nCapital expenditures, including capitalized software and other intangibles\n$\n1,321 \n$\n1,170 \n$\n151 \n13 \n%\nOur operating cash flow was $4.1 billion in the first nine months of 2025, a decrease of 7% compared with $4.4 billion in the first nine months of 2024. The decrease was primarily attributed to lower cash conversion on profitability. \nOur current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, merchant cash advances, share repurchases, acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Net merchant cash advances, primarily associated with our operations in Latin America, were $614 million during the first nine months of 2025. These cash advances are funded through a combination of operating cash and various short-term lines of credit. Our capital expenditures were approximately 8% of our total revenue for both the first nine months of 2025 and 2024.\nShare Repurchases\nWe repurchased 29.1 million shares of our common stock for $5.4 billion and 27.8 million shares of our common stock for $4.3 billion during the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. On February 19, 2025, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 60.0 million of our common stock. As of September 30, 2025, we had approximately 48.9 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.

We funded these acquisitions by utilizing a combination of available cash and commercial paper. The results of operations for these acquired businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition.\nIn September 2025, we entered into definitive agreements to acquire StoneCastle, which transaction is expected to close by the first quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. In October 2025, we acquired a portion of TD Bank’s merchant processing business in Canada. We expect to acquire these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $460 million. We funded the TD Bank transaction and intend to fund the acquisition of StoneCastle by utilizing a combination of available cash and commercial paper.\nOther Transactions\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Wells Fargo provided us with a notice of non-renewal for WFMS. Upon the expiration of the joint venture in April 2025, we received an initial cash payment of $453 million. Completion of the contractual valuation and \n41\nTable of Contents\n                                  \n \nseparation process during the third quarter of 2025 did not result in a significant adjustment to the initial cash payment received. \nIn April 2025, we acquired the remaining 19% ownership interest in ICICI Merchant Services Private Limited for $22 million. We previously held a majority controlling financial interest in this consolidated subsidiary and funded this transaction with available cash. In September 2025, we acquired the remaining 49.9% ownership interest, including cash held of $195 million, in AIBMS for $420 million.

Outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper programs are also classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as we have the intent to refinance this commercial paper on a long-term basis through the continued issuance of new commercial paper upon maturity, and also have the ability to refinance such commercial paper under our revolving credit facility.\nVariable Rate Debt\nOur variable rate debt consisted of the following at September 30, 2025:\n(In millions)\nMaturity\nWeighted-Average Interest Rate\nOutstanding Borrowings\nForeign lines of credit\nvarious\n36.887%\n$\n876 \nU.S. dollar commercial paper notes\nvarious\n4.301%\n1,238 \nEuro commercial paper notes\nvarious\n2.135%\n1,310 \nTotal variable rate debt\n11.800%\n$\n3,424 \nWe maintain various short-term lines of credit and other borrowing arrangements with foreign banks and alliance partners primarily to fund merchant settlement advances associated with operations in Latin America.

Outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs bear interest based on the prevailing rates at the time of issuance.\nIn August 2025, we entered into a new senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility with substantially the same syndicate of banks that were lenders under our prior revolving credit facility, which we voluntarily terminated and replaced. The new credit facility matures in August 2030 and provides for a maximum aggregate principal amount of availability of $8.0 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable base rate, determined by the term and currency of the borrowing, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2025. We are required to pay a facility fee based on the aggregate commitments in effect under the credit agreement from time to time.\nDebt Covenants and Compliance\nThe indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. We may, at our option, redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at the applicable redemption price.\nThe revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to, among other things, limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.75 times our consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and expenses and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions.\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants. Our ability to meet future debt covenant requirements will depend on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows. We expect to remain in compliance with all terms and conditions associated with our outstanding debt, including financial debt covenants.\nDebt Guarantees\nWe maintain noncontrolling ownership interests in Sagent M&C, LLC and defi SOLUTIONS Group, LLC (collectively, the “Lending Joint Ventures”). The Lending Joint Ventures maintain variable-rate term loan facilities with aggregate outstanding borrowings of $404 million in senior unsecured debt at September 30, 2025 and variable-rate revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $83 million with a syndicate of banks, which mature in April 2027. There were $21 million of aggregate outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities at September 30, 2025. We have guaranteed the debt of the Lending Joint Ventures. We maintained a liability of $14 million at September 30, 2025 for the estimated fair value of our non-contingent obligations to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee arrangements. Such guarantees will be amortized in future periods over the contractual term of the debt. In addition, we maintained a contingent liability of $8 million at September 30, 2025, representing the current expected credit losses to which we are exposed. This contingent liability is estimated based on certain financial metrics of the Lending Joint Ventures and historical industry data, which is used to develop assumptions of the likelihood the guaranteed parties will default and the level of credit losses in the event a default occurs. We have not made any payments under the guarantees, nor have we been called upon to do so, and do not anticipate that the Lending Joint Ventures will fail to fulfill their debt obligations.\nSupplemental Guarantor Information\nFiserv, Inc. has fully, unconditionally and solely guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis the 2028 notes, 2032 notes and 2036 notes (the “Guaranteed Notes”) issued by Fiserv Funding Unlimited Company (the “Issuer”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Fiserv, Inc.
