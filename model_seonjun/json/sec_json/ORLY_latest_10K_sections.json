Business\n​\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n​\nUnless otherwise indicated, “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar terms, as well as references to the “Company,” refer to O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and its Subsidiaries.  O’Reilly is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States (“U.S.”), selling our products to both do-it-yourself (“DIY”) and professional service provider customers, our “dual market strategy.”  The business was founded in 1957 by Charles F. O’Reilly and his son, Charles H. “Chub’’ O’Reilly, Sr., and initially operated from a single store in Springfield, Missouri. Our common stock has traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ORLY” since April 22, 1993.\n​\nOn January 22, 2024, the Company completed the previously announced strategic acquisition of Groupe Del Vasto (“Vast Auto”), an auto parts supplier headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  At the time of the acquisition, Vast Auto operated two distribution centers and six satellite warehouses that support a network of 23 company-owned stores and thousands of independent jobber and professional customers across Eastern Canada.\n​\nAt December 31, 2024, we operated 6,265 stores in 48 states in the United States and Puerto Rico, 87 stores in Mexico, and 26 stores in Canada.  Our stores carry an extensive product line, including\n●\nnew and remanufactured automotive hard parts and maintenance items, such as alternators, batteries, brake system components, belts, chassis parts, driveline parts, engine parts, fuel pumps, hoses, starters, temperature control, water pumps, antifreeze, appearance products, engine additives, filters, fluids, lighting, oil, and wiper blades and\n●\naccessories, such as floor mats, seat covers, and truck accessories.\n​\nOur stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers, such as\n●\nbattery diagnostic testing;\n●\nbattery, wiper, and bulb replacement;\n●\ncheck engine light code extraction, with diagnostic information, list of possible repair fixes, and referrals to trusted local repair shops provided;\n●\ncustom hydraulic hoses;\n●\ndrum and rotor resurfacing;\n●\nelectrical and module testing;\n●\nloaner tool program;\n●\nprofessional paint shop mixing and related materials; and\n●\nused oil, oil filter, and battery recycling.\n​\nSee the “Risk Factors” section of this annual report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks relevant to our business.  These risk factors include, among others, risks related to deteriorating economic conditions; competition in the automotive aftermarket business; our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions; our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products; business interruptions; failure to protect our brand and reputation; risks associated with international operations; unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results; the volatility of the market price of our common stock; our increased debt levels; a downgrade in our credit ratings; information and systems security, damage, and failure; failure to achieve our growth objectives; our dependence upon key personnel; our acquisition success; and litigation, environmental legislation, and other regulations.\n​\nOUR BUSINESS\n​\nOur goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategies.  We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values, including hard work, superior customer service, and expense control.  Our mission is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both DIY and professional service provider customers.\n​\n5\n\n\n​\nCompetitive Advantages\n​\nWe believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, technically proficient store personnel, strategic distribution network, and experienced management Team make up our key competitive advantages, which cannot be easily duplicated. \n​\nProven Ability to Execute Our Dual Market Strategy:\nFor more than 45 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers.  We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage.  The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers, capitalizing on our existing store and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer national chain competitors, and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers.\n​\nIn 2024, we derived approximately 52% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 48% of our sales from our professional service provider customers.  Historically, we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to DIY customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business, which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation.  We believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business, due to our systems, knowledge, industry-leading parts availability, and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket, augmented by our approximately 810 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer.  We will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our DIY business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets.\n​\nSuperior Customer Service:\nWe seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products.  We believe the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the correct automotive products needed to complete their repairs.  Accordingly, each O’Reilly store carries, or has same or next day availability to, a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications.  We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates, and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace.  We have no material backorders for the products we sell.\n​\nWe seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are identified below:\n●\nsuperior in-store service through highly-motivated, technically-proficient store personnel (“Professional Parts People”);\n●\nan extensive selection and superior availability of products;\n●\nmany enhanced service programs, including battery and electrical testing, battery, wiper and bulb replacement, and check engine light code extractions with diagnostic support;\n●\nattractive stores in convenient locations;\n●\ncompetitive pricing, supported by a good, better, best product assortment designed to meet all of our customers’ quality and value preferences; \n●\na robust point-of-sale system integrated with our proprietary electronic catalog, which contains a wide variety of product images, schematics and technical specifications, and equips our Team Members with highly effective tools to source products in our extensive supply network;\n●\nonline ordering for our professional customers through our proprietary professional customer platforms, \nwww.OReillyPro.com\n and our O’Reilly Pro mobile application, with local delivery available; and \n●\nonline ordering, featuring “chat with a parts professional,” parts look up assistance for our DIY customers through our retail platform, \nwww.OReillyAuto.com\n, with convenient store locations for pick-up-in-store orders or home delivery.\n​\nTechnically Proficient Professional Parts People:\nOur highly-motivated, technically-proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators.  We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard part repairs, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service \n6\n\n\n​\nprovider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis.  Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People.  See our “Team Members and Human Capital Management” disclosure of the “Business” section of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about our technically proficient professional parts people.\n​\nStrategic Regional Tiered Distribution Network:\nWe believe our commitment to a robust, regional, tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network.  Our strategic, regional, tiered distribution network includes distribution centers (“DCs”) and Hub stores.  Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management.  We currently operate 31 DCs, which typically provides our stores with same-day or overnight access to over 153,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers.  To augment our robust distribution network, we operate a total of 396 Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to stores within the surrounding areas to an average of 55,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to approximately 107,000 SKUs.  More than 95% of our stores receive multiple same-day deliveries and deliveries on weekends of hard to find parts from our DCs and Hub stores.  We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business. \n​\nExperienced Management Team:\nOur Company philosophy is to “promote from within,” and the vast majority of our senior managers, district managers, and store managers have been promoted from within the Company.  We augment this “promote from within” philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience, technical proficiency, or subject matter expertise.  We have a strong management Team that has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 32 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993.  See our “Team Members and Human Capital Management” disclosure of the “Business” section of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about our experienced management Team.\n​\nGrowth Strategy\n​\nAggressively Open New Stores:\nWe intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket.  During 2024, we opened 198 net, new stores and acquired 23 stores in Canada.  In 2025, we plan to open 200 to 210 net, new stores, which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets.  The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O’Reilly stores.  We typically open new stores by\n(i)\nconstructing a new facility or renovating an existing facility on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory;\n(ii)\nacquiring an independently owned auto parts store (“jobber store”), typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store; or\n(iii)\npurchasing multi-store chains.\n​\nNew store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising, and distribution.  Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, vehicles in operation, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities, and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius.\n​\nWe target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network.  While we have, and continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets in order to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets.  We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.  Therefore, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.\n​\nGrow Sales in Existing Stores:\nProfitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy.  To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O’Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers.  We believe that while competitive \n7\n\n\n​\npricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service, that generates sustainable increased sales and profitability.\n​\nSelectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions:\nThe automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, like O’Reilly, to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation.  Our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new domestic and international markets.\n​\nContinually Enhance Store Design and Location:\nOur current prototype store design features optimized square footage, high ceilings, convenient interior store layouts, in-store signage, multilingual signage, bright lighting, convenient ingress and egress, ample parking, and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies to enhance overall customer service.  We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance.  During 2024, we relocated 12 stores and performed minor to major updates or renovations to approximately 710 additional stores.  We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best attract and serve our customers.  \n​\nOmnichannel Growth Strategy:\nOur Omnichannel growth strategies reflect the continued evolution of customer preferences in researching and completing purchases.  More than ever before, our customers’ purchase decisions are informed by a range of interactions, whether in-person, over the phone, or through a variety of digital channels, as they seek to find the professional parts knowledge and product availability they need to meet their automotive repair and maintenance needs.  Our Omnichannel growth strategies are focused on offering our customers an enhanced and seamless research and buying experience through any of these channels.  We have long been known for excellent customer service and continue to grow the functionality and user-friendliness of our digital platforms, including www.OReillyAuto.com,  www.OReillyPro.com, and our O’Reilly Pro mobile application, to enhance our customers’ shopping experience.  Many of our customers interact over multiple channels to research and complete a purchase, and the functionality and features of our digital properties complement the outstanding customer service provided in our brick and mortar locations.\n​\nTeam Members and Human Capital Management\n​\nOur tradition for 68 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “Live Green” culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member’s contribution to the success of O’Reilly.  This focus on professionalism and respect has created an industry-leading Team, and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent.  \n​\nWe are committed to providing a work environment that allows Team Members to feel highly valued and to be productive and effective in their jobs by maintaining an inclusive environment and healthy work/life balance, which we believe increases Team Member engagement.  Our ongoing emphasis on engagement and inclusion, including our policies, recruitment and selection procedures, onboarding processes, and training efforts, positively builds upon our successful “promote from within” philosophy and growth strategies.  \n​\nTalent Acquisition, Retention, and Training:\nOur Company knows the value of a tenured Team, which is why our philosophy is to “promote from within” first.  As management opportunities arise, we look first within the Company and promote those who have performed well, have the right expertise, and have shown leadership potential before looking outside the Company; however, we augment this philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience, customer service excellence, subject matter expertise, and strong culture fit.  This comprehensive approach increases Team Member commitment and has resulted in a very experienced leadership Team.  As of December 31, 2024, our strong management Team was comprised of 251 senior managers who average 19 years of service, 310 corporate managers who average 13 years of service, and 637 district managers who average 14 years of service.\n​\nEach of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists, and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store.  Each of our 637 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores, which provides our stores with strong operational support.\n​\n8\n\n\n​\nWe offer a variety of specific training programs that address a broad spectrum of topics from store and distribution center operations to customer service.  We believe our highly trained Team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers.  A significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers; therefore, our Professional Parts People are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products.  In addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from Professional Parts People, particularly when purchasing hard parts.  The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.\n​\nWe screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts and repairs or automotive aptitude.  New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our Company, as well as the requirements for their specific position.  Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers.  Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O’Reilly Certified Parts Professional test.  Passing the O’Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (“ASE”).\n​\nAll of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers.  For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager.  These Team Members then spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers.  Each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.\n​\nAdditionally, we have extensive processes in place to specifically identify emerging talent and conduct formalized training focused on leadership development.  Store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management, and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model.  Store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a week-long manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri.  Store and district managers also receive continuous training through online training programs, field workshops, regional meetings, and our annual leadership conference.\n​\nEngagement and Inclusion:\nAt O’Reilly, we are committed to fostering a culture of engagement and inclusion where every individual’s voice is heard, valued, and respected.  We believe in celebrating and embracing the unique perspectives, experiences, and talents that each person brings.  We are dedicated to creating an environment that is free from discrimination, harassment, and bias, and where everyone has equal opportunities to thrive and succeed.  We are committed to recruiting and building strong teams through our robust processes for talent acquisition, ongoing leadership development, and active identification of emerging talent.  We have worked to expand opportunities for all of our Team Members through programs designed to prepare them to take on more responsibilities at every level of the organization.  We firmly believe that promoting from within is a differentiator in leveraging Team Member experience and maximizing engagement across the entire Company.  In order to ensure our engagement and inclusion efforts are successful, we survey our Team Members, provide enhanced, collaborative learning through training and resources, and build network groups, action plans, and programs aimed at improving our work environments for our Team Members and customers.\n​\nCompensation, Benefits, and Recognition:\nOur compensation philosophy has always been to incentivize Team Members to “run it like you own it,” and we continually evaluate and benchmark our comprehensive compensation programs to ensure they remain competitive, providing an important tool to attract and retain the best and most qualified Team Members in every market.  We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through various incentive compensation programs.  Store team members have the opportunity to earn incentive pay that increases their base hourly wage consistent with their individual performance or the performance of their store.  Store managers, district managers, region directors, and division vice presidents have the ability to earn additional compensation above their salary or base hourly wage based upon the performance of their stores.  In addition, beginning with the district manager level, we augment our competitive programs with share-based compensation.  We believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our Team Members.\n​\nJust as pay, benefits, and growth opportunities are critically important to our Team Members’ success, we believe it is equally important to recognize Team Members for a job well done.  We regularly present many awards that range from recognizing individual service longevity to performance, allowing peer-to-peer recognition, or management nomination of an individual’s excellent performance.  \n​\n9\n\n\n​\nTeam Composition:\nWe recognize that each and every one of our Team Members plays a very important role in our ability to provide outstanding customer service and achieve consistent, successful performance.  As of January 31, 2025, we employed 93,047 Team Members (78,111 full-time Team Members and 14,936 part-time Team Members), of whom 75,940 were employed at our stores, 12,111 were employed at our DCs, and 4,996 were employed at our corporate and regional offices.  Ours is an increasingly technical business creating the need for knowledgeable Professional Parts People, and our ongoing focus on developing a technically proficient Team has resulted in the growth of the mix of our full-time work force, increasing from 65% at January 31, 2020 to 84% at January 31, 2025.  While full-time Professional Parts People play a vital role in our ongoing success, the flexibility of incorporating part-time employment into our work force is also an important component of providing excellent customer service.  Many of our part-time Team Members choose to work at O’Reilly while attending school, or during other transitional periods in their lives, or simply because of their passion for cars and knowledge of auto parts.  Part-time Team Members have the opportunity to become career Professional Parts People because of our “promote from within” philosophy, and many of our leaders today began their careers as part-time Team Members in our stores or distribution centers.   \n​\nA union represents 465 Team Members in 49 stores in the Greater Bay Area in California and has for many years.  There are 27 Team Members that drive over-the-road trucks in one of our domestic DCs that are also represented by a labor union.  Additionally, two unions represent approximately 1,001 Team Members in Mexico and two unions represent approximately 123 Team Members in Canada.  We consider our current relationship with these unions and union Team Members to be excellent.  With the exception of the previously described Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions.  \n​\nAdditional information about our Team Member population and human capital management practices can be found in our most recent Environmental, Social, and Governance report, which is available on our website at www.OReillyAuto.com.  The information available on our website, including our Environmental, Social, and Governance report is not, and will not be deemed to be, a part of this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n​\nStore Network\n​\nNew Store Site Selection:\nIn selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising, and distribution.  Other key factors we consider in the site selection process are\n●\npopulation density;\n●\ndemographics, including age, life style, and per capita income;\n●\nmarket economic strength, retail draw, and growth patterns;\n●\nnumber, age, and percent of makes and models of registered vehicles;\n●\nthe number, type, and sales potential of existing automotive repair facilities;\n●\nthe number of auto parts stores and other competitors within a predetermined radius;\n●\nphysical location, traffic count, size, economics, and presentation of the site;\n●\nfinancial review of adjacent existing locations; and\n●\nthe type and size of store that should be developed.\n​\nWhen entering new, more densely populated markets, we may, when appropriate, seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale.  After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas.  As these store clusters mature, we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas.  This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.\n​\nStore Locations and Size:\nAs a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket.  Our domestic stores, on average, carry approximately 23,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,800 total square feet in size.  At December 31, 2024, we had a total of approximately 49 million square feet in our 6,265 domestic stores.  Our stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which carry over 153,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 396 Hub \n10\n\n\n​\nstores that average 15,900 square feet in size and carry an average of 55,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to approximately 107,000 SKUs.\n​\nWe believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity.  Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking, easy customer access, and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.\n​\n11\n\n\n​\nThe following table sets forth the geographic distribution and opening

tiered distribution model provides industry-leading parts availability and store in-stock positions, while optimizing our inventory investment by controlling the depth of our store stocked inventory.  Our distribution expansion strategy, supported by our ongoing, significant capital investments, complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores, and additional penetration into existing markets, in the regions surrounding each DC.  \n​\nDistribution Centers:\nAs of December 31, 2024, we operated 31 DCs comprised of approximately 13.1 million operating square feet (see the “Properties” table in Item 2 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about DC operating square footage).  Our DCs stock over 153,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to and have access to multiple other DCs’ inventory.  Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to substantially all of our stores in the continental United States.  In addition, stores within an individual DC’s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the DC’s “city counter,” many of which receive this service seven days per week.  Our DCs provide service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic Hub locations, which redistribute products to surrounding stores.  Our national Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores.\n​\nAs part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2025, we plan to\n●\ncontinue to enhance our distribution network through the engineering, design, expansion, or relocation of new or current DCs;\n●\ncontinue to utilize routing software to enhance logistics efficiencies;\n●\ncontinue to enhance labor management software to improve DC productivity and overall operating efficiency;\n●\ncontinue to refine best practices in all DCs and standardize across the network; \n●\nmake proven, return-on-investment based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs, including conveyor systems, picking modules, lift equipment, and computer hardware; \n●\ncontinue to augment our robust distribution network, when and where appropriate, through the use of strategically located Hubs; and\n●\ninvest in our people to continue providing a safe working environment and anchor in our people first and always model.  \n​\nHub Stores:\nWe currently operate a total of 396 strategically located Hub stores.  In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis.  Our Hub store network consists of 396 Hubs that average approximately 15,900 square feet and carry an average of 55,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to approximately 107,000 SKUs.\n​\nProducts and Purchasing\n​\nOur stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans, and trucks.  Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products, such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, Castrol, Denso, Dorman, Fel-Pro, Gates Rubber, Lucas Oil, Mobil1, Monroe, NGK, Pennzoil, Prestone, Standard, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, and Wix, and a wide selection of quality proprietary private label products, which span the entire good, better, and best value spectrum, under our BesTest®, BrakeBest®, Cartek®, Import Direct®, MasterPro®, MicroGard®, Murray®, Omnispark®, O’Reilly Auto Parts®, Precision®, PowerTorque®, SuperStart®, Syntec®, and Ultima® brands.  Our proprietary private label products are produced by respected automotive manufacturers, meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications, and consist of house brands and nationally recognized proprietary brands, which we have acquired or developed over time.  Our “good” proprietary brands provide a great combination of quality and value, a characteristic important to our DIY customers, while our “better” and “best” proprietary brands offer options for our more heavy-duty DIY customers, as well as our professional service provider customers, who often prefer higher quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses.\n​\nWe have no long-term contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts.  We believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell.  It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers.  We have entered into various programs \n13\n\n\n​\nand arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases.  As a whole, we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good.\n​\nWe purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 645 suppliers, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 26% of our total purchases in 2024.  Our largest supplier in 2024 accounted for approximately 8% of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3% to 6% of our total purchases.\n​\nMarketing\n​\nRetail and Online Marketing:\nOur integrated marketing strategy and Omnichannel efforts include national media channels, in-store, digital, and social media activation, as well as personalized experiences through e-mail and text messaging and marketing the O’Reilly brand through automotive event sponsorships and on-site appearances throughout the country.  Our O’Rewards loyalty program encourages repeat customers, as they accumulate points from their O’Reilly purchases that are redeemable for rewards at various purchase levels.  Our marketing efforts also target the Spanish-speaking market through broadcast media, print, and sports marketing, as well as sponsorships of local and regional events.\n​\nProfessional Marketing:\nTo develop our continued relationships with professional service providers and installers, we employ Territory Sales Managers in all major markets to ensure complete sales territory coverage and personalized service for professional customers.  Flyers, quick reference guides, and catalogs are distributed on a regular basis to all professional service providers, including paint and body shops and fleet maintenance customers to encourage brand and program awareness.  In addition, our professional customer program also offers a proprietary ordering mobile application, business ecommerce platform called www.OReillyPro.com, dedicated Professional Service Specialists in stores, multiple daily deliveries, and access to training opportunities, shop management, maintenance supplies, and the Certified Auto Repair program, which offers professional service providers with the business tools they need to profitably grow and market their business. \n​\nINDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT\n​\nThe automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale.  The total size of the U.S. automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately $414 billion, according to the Auto Care Association.  This market is made up of four segments:  labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales, and tire sales.  We estimate that O’Reilly’s U.S. addressable market within this industry is approximately $150 billion to $160 billion, which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales at wholesale and DIY sales at retail.  We do not sell tires or perform for-fee automotive repairs or installations.  \n​\nCompetition\n​\nThe sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas, including customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition, and price.  We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market.  We compete primarily with\n●\nnational retail and wholesale automotive parts chains (such as AutoZone, Inc., Advance Auto Parts, CARQUEST, and NAPA);\n●\nregional retail and wholesale automotive parts chains;\n●\nwholesalers or jobber stores (some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations such as NAPA, CARQUEST, Bumper to Bumper, and Auto Value);\n●\nautomobile dealers; and\n●\nmass merchandisers and online retailers that carry automotive replacement parts, maintenance items, and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc.).\n​\nWe compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency, helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout, the Omnichannel experience, and convenient and accessible store locations.  Our dual market strategy requires significant capital, including the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket.\n​\n14\n\n\n​\nInflation and Seasonality\n​\nWe have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases, and selective forward buying.  To the extent our acquisition costs increased due to price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products.  As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.\n​\nTo some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns.  While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales, profits, and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.\n​\nRegulations\n​\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, as well as the health and safety of our Team Members and customers, including, but not limited to, those related to the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property.\n​\nAs part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our used oil, oil filter, and battery recycling programs.  We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party suppliers.  The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our Team Members, deposited onto/in pallets and containers, and then recycled by third-party suppliers.  In general, our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site recycling properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the supplier.\n​\nCompliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date.  However, we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.\n​\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n​\nBrad Beckham\n, age 46, Chief Executive

  "item7": "Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n​\nIn Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results, including\n●\nan overview of the key drivers and other influences on the automotive aftermarket industry;\n●\nour results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023;\n●\nour liquidity and capital resources;\n●\nour critical accounting estimates; and\n●\nrecent accounting pronouncements that may affect our Company.\n​\nThe review of Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be made in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information, forward-looking statements, and other risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report. \n \n​\nOVERVIEW\n​\nWe are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada.  We are one of the largest U.S. automotive aftermarket specialty retailers, selling our products to both DIY customers and professional service providers – our “dual market strategy.”  Our goal is to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages, such as our dual market strategy, superior customer service provided by well-trained and technically proficient Team Members, and strategic distribution and hub store network that provides same day and over-night inventory access for our stores to offer a broad selection of product offerings.  The successful execution of our growth strategy includes aggressively opening new stores, growing sales in existing stores, continually enhancing merchandising and store layouts, and implementing our Omnichannel initiatives.  As of December 31, 2024, we operated 6,265 stores in 48 U.S. states and Puerto Rico, 87 stores in Mexico, and 26 stores in Canada.\n​\nThe extensive product line offered in our stores consists of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories, a complete line of auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools, and professional service provider service equipment. Our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer.  For many of our product offerings, this quality differentiation reflects “good,” “better,” and “best” alternatives.  Our sales and total gross profit dollars are, generally, highest for the “best” quality category of products.  Consumers’ willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of enhanced sales and profitability in our industry.  We have ongoing initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of ongoing vehicle maintenance, as well as “purchasing up” on the value spectrum.\n​\nOur stores also offer enhanced services and programs to our customers, including used oil, oil filter, and battery recycling; battery, wiper, and bulb replacement; battery diagnostic testing; electrical and module testing; check engine light code extraction; loaner tool program; drum and rotor resurfacing; custom hydraulic hoses; professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and machine shops.\n​\nOur business is influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors that impact both our industry and consumers, including, but not limited to, inflation, including rising consumer staples; fuel and energy costs; unemployment trends; interest rates; and other economic factors.  Future changes, such as continued broad-based inflation and rapid fuel cost increases that exceed wage growth, may negatively impact our consumers’ level of disposable income, and we cannot predict the degree these changes, or other future changes, may have on our business or industry.\n​\nWe believe the key drivers of demand over the long-term for the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of U.S. miles driven, number of U.S. registered vehicles, annual rate of light vehicle sales, and average vehicle age.\n​\nNumber of Miles Driven: \nThe number of total miles driven in the U.S. influences the demand for repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket.  In total, vehicles in the U.S. are driven approximately three trillion miles per year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and a corresponding continued demand for the repair and maintenance products necessary to keep these vehicles in operation.  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the number of total miles driven in the U.S. increased 0.9% and 2.1% in 2022, and 2023, respectively, and year-to-date through November of 2024, miles driven increased 1.0%.  Total miles driven can be impacted by macroeconomic factors, including rapid increases in fuel cost, but we are unable to predict the degree of impact these factors may have on miles driven in the future.\n​\n29\n\n\n​\nSize and Age of the Vehicle Fleet:\nThe total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the vehicle population heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry.  As reported by the Auto Care Association, the total number of registered vehicles increased 14.2% from 2013 to 2023, bringing the number of light vehicles on the road to 284 million by the end of 2023.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of light vehicle sales in the U.S. (“SAAR”) was approximately 16.8 million vehicles, contributing to the continued growth in the total number of registered vehicles on the road.  From 2013 to 2023, vehicle scrappage rates have remained relatively stable, ranging from 4.1% to 5.7% annually.  As a result, over the past decade, the average age of the U.S. vehicle population has increased, growing 10.6%, from 11.3 years in 2013 to 12.5 years in 2023.  While the annual changes to the vehicle population resulting from new vehicle sales and the fluctuation in vehicle scrappage rates in any given year represent a small percentage of the total light vehicle population and have a muted impact on the total number and average age of vehicles on the road over the short term, we believe our business benefits from the current environment of elevated new and used vehicle prices, as consumers are more willing to continue to invest in their current vehicle.\n​\nWe believe the increase in average vehicle age over the long term can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages due to better quality power trains, interiors and exteriors, coupled with consumers’ willingness to invest in maintaining these higher-mileage, better built vehicles.  As the average age of vehicles on the road increases, a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles that are outside of a manufacturer warranty.  These out-of-warranty, older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles, have more frequent mechanical failures, and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles.  We believe consumers will continue to invest in these reliable, higher-quality, higher-mileage vehicles, and these investments, along with an increasing total light vehicle fleet, will support continued demand for automotive aftermarket products.\n​\nInflationary cost pressures impact our business; however, historically we have been successful, in many cases, in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases, principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases, and selective forward buying.  To the extent our acquisition costs increase due to base commodity price increases or other input cost increases affecting the entire industry, we have typically been able to pass along these cost increases through higher selling prices for the affected products.  As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.\n​\nWe remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values of hard work and excellent customer service. \n \n​\n30\n\n\n​\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n​\nThe table below compares the Company’s selected financial data over a ten-year

ended December 31, 2024, 2020, and 2016.  Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pick-up-in-store orders for U.S. stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation.\n(c)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company adopted a new accounting standard that requires excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation payments to be recorded through the income statement.  In compliance with the standard, the Company did not restate prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.  The Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings, due to the adoption of the new accounting standard.  See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for more information.\n(d)\nFollowing the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December of 2017, the Company revalued its deferred income tax liabilities, which resulted in a one-time benefit to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.  See Note 13 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for more information.\n(e)\nInventory turnover is calculated as cost of goods sold for the last 12 months divided by average inventory.  Average inventory is calculated as the average of inventory for the trailing four quarters used in determining the denominator.\n(f)\nAccounts payable to inventory is calculated as accounts payable divided by inventory.\n31\n\n\n​\n(g)\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation, due to the Company’s adoption of a new accounting standard during the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.  See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for more information.\n(h)\nFree cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, excess tax benefit from share-based compensation payments, and (return of)/investment in tax credit equity investments for the period.\n(i)\nIn 2016 and 2018, the Company acquired materially all assets of Bond Auto Parts (“Bond”) and Bennett Auto Supply, Inc. (“Bennett”), respectively.  After the close of business on December 31, 2018, the Company acquired substantially all of the non-real estate assets of Bennett, including 33 stores that were not included in the 2018 store count and were not operated by the Company in 2018, but beginning January 1, 2019, the operations of the acquired Bennett locations were included in the Company’s store count, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company merged 13 of these acquired Bennett stores into existing O’Reilly locations and rebranded the remaining 20 Bennett stores as O’Reilly stores.  Financial results for these acquired companies have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the dates of the acquisitions forward.\n(j)\nIn 2019, the Company

2023.  Comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased 2.9% and 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Comparable store sales are calculated based on changes in sales for U.S. stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores, and sales to Team Members, as well as sales from Leap Day in the year ended December 31, 2024.  Online sales, resulting from ship-to-home orders and pickup in-store orders for U.S. stores open at least one year are included in the comparable store sales calculation.  We opened 198 and 186 net, new stores during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Additionally, we began operating 23 stores in Canada from the Vast Auto acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2024.  We anticipate new store growth will be 200 to 210 net, new store openings in 2025. \n​\nThe increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, was primarily the result of the 2.9% increase in domestic comparable store sales, a $275 million increase in sales from new stores opened in 2023 and 2024 that are not considered comparable stores, sales from the acquired Vast Auto stores, and sales from one additional day due to Leap Day.  Our comparable store sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2024, was driven by an increase in average ticket value for both professional service provider and DIY customers and positive transaction counts from professional service provider customers, partially offset by negative transaction counts from DIY customers.  Average ticket values benefited from inflationary increases in average selling prices, as compared to the same period in 2023.  Average ticket values also continue to be positively impacted by the increasing complexity and cost of replacement parts necessary to maintain the current population of better-engineered and more technically advanced vehicles.  These better-engineered, more technically advanced vehicles require less frequent repairs, as the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time.  The resulting decrease in repair frequency creates pressure on customer transaction counts; however, when repairs are needed, the cost \n32\n\n\n​\nof replacement parts is, on average, greater, which is a benefit to average ticket values.  The decrease in DIY customer transaction counts was driven by decrease in repair frequency and pressured consumer spending on discretionary categories.\n​\nSee Note 2 “Business Combination” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning the recent acquisition of Vast Auto.  See Note 14 “Revenue” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning the Company’s sales.\n​\nGross Profit:\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased 6% to $8.55 billion (or 51.2% of sales) from $8.10 billion (or 51.3% of sales) for the same period in 2023.  The increase in gross profit dollars for the year ended December 31, 2024, was primarily the result of increase in comparable store sales at existing stores, sales from new and acquired stores, and one additional day due to Leap Day.  The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, was due to the inclusion of the lower gross margin sales from the acquired Vast Auto business and a greater percentage of our total sales mix being generated from professional service provider customers, which carry a lower gross margin than DIY sales, partially offset by improved acquisition costs.   \n​\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased 8% to $5.30 billion (or 31.7% of sales) from $4.92 billion (or 31.1% of sales) for the same period in 2023.  The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2024, was the result of additional Team Members and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count, an additional charge to adjust self-insurance reserves for historical auto liability claims, SG&A associated with the Vast Auto operations, and one additional day due to Leap Day.  The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, was principally due to the self-insurance reserve adjustment, depreciation costs for accelerated refreshment of store related capital expenditures, and information technology investments. \n​\nOperating Income:\nAs a result of the impacts discussed above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased 2% to $3.25 billion (or 19.5% of sales) from $3.19 billion (or 20.2% of sales) for the same period in 2023.\n​\nOther Income and Expense:\nTotal other expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased 13% to $206 million (or 1.2% of sales), from $182 million (or 1.1% of sales) for the same period in 2023.  The increase in total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, was the result of increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings, as compared to a decrease in the same period in 2023.  See Note 10 “Financing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning the Company’s borrowings.  See Note 4 “Fair Value Measurements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning the Company’s trading securities.\n​\nIncome Taxes:\nOur provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024, was flat at $658 million compared to the same period in 2023.  Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased to 21.6% from 21.9% for the same period in 2023.  The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, was primarily the result of a greater benefit from renewable energy tax credits and higher excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.  See Note 18 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning the Company’s income taxes.\n​\nNet Income:\nAs a result of the impacts discussed above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased to $2.39 billion (or 14.3% of sales), from $2.35 billion (or 14.8% of sales) for the same period in 2023.\n​\nEarnings Per Share:\nOur diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased 6% to $40.66 on 59 million shares from $38.47 on 61 million shares for the same period in 2023.  \n​\n2023 Compared to 2022\n​\nA discussion of the changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, has been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with \n33\n\n\n​\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 28, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol “ORLY” or at our internet address, www.OReillyAuto.com, by clicking “Investor Relations” located at the bottom of the page.    \n \n​\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n​\nOur long-term business strategy requires capital to maintain and enhance our existing stores, invest to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, expand distribution infrastructure, develop enhanced information technology systems and tools, and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our Board-approved share repurchase program.  Our material cash requirements necessary to maintain the current operations of our long-term business strategy include, but are not limited to, inventory purchases; human capital obligations, including payroll and benefits; contractual obligations, including debt and interest obligations; capital expenditures; payment of income taxes; and other operational priorities.  We expect to fund our short- and long-term cash and capital requirements with our primary sources of liquidity, which include funds generated from the normal course of our business operations, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program, and senior note offerings.  However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows or maintain liquidity at or above recent levels, as we are unable to predict decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns.  Additionally, these factors could also impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.  \n​\nOur material contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2024, included commitments for short and long-term debt arrangements and interest payments related to long-term debt, future minimum payments under non-cancelable lease arrangements, self-insurance reserves, projected obligations related to future payments under the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, purchase obligations for construction contract commitments, uncertain tax positions and associated estimated interest and penalties, payments for certain deferred income taxes, the obligation to purchase renewable energy tax credits, and payments for the purchase of inventory.  \n​\nWe expect to fund these various commitments and obligations primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.  See Note 7 “Leases,” Note 15 “Share-Based Compensation and Benefit Plans,” Note 16 “Commitments,” and Note 18 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our leasing arrangements, share-based compensation payments, construction commitments, and uncertain tax positions, respectively, which are not reflected in the table below.  \n​\nThe following table identifies the estimated payments for each of the next five years, and in the aggregate thereafter, of the Company’s debt instruments and related interest payments and self-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2024 (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\n​\nLong-Term Debt

Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.\n​\nDue to the absence of scheduled maturities, the nature of the account or the commitment’s cancellation terms, the timing of payments for certain deferred income taxes, uncertain tax positions, and commitments related to future payments under the Company’s nonqualified compensation plan cannot be determined and are therefore excluded from the above table, except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2025, which are included in “Current liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\nOff-balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity, for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.  See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information on our variable interest entities.  We issue stand-by letters of credit, for more information see Note 10 “Financing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our stand-by letters of credit. \n​\n34\n\n\n​\nOther than the commitments discussed in Note 16 “Commitments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing that has, or is reasonably likely to have, a material, current, or future effect on our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.  \n​\nThe following table identifies cash provided

investments for the period.  See page \n37\n for the reconciliation of the calculation of free cash flow. \n​\nCash and cash equivalents balances held outside of the U.S. were $17.2 million and $3.3 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was generally utilized to support the liquidity needs of foreign operations in Mexico and Canada.\n​\n2024 Compared to 2023\n​\nOperating Activities:\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to an increase in operating income, decrease in net inventory, compared to an investment in net inventory in 2023, a decrease in accounts receivable balance, and an increase in accrued benefits, partially offset by the timing of payments for the purchase of transferrable federal renewable energy tax credits.  \n​\nInvesting Activities:\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily the result of the acquisition of Vast Auto and an increase in capital expenditures.  The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to an increase in distribution enhancement and expansion projects, as well as an increase in the number of owned new store openings. \n​\nWe opened 198 and 186 net, new stores in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  We plan to open 200 to 210 net, new stores in 2025.  The costs associated with the expected openings of owned store locations in 2025, including the cost of land acquisition, building construction, fixtures, vehicles, net inventory investment, and computer equipment, are estimated to average approximately $3.0 million to $3.3 million per store.  However, such costs may be significantly lower where we lease, rather than purchase, the store site and higher where we build a Hub, as they require a larger inventory investment and are generally larger in size.\n​\nFinancing Activities:\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily attributable to decreased net borrowings in 2024, partially offset by a lower level of repurchases of our common stock in 2024.\n​\n2023 Compared to 2022\nA discussion of the changes in our operating activities, liquidity activities, and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, has been omitted from this Form 10-K but may be found in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 28, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov by searching with our ticker symbol “ORLY” or at our internet address, www.OReillyAuto.com, by clicking “Investor Relations” located at the bottom of the page.\n​\n35\n\n\n​\nDebt Instruments:\nSee Note 10 “Financing” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the Company’s credit agreement, unsecured revolving credit facility, outstanding letters of credit, commercial paper program, and unsecured senior notes. \n​\nDebt Covenants:\nThe indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and limit our ability to merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our property, in each case as set forth in the indentures.  These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.  As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants applicable to our senior notes.\n​\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50:1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50:1.00.  The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio includes a calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent, and non-cash share-based compensation expense to fixed charges.  Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, and rent expense.  The consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent, and non-cash share-based compensation expense.  Adjusted debt includes outstanding debt, outstanding stand-by letters of credit and similar instruments, and five-times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt.  In the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the Credit Agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments, immediate payment of outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement, and litigation from our lenders.\n​\nWe had a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 6.11 times and 6.42 times as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a consolidated leverage ratio of 1.89 times and 1.93 times as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements.\n \n​\n36\n\n\n​\nThe table below outlines the calculations of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio

derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  We do not, nor do we suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information.  We believe that the presentation of our free cash flow, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and consolidated leverage ratio provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors and reflects the required covenants under the Credit Agreement.  We include these items in judging our performance and believe this non-GAAP information is useful to investors as \n37\n\n\n​\nwell.  Material limitations of these non-GAAP measures are that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts.  We compensate for such limitations by presenting, in the tables above, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n​\nShare Repurchase Program:\nSee Note 12 “Share Repurchase Program” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our share repurchase program. \n \n​\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n​\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management.  Management bases its assumptions, estimates, and adjustments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.  Management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required in establishing these estimates.  Management continues to review these critical accounting estimates and assumptions to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP.  However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.\n​\nSelf-Insurance Reserves:\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, property loss, and Team Member health care benefits.  With the exception of certain Team Member health care benefit liabilities, employment related claims and litigation, certain commercial litigation, and certain regulatory matters, we obtain third-party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability, or property loss claim.  \n​\nWhen estimating our self-insurance liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience and trend-lines, projected medical and legal inflation, growth patterns, and exposure forecasts.  The assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations.  Certain of the self-insurance liabilities are determined at an estimate of their net present value, using the U.S. treasury risk-free rate.  Our calculation of self-insurance liabilities requires management to apply a significant amount of subjective judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to resolve reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date.  The application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities.  Management believes the assumptions developed and used to determine the estimate for our self-insurance reserve are reasonable.  Actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates, which may result in material losses or gains.  \n​\nAs we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods, we adjust our self-insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information.  These liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value.  These liabilities do not have scheduled maturities, but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.  We could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities.  \n​\nOur self-insurance reserve estimate included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets increased $54 million from 2023 to 2024, which is primarily due to inflation in claim development costs, as well as our growing operations, increases in healthcare costs, the number of vehicles, and the number of hours worked, partially offset by having resolved and paid out claims throughout 2024.  If the underlying assumptions in management’s estimate changed self-insurance reserves by 10% from our estimated reserves at December 31, 2024, the financial impact would have been approximately $27 million or 0.9% of pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2024.  See Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves.     \n \n​\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n​\nSee Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements
