  "item1": "ITEM 1. \nBUSINESS\nGeneral\nWe are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, including tower structures, rooftops, and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites.” Our principal operations are in the United States and its territories. In addition, we own and operate towers in South America, Central America, Canada, and Africa.\n \nOn January 10, 2025, we sold all our towers and ended our operations in the Philippines and on February 20, 2025, we entered into an agreement to sell all of our towers and related assets held in Colombia. Our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed 98.4% of our total segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2024. In our site leasing business, we (1) lease space to wireless service providers and other customers on assets that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, we owned 39,749 towers, a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business through organic growth and expansion of our tower portfolio to create shareholder value. We believe that the long-term and repetitive nature of our site leasing business will permit us to maintain a stable, recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending which arises in our site development business. We believe that our tower operations are highly scalable. Consequently, we believe that we are able to materially increase our domestic and international tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling, general, and administrative expenses. Key elements of our strategy include:\nOrganic Growth.\n\nMaximizing our Tower Capacity. \nWe generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity tower structures. Most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas, and we believe that increased use of our towers’ structural capacity can generate additional lease revenue and be achieved at a low incremental cost. We measure the available capacity of our existing sites to support additional tenants by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, wind loading, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. We actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force. As of December 31, 2024, we had an average of 1.9 tenants per site.\n\nCapitalizing on our Scale and Management Experience. \nWe are a large owner, operator and developer of towers, with substantial capital, human, and operating resources. We have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the U.S. since 1989 and have owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997. We believe our size, experience, capabilities, and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the U.S. and internationally. Our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development, with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries. We believe that our industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will permit us to continue to organically grow our site leasing and site development services.\nSystematic Tower Portfolio Growth. \nWe intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures. We believe that one of the best uses of our liquidity, including cash from operating activities and borrowings, is to acquire and/or build new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our long-term target leverage ratios.\n\nDisciplined Domestic and International Tower Acquisitions.\n In our tower acquisition program, we pursue towers from third parties that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns. For each acquisition, we prepare various analyses that include projections of several different investment return metrics, review of available capacity, future lease up projections, and a summary of current and future tenant/technology mix. For example, in the third quarter of 2024 we entered into a purchase agreement with Millicom International Cellular S.A. (“Millicom”) for over 7,000 sites throughout Central America. This transaction supports our desire to secure our position as a leader in our international markets and align ourselves with the leading carriers in such markets.\n\nStrategic New Builds.\n We believe strategic new builds can contribute to profitable growth, particularly in our international markets. In our new build program, we construct tower structures (1) under build-to-suit arrangements or (2) in locations that are strategically chosen by us. Under build-to-suit arrangements, we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified. Under these arrangements, we retain ownership of the tower structure and \n\n\n1\nTable of Contents\n\n\nthe exclusive right to co-locate additional tenants. When we construct tower structures in locations chosen by us, we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need, or will need, to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands. We generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower structure on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants. As part of the Millicom transaction, we have agreed to a seven-year exclusivity right for us to build up to 2,500 build-to-suit sites in Central America with each site built having an initial lease term of 15 years.\n\nInternational Market Maximization. \nWe are focused on maximizing our site leasing services and profitability in international markets that meet our investment criteria and where we believe we have, or have the ability to achieve, scale. Our investment criteria focuses on the quality and quantity of wireless service providers in a given country as well as the country’s political and regulatory environments. \nThe majority of our international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and lower wireless data penetration rates than those in the United States. Accordingly, our tower growth in these markets is primarily driven by (1) wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks, (2) increased consumer mobile data traffic, such as media streaming, mobile apps and games, web browsing, and email, and (3) incremental spectrum auctions as well as incremental voice and data network deployments. We continually evaluate how a particular market meets our long-term strategic and financial objectives and our business generally.\nUsing our Local Presence to Build Strong Relationships with Major Wireless Service Providers.\n Given the nature of towers as location-specific communications facilities, we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally. Consequently, we have broad field organizations across the U.S. and in our international markets that allow us to develop and capitalize on our experience, expertise, and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships. Due to our presence in local markets, we believe we are well positioned to proactively grow and defend our site leasing business and to capture new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets.\nControlling our Underlying Land Positions\n. We believe that a primary component of a strong site leasing business is the ability to control the underlying land positions. Consequently, we have acquired perpetual easements, long-term leases, or other property interests for the land that underlies our tower structures and intend to continue to do so to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices. We believe that these perpetual easements, long-term leases, and other property interests will increase our margins, improve our cash flow from operations, and minimize our exposure to increases in rents for property interests in the future. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 72% of our tower structures were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases and other property interests, including renewal options under our control, was 36 years. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 11.6% of our tower structures had ground leases or other property interests maturing in the next 10 years.\nExploring Opportunities in Evolving Technologies and Ancillary Services.\n In addition to our traditional tower-related services, we continue to explore ancillary services and evolving technologies that we believe will allow us to create additional value by leveraging our current assets, capabilities, and relationships with wireless service providers and others by expanding SBA’s business within the growing communications ecosystem. \nThis includes supporting efforts for edge data centers and private networks utilizing cellular and Wi-Fi technologies\n. For example, we are exploring ways to participate in edge computing infrastructure to support existing and future customers’ increasing need to deploy computing capabilities to locations closer to their end users, such as regional data centers and smaller local data centers located at the base of our towers. SBA owns two regional data centers in the U.S. and one regional data center in Brazil, as well as tower-based data centers in support of this initiative. \nWith regard to open-access networks, SBA works with real estate developers in deploying networks that are accessible throughout a community’s various common areas and resident amenities. We have also partnered with carriers and high-traffic consumer retailers in developing systems for the offloading of data to wireless networks. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities to leverage tower assets and infrastructure to provide energy as a service, including through the deployment of on-site battery backup systems and solar energy solutions. \nIndustry Developments \nWe believe that growing wireless data traffic will require wireless service providers to continue to increase the capacity of their networks, and we believe that the continued capacity increases will require our customers to install equipment at new sites and add new equipment at existing sites. We expect that the wireless communications industry will continue to experience growth as a result of the following trends:\n\nConsumers are increasing their demand for wireless connectivity due to the adoption of bandwidth-intensive wireless data applications, such as high-definition streaming, generative artificial intelligence, banking, gaming, social networking, enhanced web browsing, and machine-to-machine applications. According to a report published by Ericsson in November 2024, global total mobile data traffic was estimated to reach around 157 exabytes per month by the end of 2024 and is projected to grow by a factor of 3x to reach 473 exabytes per month in 2030.\n\n\n2\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\nThe velocity of spectrum development is expected to remain dynamic as carriers continue to deploy new bands and optimize bands that are currently in service, both of which activities we expect will require carriers to install equipment at new sites and add new equipment at existing sites. For example, past and future spectrum auctions, such as Auction 108 and Auction 110 in the U.S. are expected to continue to contribute to growth in the upcoming years. In addition, the continued deployment of 5G wireless technologies is expected to increase equipment installation at existing sites and may increase the need for new sites.\n\nConsumers list network quality as a key contributor when terminating or changing service. To remain competitive and to decrease subscriber churn rates, wireless carriers have made substantial capital investments into their wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage. We expect wireless carriers to continue to expend capital to differentiate their product offerings.\nWe believe that the worldwide wireless industry will continue to grow and is reasonably well-capitalized, highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services; therefore, we expect that we will see a multi-year trend of additional demand for tower space from our customers, which we believe will translate into steady leasing growth for us.\nOur Businesses\nSite Leasing Services\nOur primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the United States, South America, Central America, Canada, and Africa. We derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants. Wireless service providers enter into (1) individual tenant site leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site or (2) master lease agreements with us, which provide for the material terms and conditions that will apply to multiple sites; although, in most cases, each individual site under a master lease agreement is also governed by its own site leasing agreement which sets forth pricing and other site specific terms. Our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit, representing 96.2% or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three fiscal years. Our site leasing business is classified into two reportable segments, domestic site leasing and international site leasing.\nDomestic Site Leasing\nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned 17,464 sites in the United States and its territories. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated 73.7% of our total site leasing revenue from these sites. We derive domestic site leasing revenues primarily from T-Mobile, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon Wireless. In the United States, our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to ten years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific annual rent escalators, including renewal option periods. Our ground leases and other property interests in the United States are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods, which are at our option, and provide for specific annual rent escalators. As of December 31, 2024, no U.S. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total tower portfolio by tower count, and no U.S. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nInternational Site Leasing\nWe currently own and operate towers in 13 international markets throughout South America, Central America, Canada, and Africa. As of December 31, 2024, we owned 22,285 sites in our international markets, of which approximately 30% of our total towers are located in Brazil and no other international markets (each country is considered a market) represented more than 5% of our total towers. Our operations in our international markets are primarily in the site leasing business, and we continue to focus on growing our international site leasing business through the acquisition and development of towers and organic growth.\nWe derive international site leasing revenues from all the major carriers in each of the 13 countries in which we operate. Our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to fifteen years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant. Our tenant leases typically either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators, (2) escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index, or (3) escalate using a combination of fixed and inflation adjusted escalators. In addition, our international site leases may include pass-through charges, such as rent related to ground leases and other property interests, utilities, and fuel.\nIn our international markets, ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods, which are at our option. Our ground leases typically either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators or (2) escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index.\n\n\n3\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nIn Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures arising from our activities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Specifically, most of our ground leases and other property interests, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are paid in U.S. dollars. In most of our Central American markets, our local currency obligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and (3) taxes. In Brazil, Canada, Chile, and South Africa, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in local currency. In Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, and Tanzania, our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and U.S. dollars.\nSite Development Services\nOur site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers that generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end-to-end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure; (4) support in leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. We provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through regional, market, and project offices. These market offices are responsible for all site development operations.\nCustomers\nWe depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues. The following customers represented at least 10% of our total revenues during the last three years:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor the year ended December 31, \nPercentage of Total Revenues\n \n \n \n2024\n \n2023\n \n2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nT-Mobile\n \n \n \n30.5%\n \n32.5%\n \n36.4%\nAT&T Wireless\n \n \n \n20.6%\n \n19.5%\n \n19.6%\nVerizon Wireless\n \n \n \n15.1%\n \n14.6%\n \n14.5%\n \nIn addition to the Big 3 wireless carriers (T-Mobile, AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless), we have also provided services or leased space to a number of other customers during 2024 including:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAirtel Tanzania\nFreedom Mobile\nTigo\nC Spire (f/k/a Cellular South)\nLiberty Technologies\nTIM\nClaro\nMTN\nTelefonica\nDigicel\nSouthernLinc\nU.S. Cellular\nEchostar (f/k/a DISH Wireless)\nTelkom\nVodacom\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing goals are to:\n\nuse existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and sell related services with respect to our owned towers or managed properties, enabling us to grow our site leasing business; and\n\nsuccessfully bid and win those site development services contracts that will contribute to our operating margins and/or provide a financial or strategic benefit to our site leasing business.\nWe approach sales on a company-wide basis, involving many of our employees. We have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our management team to sell our services and cultivate customer relationships. Our strategy is to delegate sales efforts by geographic region or to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers. Most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices. We believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters. Our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate. Our sales staff’s compensation is heavily weighted to incentive-based goals and measurements.\n\n\n4\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nCompetition\nDomestic Site Leasing\n – In the U.S., our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are (1) large independent tower companies including American Tower Corporation and Crown Castle International; (2) a number of regional independent tower owners; (3) wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease, or may in the future decide to lease, antenna space to other providers; (4) owners and operators of alternative facilities such as rooftops, outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, billboards, utility poles, and electric transmission towers; and (5) owners and operators of alternative wireless technology systems and architectures.\nInternational Site Leasing \n– Internationally, our competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks, large multinational, national, and regional independent tower companies, and alternative facilities such as rooftop, outdoor and indoor networks, billboards, utility poles, and electric transmission towers. \nWe believe that tower location and capacity, quality of service, density within a geographic market, and price historically have been, and will continue to be, the most significant competitive factors affecting the domestic and international site leasing business.\nSite Development\n – The site development business is competitive and price sensitive. We believe that the majority of our competitors in the U.S. site development business operate within local region and market areas, while some firms offer their services nationally. The market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site development companies, zoning consultants, real estate firms, wireless construction companies, tower owners, telecommunications equipment vendors, which provide end-to-end site development services through multiple subcontractors, and wireless service providers’ internal staff. We believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria, including company experience, price, track record, local reputation, geographic reach, and time for completion of a project.\nHuman Capital\nOur corporate offices are located in Boca Raton, Florida. We also have employees located in our international, regional, and local offices. We consider our employee relations to be good. As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,720 employees of which 628 were based outside of the U.S. and its territories.\nTalent Management.\n We recognize and appreciate the impact our employees have on the success of our company, our customers, and the communities we serve. We pride ourselves on our ownership mindset, agility and team spirit and provide customer service with quality and integrity. We also value all those who serve our country and are proud to support military veterans and their families as they transition out of the military. \nWe recognize the value of attracting, developing, engaging, and retaining our talent. We invest in our employees’ professional growth and development by providing resources and opportunities to develop their skills and expand their expertise.\n \nWe see diversity of thought and experiences as critical factors to the long-term success of SBA. We are committed to building a pipeline of future business leaders by recruiting and retaining talent from the communities and markets we serve.\nEmployee Well-Being. \nThe well-being of our employees is a critical element of our culture, employee engagement, and productivity. Our global compensation and benefits strategy provides programs and resources focused on overall well-being. We offer a competitive total rewards package which includes market-based pay, performance-based annual incentive awards, healthcare and retirement benefits, holiday and paid time off, and tuition assistance.\nHealth and Safety\n. \nAt SBA, providing a safe and healthy work environment for the protection of our employees is paramount. The safety of our tower technicians has been a critical focus of the company since our founding. In 2013, we opened our central training facility \"Tower U\" which provides a rigorous safety certification program that is required for our tower technicians. We are proud that our average lost-day incident rate in the U.S. (days away from work due to workplace incidents) for 2024 was below the 2023 Bureau of Labor benchmark.\nRegulatory and Environmental Matters\nFederal Regulations. \nIn the U.S., which accounted for 73.7% of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, both the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) regulate towers. Many FAA requirements are implemented in FCC regulations. These regulations govern the construction, lighting, and \n\n\n5\nTable of Contents\n\n\npainting or other marking of towers, as well as the maintenance, inspection, and record keeping related to towers, and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers, require prior approval and registration of towers before they may be constructed, altered or used. Wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations antennas operating on towers are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used. In addition, any applicant for an FCC tower structure registration (through the FCC’s Antenna Structure Registration System) must certify that, consistent with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance. New tower construction also requires approval from the state or local governing authority for the proposed site, compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (“NHPA”), compliance with the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), and may require notification to the FAA and registration with the FCC.\nPursuant to the requirements of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the FCC, in conjunction with the FAA, has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified towers. These standards mandate that the FCC and the FAA consider the height of the proposed tower, the relationship of the tower to existing natural or man-made obstructions, and the proximity of the tower to runways and airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the FAA to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. The FAA may condition its issuance of a no-hazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting and/or painting requirements. Towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the FCC. A tower that requires FAA clearance will not be registered with the FCC until it is cleared by the FAA. The FCC’s Antenna Structure Registration (ASR) will include any FAA required lighting and/or painting. Owners of wireless communications towers have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with FAA and FCC regulations. While the FCC requires owners to register and exercise primary responsibility for painting and lighting of antenna structures meeting the registration criteria, licensees, and permittees, collocated on the tower or antenna structure, are also responsible to ensure that the structure maintains all FAA and FCC painting and lighting requirements.\nOwners and operators of towers may be subject to, and therefore must comply with, environmental laws, including NEPA, NHPA, and ESA. Any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to NEPA, among other statutes, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances. The FCC has issued regulations implementing NEPA. These regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying a tower and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower. In the event the FCC determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the FCC has developed, the FCC would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement, which will be subject to public comment. This process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower.\nWe generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with legal and regulatory compliance requirements applicable to tower owners or operators relating to the construction, modification, or placement of towers. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties.\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction, modification, and placement of towers. The law, however, limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of radio communication towers. Finally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the FCC’s rules implementing that Act require the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites on federal property for their facilities. This may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities.\nOperators of towers must also take into consideration certain radio frequency (“RF”) emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements. Certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from tower structures are also reviewed by the FCC to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to RF emissions.\nEnvironmental Regulation\n. As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability for the cleanup of on-site or off-site contamination and related personal injury or property damage. We are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement and may require pre-construction environmental studies. We comply with the FCC National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) which requires screening for environmental impacts including the evaluation of those of our tower site locations (1) that might be located in a wilderness area or a wildlife preserve, (2) that might affect threatened and endangered species or their habitat (ESA), (3) that might affect properties included in, or eligible for inclusion, in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or Indian religious and cultural sites, (4) that might affect World Heritage areas and IUCN Category I-IV protected areas, (5) that will be located in a floodplain and where facility \n\n\n6\nTable of Contents\n\n\nequipment will not be placed at least one foot above the base flood elevation of the floodplain, (6) whose construction will involve significant changes in surface features (e.g., in wetlands, water diversions, considerable ground disturbance, deforestation), (7) that might affect migratory birds if the towers are over 450 feet, (8) that involve high-intensity lighting in a residential area, (9) that would cause RF radiation over FCC-established limits, and (10) that would involve similar considerations under the laws or best practices of our international markets. When a tower site is impacted by any of the listed categories, we promptly complete an environmental assessment and obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory agency, which may include steps to mitigate the impact of construction or operation of the site. Our regional site managers regularly inspect our tower sites and report on any environmental or compliance issues. This ensures we minimize our environmental impact and remain compliant during the operational life of our assets.\nWe believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws. These costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nState and Local Regulations\n. Most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition, leasing activities, and construction activities. Where required, we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents, who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors, and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors, who may be our employees or independent contractors. Local regulations include city and other local ordinances, zoning restrictions, and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations, or certain other entities prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers. FCC rules establish presumptively reasonable time periods for state and local authorities to act on applications to collocate a facility or deploy a facility, such as a tower. In addition, many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations. Local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers, and have, in some instances, instituted moratoria. However, in August 2018, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling stating that express and de facto moratoria on deployment of telecommunications facilities violate the Communications Act. This FCC ruling has been affirmed by a federal appellate court.\nInternational Regulations\n. Regulatory regimes outside of the U.S. and its territories vary by country and locality; however, these regulations typically require tower owners and/or licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Additionally, some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting, lighting, and maintenance. Our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas. Based on our experience to date, these regimes have been similar to, but not more rigorous, burdensome or comprehensive than, those in the U.S. Non-compliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders. Our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters. As we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas, we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions.\nAvailability of Reports and Other Information\nSBA Communications Corporation was incorporated in the State of Florida in March 1997 and is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. \nMANAGEMENT’S\n DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, including tower structures, rooftops, and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications, which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites.” Our principal operations are in the United States and its territories. In addition, we own and operate towers in South America, Central America, Canada, and Africa. On January 10, 2025, we sold all of our towers and ended our operations in the Philippines and on February 20, 2025, we entered into an agreement to sell all of our towers and related assets held in Colombia. Our primary business line is our site leasing business, which contributed 98.4% of our total segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2024. In our site leasing business, we (1) lease space to wireless service providers and other customers on assets that we own or operate and (2) manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, we owned 39,749 towers, a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.\nSite Leasing\nOur primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term lease contracts in the United States, South America, Central America, Canada, and Africa. As of December 31, 2024, no U.S. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total tower portfolio by tower count, and no U.S. state or territory accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, approximately 30% of our total towers are located in Brazil and no other international market (each country is considered a market) represented more than 5% of our total towers.\nWe \nderive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants. Wireless service providers enter into either (1) standalone individual tenant site leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site, or (2) master \n\n\n24\nTable of Contents\n\n\nlease agreements (“MLA”) with us, which provide for the material terms and conditions that will apply to multiple sites; although, in most cases, each individual site under a MLA is also governed by its own site leasing agreement which sets forth pricing and other site specific terms. Our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to fifteen years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant. Our tenant leases typically either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators, (2) escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index, or (3) escalate using a combination of fixed and inflation adjusted escalators. In addition, our international site leases may include pass-through charges, such as rent related to ground leases and other property interests, utilities, property taxes, and fuel.\nCost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of:\n•\nCash and non-cash rental expense on ground leases, right-of-use, and other underlying property interests;\n•\nProperty taxes;\n•\nSite maintenance and monitoring costs (exclusive of employee related costs);\n•\nUtilities;\n•\nProperty insurance;\n•\nFuel (in those international markets that do not have an available electric grid at our tower sites); and\n•\nLease initial direct cost amortization.\nGround leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods, which are at our option. Our ground leases either (1) contain specific annual rent escalators, or (2) escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 72% of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own, land subject to perpetual easements, or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years. For any given tower, costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower. The amount of property taxes varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower. The ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems, painting a tower, or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing.\nIn Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures arising from our activities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Specifically, most of our ground leases and other property interests, tenant leases, and tower-related expenses are paid in U.S. dollars. In most of our Central American markets, our local currency obligations are principally limited to (1) permitting and other local fees, (2) utilities, and (3) taxes. In Brazil, Canada, Chile, and South Africa, significantly all of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in local currency. In Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, and Tanzania, our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures, including tenant leases, ground leases and other property interests, and other tower-related expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and U.S. dollars.\nAs indicated in the table below, our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. For information regarding our operating segments, see Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor the year ended\nSegment operating profit as a percentage of\n \nDecember 31,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntotal operating profit\n \n2024\n \n2023\n \n2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDomestic site leasing\n \n \n75.9%\n \n \n75.2%\n \n \n77.0%\nInternational site leasing\n \n \n22.5%\n \n \n22.2%\n \n \n19.2%\nTotal site leasing\n \n \n98.4%\n \n \n97.4%\n \n \n96.2%\n \nWe believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins, and low customer churn (which refers to a lease that is non-renewed, cancelled, or discounted prior to the end of its term) other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of specific technology. \nWe believe that over the long-term, site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer, network expansion, and network coverage requirements.\nDuring 2025, we expect core leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to increase over 2024 levels, on a currency neutral basis, due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum, the full year impact of towers acquired and built during 2024, and the revenues from towers expected to be acquired and built during 2025. We believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and long-term recurring revenues, predictable operating costs, and minimal non-discretionary capital expenditures. \nDue to the nature and mix of our tower portfolio, we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal.\n Consequently, we expect to grow our cash flows by (1) adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and (2) executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment. Furthermore, because our towers \n\n\n25\nTable of Contents\n\n\nare strategically positioned, we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology.\nSite Development\nOur site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Site development revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end-to-end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services include: (1) network pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure; (4) support in leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning, and maintenance. We provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis, through regional, market, and project offices. The market offices are responsible for all site development operations.\nFor information regarding our operating segments, see Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report.\nCapital Allocation Strategy\nOur capital allocation strategy is aimed at increasing shareholder value through investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria, stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value, and by returning cash generated by our operations in the form of cash dividends. In addition, in a high interest rate environment and when we believe interest rates may stay higher for longer, we believe that debt repayments, especially of our variable rate debt, may be an accretive use of our excess capital. While the addition of cash dividends and debt repayments have provided us with additional tools to return value to our shareholders, we continue to believe that our priority is to make investments focused on increasing Adjusted Funds From Operations per share. Key elements of our capital allocation strategy include:\nPortfolio Growth. \nWe intend to continue to grow our asset portfolio, domestically and internationally, primarily through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers that meet our internal return on invested capital criteria.\nStock Repurchase Program. \nWe currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below its intrinsic value. We believe that share repurchases, when purchased at the right price, will facilitate our goal of increasing our Adjusted Funds From Operations per share.\nDividend.\n Cash dividends are an additional component of our strategy of returning value to shareholders. We do not expect our dividend to require any changes in our leverage and believe that, due to our low dividend payout ratio, we can continue to focus on building and buying quality assets and opportunistically buying back our stock. While the timing and amount of future dividends will be subject to approval by our Board of Directors, we believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to grow our cash dividend in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with no need for management’s judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant.\n\n\n26\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we completed our assessment on the remaining estimated useful lives of our towers and intangible assets. We concluded through our assessment that, for U.S. GAAP purposes, we should modify our current estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating experience and the findings obtained by our independent consultant. We previously depreciated our towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the (i) term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or (ii) estimated useful life of a tower, which we had historically estimated to be 15 years. Based on our assessment, we revised the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets (which are amortized on a similar basis to our tower assets, as their useful lives correlate to the useful life of the towers) from 15 years to 30 years, effective January 1, 2024. We accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate under ASC 250 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” The impact of the change in estimate was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2024, resulting in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $411.5 million ($372.5 million after tax, or an increase of $3.45 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2024. There have been no other material changes to our significant accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nRevenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable\nSite leasing revenues\nRevenue from site leasing is recognized on a straight-line basis over the current term of the related lease agreements, which are generally five years to fifteen years. Receivables recorded related to the straight-lining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenue from site leasing represents 94% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nSite development revenues\nSite development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a fixed price basis that are billed at contractual rates. Revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved, which are determined based on costs incurred. Amounts billed in advance (collected or uncollected) are recorded as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRevenue from construction projects is recognized over time, determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract. This method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts. These amounts are based on estimates, and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion. Refer to Note 5 in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for further detail of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable.\nThe site development segment represents approximately 6% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. We account for site development revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Payment terms do not result in any significant financing arrangements. Furthermore, these contracts do not typically include variable consideration; therefore, the transaction price that is recognized over time is generally the amount of the total contract.\nAccounts receivable\nThe accounts receivable balance for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $145.7 million and $182.7 million, respectively, of which $26.4 million and $32.3 million related to the site development segment, respectively. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers. In addition, we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience, specific customer collection issues identified, and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms. Interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable. Refer to Note 15 in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for further detail of the site development segment.\nLease Accounting\nASC 842, Leases, requires all lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. We have elected not to separate nonlease components from the associated lease component for all underlying classes of assets. In order to calculate our lease liability, we make certain assumptions related to lease term and discount rate. To determine the lease term, we consider all renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised, taking into consideration all economic factors, including the communications site’s estimated economic life and the respective lease terms of our tenants under \n\n\n27\nTable of Contents\n\n\nthe existing lease arrangements on such site. For the discount rate, we use the rate implicit in the lease when available to discount lease payments to present value. However, our ground leases and other property interests generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, we estimate the incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments based on the lease term and lease currency. We use publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates. Refer to Note 2 in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for further discussion on lease accounting.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis report presents our financial results and other financial metrics on a GAAP basis and, with respect to our international and consolidated results, after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on our intercompany loans.\n \nYear Ended 2024 Compared to Year Ended 2023\nRevenues and Segment Operating Profit:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor the year ended\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConstant\n \n \nDecember 31,\n \nForeign\n \nConstant\n \nCurrency\n \n \n2024\n \n2023\n \nCurrency Impact\n \nCurrency Change\n \n% Change\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRevenues\n \n(in thousands)\n \n \n \nDomestic site leasing\n \n$\n 1,861,424\n \n$\n 1,846,554\n \n$\n —\n \n$\n 14,870\n \n \n 0.8%\nInternational site leasing\n \n \n 665,341\n \n \n 670,381\n \n \n (37,553)\n \n \n 32,513\n \n \n 4.8%\nSite development\n \n \n 152,869\n \n \n 194,649\n \n \n —\n \n \n (41,780)\n \n \n (21.5%)\nTotal\n \n$\n 2,679,634\n \n$\n 2,711,584\n \n$\n (37,553)\n \n$\n 5,603\n \n \n 0.2%\nCost of Revenues\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDomestic site leasing\n \n$\n 269,168\n \n$\n 268,572\n \n$\n —\n \n$\n 596\n \n \n 0.2%\nInternational site leasing\n \n \n 193,829\n \n \n 204,115\n \n \n (11,016)\n \n \n 730\n \n \n 0.4%\nSite development\n \n \n 118,730\n \n \n 139,935\n \n \n —\n \n \n (21,205)\n \n \n (15.2%)\nTotal\n \n$\n 581,727\n \n$\n 612,622\n \n$\n (11,016)\n \n$\n (19,879)\n \n \n (3.2%)\nOperating Profit\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDomestic site leasing\n \n$\n 1,592,256\n \n$\n 1,577,982\n \n$\n —\n \n$\n 14,274\n \n \n 0.9%\nInternational site leasing\n \n \n 471,512\n \n \n 466,266\n \n \n (26,537)\n \n \n 31,783\n \n \n 6.8%\nSite development\n \n \n 34,139\n \n \n 54,714\n \n \n —\n \n \n (20,575)\n \n \n (37.6%)\nRevenues\nDomestic site leasing revenues increased $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to (1) organic site leasing growth\n, primarily from monetary lease amendments (due in part to our 2023 MLA with AT&T) and additional equipment added to our towers as well as new leases and contractual rent escalators\n and (2) revenues from 130 towers acquired and 39 towers built since January 1, 2023\n, partially offset by lease non-renewals.\nInternational site leasing revenues decreased $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, international site leasing revenues increased $32.5 million. These changes were primarily due to (1) lease early termination fees, (2) organic site leasing growth from new leases, amendments, and contractual escalators, and (3) revenues from 147 towers acquired and 783 towers built since January 1, 2023, partially offset by lease non-renewals and a decrease in reimbursable pass-through expenses.

The prior year included increased impairment charges resulting from the planned abandonment of identified sites with minimal expectations of future economic benefit (primarily from Sprint churn).\nInternational site leasing asset impairment and decommission costs increased $28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year.

These changes were primarily as a result of an increase in impairment charges resulting from our regular analysis of whether the future cash flows from certain towers are adequate to recover the carrying value of the investment in those towers and an increase in tower decommission costs.\nDepreciation, Accretion, and Amortization Expenses:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor the year ended\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConstant\n \n \nDecember 31,\n \nForeign\n \nConstant\n \nCurrency\n \n \n2024\n \n2023\n \nCurrency Impact\n \nCurrency Change\n \n% Change\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(in thousands)\n \n \n \nDomestic site leasing\n \n$\n 145,041\n \n$\n 457,169\n \n$\n —\n \n$\n (312,128)\n \n \n (68.3%)\nInternational site leasing\n \n \n 113,549\n \n \n 248,758\n \n \n (5,893)\n \n \n (129,316)\n \n \n (52.0%)\nTotal site leasing\n \n$\n 258,590\n \n$\n 705,927\n \n$\n (5,893)\n \n$\n (441,444)\n \n \n (62.5%)\nSite development\n \n \n 3,560\n \n \n 3,704\n \n \n —\n \n \n (144)\n \n \n (3.9%)\nOther\n \n \n 7,367\n \n \n 6,678\n \n \n —\n \n \n 689\n \n \n 10.3%\nTotal\n \n$\n 269,517\n \n$\n 716,309\n \n$\n (5,893)\n \n$\n (440,899)\n \n \n (61.6%)\nDepreciation, accretion, and amortization expense decreased $446.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year.

On a constant currency basis, interest income increased $24.2 million. These changes were primarily due to a higher amount of interest-bearing deposits held and a higher effective interest rate on those deposits as compared to the prior year, as well as interest received on a loan to an unconsolidated joint venture.\nInterest expense decreased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, interest expense decreased $0.3 million. These changes were primarily due to a lower average principal amount of variable rate cash-interest bearing debt, partially offset by a higher interest rate on said variable debt as compared to the prior year, as well as a higher average principal amount of fixed rate cash-interest bearing debt accruing interest at a higher weighted-average interest rate.\nNon-cash interest expense decreased $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year.

We have provided below a description of Adjusted EBITDA, a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure. This report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis, which are non-GAAP measures, gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans.\nAdjusted EBITDA \nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding the impact of non-cash straight-line leasing revenue, non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, non-cash compensation, net loss from extinguishment of debt, other income and expenses, acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses, asset impairment and decommission costs, interest income, interest expenses, depreciation, accretion, and amortization, and income taxes.\n\n\n32\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization, and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement and the indentures relating to the 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor the year ended\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConstant\n \n \nDecember 31,\n \nForeign\n \nConstant\n \nCurrency\n \n \n2024\n \n2023\n \nCurrency Impact\n \nCurrency Change\n \n% Change\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(in thousands)\n \n \n \nNet income\n \n$\n 748,677\n \n$\n 497,415\n \n$\n (221,828)\n \n$\n 473,090\n \n \n 105.5%\nNon-cash straight-line leasing revenue\n \n \n (10,851)\n \n \n (25,206)\n \n \n (160)\n \n \n 14,515\n \n \n (57.6%)\nNon-cash straight-line ground lease expense\n \n \n (7,668)\n \n \n (686)\n \n \n (201)\n \n \n (6,781)\n \n \n 988.5%\nNon-cash compensation\n \n \n 74,374\n \n \n 87,919\n \n \n (521)\n \n \n (13,024)\n \n \n (14.8%)\nLoss from extinguishment of debt, net\n \n \n 5,940\n \n \n —\n \n \n —\n \n \n 5,940\n \n \n —%\nOther expense (income), net\n \n \n 250,415\n \n \n (63,053)\n \n \n 320,596\n \n \n (7,128)\n \n \n 52.2%\nAcquisition and new business initiatives\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelated adjustments and expenses\n \n \n 25,946\n \n \n 21,671\n \n \n (467)\n \n \n 4,742\n \n \n 21.9%\nAsset impairment and decommission costs\n \n \n 107,925\n \n \n 169,387\n \n \n (3,762)\n \n \n (57,700)\n \n \n (34.1%)\nInterest income\n \n \n (41,962)\n \n \n (18,305)\n \n \n 515\n \n \n (24,172)\n \n \n 132.1%\nInterest expense \n(1)\n \n \n 448,704\n \n \n 456,514\n \n \n (281)\n \n \n (7,529)\n \n \n (1.6%)\nDepreciation, accretion, and amortization\n \n \n 269,517\n \n \n 716,309\n \n \n (5,893)\n \n \n (440,899)\n \n \n (61.6%)\nProvision for income taxes \n(2)\n \n \n 23,328\n \n \n 51,885\n \n \n (112,444)\n \n \n 83,887\n \n \n 345.5%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n \n$\n 1,894,345\n \n$\n 1,893,850\n \n$\n (24,446)\n \n$\n 24,941\n \n \n 1.3%\n \n(1)\nTotal interest expense includes interest expense, non-cash interest expense, and amortization of deferred financing fees.\n(2)\nProvision for income taxes includes a $0.7 million benefit from franchise and gross receipts taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $0.8 million of franchise taxes for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased $24.9 million. These changes were primarily \ndue to an increase in site leasing segment operating profit, partially offset by a decrease in site development segment operating profit and an increase in cash selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSBAC is a holding company with no business operations of its own. SBAC’s only significant asset is 100% of the outstanding capital stock of SBA Telecommunications, LLC (“Telecommunications”), which is also a holding company that owns equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly own all of our domestic and international towers and assets. We conduct all of our business operations through Telecommunications’ subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations, other than financings, is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries.\n‎\n \n\n\n33\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nA summary of our cash flows is as follows:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor the year ended December 31,\n \n \n2024\n \n2023\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(in thousands)\nCash provided by operating activities\n \n$\n 1,334,866\n \n$\n 1,544,393\nCash used in investing activities\n \n \n (809,310)\n \n \n (468,246)\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities\n \n \n 645,742\n \n \n (1,017,218)\nChange in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n \n \n 1,171,298\n \n \n 58,929\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equiv., and restricted cash\n \n \n (21,587)\n \n \n 2,734\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of year\n \n \n 250,946\n \n \n 189,283\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of year\n \n$\n 1,400,657\n \n$\n 250,946\n \n \nOperating Activities \nCash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.

(“Millicom”) for approximately $975.0 million in cash. These sites are located in Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, with significantly all cash flows denominated in USD. Upon closing, Millicom will enter into country-specific MLAs to lease back space on all acquired sites for an initial term of 15 years. The MLAs will also incorporate an extension to our approximately 1,500 existing site leases with Millicom for a new 15-year term. Additionally, as part of the purchase agreement, we have agreed to a seven-year exclusivity right with Millicom for us to build up to 2,500 build-to-suit sites in Central America for Millicom with new leases on any sites built having an initial lease term of 15 years. This transaction has an estimated closing date of September 1, 2025; however, the ultimate closing is dependent upon regulatory approvals and other requirements and may differ from this date.\n\n\n34\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nIn addition to the Millicom transaction, subsequent to December 31, 2024, we purchased or are under contract to purchase 32 communication sites for an aggregate consideration of $14.6 million in cash. We anticipate that these acquisitions will be closed by the end of the second quarter of 2025.\nFor 2025, we expect to incur non-discretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures of $53.0 million to $63.0 million and discretionary cash capital expenditures, based on current or potential acquisition obligations, planned new tower construction, forecasted tower augmentations, and forecasted ground lease purchases, of $1,255.0 million to $1,275.0 million. We expect to fund these cash capital expenditures from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or new financings. The exact amount of our future cash capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including amounts necessary to support our \ntower\n portfolio, our new tower build and acquisition programs, and our ground lease purchase program.\nFinancing Activities\nA detail of our financing activities is as follows:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor the year ended December 31,\n \n \n2024\n \n2023\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(in thousands)\nNet repayments under Revolving Credit Facility\n (1)\n \n$\n (180,000)\n \n$\n (540,000)\nProceeds from issuance of Term Loans, net of fees \n(1)\n \n \n 2,280,565\n \n \n —\nRepayment of Term Loans \n(1)\n \n \n (2,292,244)\n \n \n (24,000)\nProceeds from issuance of Tower Securities, net of fees \n(1)\n \n \n 2,052,136\n \n \n —\nRepayment of Tower Securities \n(1)\n \n \n (620,269)\n \n \n —\nRepurchase and retirement of common stock \n(2)\n \n \n (200,019)\n \n \n (100,010)\nPayment of dividends on common stock\n \n \n (424,191)\n \n \n (369,960)\nProceeds from employee stock purchase/stock option plans, net of taxes\n \n \n 17,185\n \n \n 16,715\nOther financing activities\n \n \n 12,579\n \n \n 37\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n \n$\n 645,742\n \n$\n (1,017,218)\n \n(1)\nFor additional information regarding our debt instruments and financings, refer to “Debt Instruments and Debt Service Requirements” below. \n(2)\nAs of the date of this filing, we had $204.7 million remaining under the current authorized share repurchase plan.\n \nFor a discussion of our Liquidity and Capital Resources for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.\nDividends\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid the following cash dividends:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPayable to Shareholders\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof Record at the Close\n \nCash Paid\n \nAggregate Amount\n \n \nDate Declared\n \nof Business on\n \nPer Share\n \nPaid\n \nDate Paid\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 26, 2024\n \nMarch 14, 2024\n \n$0.98\n \n$108.1 million \n(1)\n \nMarch 28, 2024\nApril 29, 2024\n \nMay 23, 2024\n \n$0.98\n \n$105.3 million\n \nJune 18, 2024\nJuly 28, 2024\n \nAugust 22, 2024\n \n$0.98\n \n$105.3 million\n \nSeptember 18, 2024\nOctober 27, 2024\n \nNovember 14, 2024\n \n$0.98\n \n$105.4 million\n \nDecember 12, 2024\n(1)\nAmount reflected includes the payment of $1.9 million in dividend equivalents.\nDividends paid in 2024 and 2023 were ordinary taxable dividends.\n‎\n \n\n\n35\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nSubsequent to December 31, 2024, we declared the following cash dividends:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPayable to Shareholders\n \nCash to\n \n \n \n \nof Record at the Close\n \nbe Paid\n \n \nDate Declared\n \nof Business on\n \nPer Share\n \nDate to be Paid\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 23, 2025\n \nMarch 13, 2025\n \n$1.11\n \nMarch 27, 2025\nThe amount of future distributions will be determined, from time to time, by our Board of Directors to balance our goal of increasing long-term shareholder value and retaining sufficient cash to implement our current capital allocation policy, which prioritizes investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria, and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we did not issue any shares of Class A common stock under this registration statement. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 1.2 million shares of Class A common stock remaining under this registration statement.\nOn February 29, 2024, we filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement for well-known seasoned issuers on Form S-3ASR which enables us to issue shares of our Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, or depositary shares as well as units that include any of these securities. We will file a prospectus supplement containing the amount and type of securities each time we issue securities under our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we did not issue any securities under our automatic shelf registration statement.\nDebt Instruments and Debt Service Requirements\nThe Senior Credit Agreement\nOn January 25, 2024, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary SBA Senior Finance II, amended and restated our Senior Credit Agreement to (1) issue a new $2.3 billion Term Loan and retire the 2018 Term Loan, (2) increase the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion, (3) extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to January 25, 2029, and (4) amend certain other terms and conditions under the Senior Credit Agreement.\nOn February 23, 2024, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II LLC, further increased the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1.75 billion to $2.0 billion.\nOn October 2, 2024, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, amended our Senior Credit Agreement to (1) reduce the stated rate of interest of the Initial Term Loans from, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, the Base Rate plus 100 basis points or Term SOFR plus 200 basis points to, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, the Base Rate plus 75 basis points or Term SOFR plus 175 basis points, and (2) amend certain other terms and conditions under the Senior Credit Agreement.\nTerms of the Senior Credit Agreement\nThe Senior Credit Agreement requires SBA Senior Finance II to maintain specific financial ratios, including (1) a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA not to exceed 6.5 times for any fiscal quarter, (2) a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) to Annualized Borrower EBITDA for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 6.5 times for 30 consecutive days, and (3) a ratio of Annualized Borrower EBITDA to Annualized Cash Interest Expense (calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.0 times for any fiscal quarter. The Senior Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of SBA Senior Finance II and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, grant certain liens, make certain investments, enter into sale leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate, make certain restricted payments, enter into transactions with affiliates, and engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of their property. The Senior Credit Agreement is also subject to customary events of default. Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loans and certain hedging transactions that may be entered into by SBA Senior Finance II or the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) with lenders or their affiliates are secured by a first lien on the \n\n\n36\nTable of Contents\n\n\nmembership interests of SBA Telecommunications, LLC, SBA Senior Finance, LLC and SBA Senior Finance II and on substantially all of the assets (other than leasehold, easement and fee interests in real property) of SBA Senior Finance II and the Subsidiary Guarantors.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement permits SBA Senior Finance II, without the consent of the other lenders, to request that one or more lenders provide SBA Senior Finance II with increases in the Revolving Credit Facility or additional term loans provided that after giving effect to the proposed increase in Revolving Credit Facility commitments or incremental term loans the ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA would not exceed 6.5 times. SBA Senior Finance II’s ability to request such increases in the Revolving Credit Facility or additional term loans is subject to its compliance with customary conditions set forth in the Senior Credit Agreement including compliance, on a pro forma basis, with the financial covenants and ratios set forth therein and, with respect to any additional term loan, an increase in the margin on existing term loans to the extent required by the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement. Upon SBA Senior Finance II’s request, each lender may decide, in its sole discretion, whether to increase all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Facility commitment or whether to provide SBA Senior Finance II with additional term loans and, if so, upon what terms. As of December 31, 2024, SBA Senior Finance II was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Senior Credit Agreement.\nRevolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Agreement\nThe Revolving Credit Facility consists of a revolving loan under which up to $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount may be borrowed, repaid and redrawn, based upon specific financial ratios and subject to the satisfaction of other customary conditions to borrowing through the maturity date of January 25, 2029. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either (1) the Eurodollar Rate or Term SOFR Rate plus a margin that ranges from 112.5 basis points to 150.0 basis points or (2) the Base Rate plus a margin that ranges from 12.5 basis points to 50.0 basis points, in each case based on the ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Annualized Borrower EBITDA, calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement. \nIn addition, SBA Senior Finance II is required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.15% and 0.25% per annum on the amount of unused commitment. \nFurthermore, the Revolving Credit Facility incorporates sustainability-linked targets which will adjust the Revolving Credit Facility’s applicable interest and commitment fee rates upward or downward based on how we perform against those targets.\n Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.\n \nSBA Senior Finance II may, from time to time, borrow from and repay the Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, the amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at the end of the period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during such period.\nThe key terms of the \nRevolving Credit Facility\n are as follows:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnused\n \n \nInterest Rate\n \nCommitment\n \n \nas of\n \nFee as of\n \n \nDecember 31, 2024\n (1)\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n (2)\n \n \n \n \n \nRevolving Credit Facility\n \n5.407%\n \n0.140%\n(1)\nThe rate reflected includes a 0.050% reduction in the applicable spread as a result of meeting certain sustainability-linked targets as of December 31, 2023. \n(2)\nThe rate reflected includes a 0.010% reduction in the applicable commitment fee as a result of meeting certain sustainability-linked targets as of December 31, 2023. \nThe table below summarizes our Revolving Credit Facility activity during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor the year\n \nended December 31,\n \n2024\n \n2023\n \n \n \n \nBeginning outstanding balance\n$\n 180,000\n \n$\n 720,000\nBorrowings\n \n 370,000\n \n \n 190,000\nRepayments\n \n (550,000)\n \n \n (730,000)\nEnding outstanding balance\n$\n —\n \n$\n 180,000\nSubsequent to December 31, 2024, we made no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\n\n37\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nTerm Loan under the Senior Credit Agreement\n2024 Term Loan\nOn January 25, 2024, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, issued a term loan (the “2024 Term Loan”) under the amended and restated Senior Credit Agreement. The 2024 Term Loan consists of a senior secured term loan with an initial aggregate principal amount of $2.3 billion that matures on January 25, 2031. The 2024 Term Loan (as amended on October 2, 2024) accrues interest, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either the Base Rate (with a zero Base Rate floor) plus 75 basis points or at Term SOFR (with a floor of 0%) plus 175 basis points. The 2024 Term Loan was issued at 99.75% of par value. The proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan were used to retire our 2018 Term Loan and to pay related fees and expenses. The 2024 Term Loan has a blended rate of 2.428%, which includes the impact of the current interest rate swap. Excluding the impact of the interest rate swap, the 2024 Term Loan was accruing interest at 6.110% as of December 31, 2024.\nPrincipal payments on the 2024 Term Loan are made in quarterly installments o\nn the last day of each March, June, September, and December in an\n amount equal to $5.75 million. We incurred financing fees of approximately $19.4 million in relation to this transaction, which are being amortized through the maturity date. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repaid an aggregate of $17.3 million of principal on the 2024 Term Loan. As of December 31, 2024, the 2024 Term Loan had a principal balance of $2.3 billion.\n2018 Term Loan\nThe 2018 Term Loan consisted of a senior secured term loan with an initial aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion that was set to mature on April 11, 2025. The 2018 Term Loan accrued interest, at SBA Senior Finance II’s election, at either the Base Rate plus 75 basis points (with a zero Base Rate floor) or the Eurodollar Rate plus 175 basis points (with a zero Eurodollar Rate floor). \nOn January 25, 2024, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, retired the 2018 Term Loan. In connection with the repayment, we expensed $3.3 million of net deferred financing fees and $1.2 million of original issuance discount related to the debt. \nInterest Rate Swaps\nOn August 4, 2020, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, entered into an interest rate swap which swapped $1.95 billion of notional value accruing interest at one month LIBOR plus 175 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 1.874% per annum through July 31, 2023.\nOn June 21, 2023, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, amended our existing interest rate swap agreement which swapped $1.95 billion of notional value accruing interest at one month Term SOFR plus 185 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 1.900% per annum from August 1, 2023 through January 25, 2024 (the repayment date of the 2018 Term Loan and issuance date of the 2024 Term Loan). The swap remains in effect under the 2024 Term Loan \n(as amended on October 2, 2024) \nand swaps $1.95 billion of notional value accruing interest at one month Term SOFR plus 175 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 1.800% per annum through March 31, 2025. \nOn November 3, 2023, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement which will swap $1.0 billion of notional value accruing interest at one month Term SOFR plus 175 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 5.580% per annum. On September 6, 2024, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SBA Senior Finance II, entered into an additional forward-starting interest rate swap agreement to swap $1.0 billion of notional value accruing interest at one month Term SOFR plus 175 basis points for an all-in fixed rate of 4.750% per annum (collectively the “forward-starting swaps”). The forward-starting swaps have an effective start date of March 31, 2025 (coinciding with the expiration date of the current $1.95 billion notional value swap) and a maturity date of April 11, 2028. The combined notional value of both forward-starting swaps of $2.0 billion will effectively fix one month term SOFR for a blended all-in fixed rate of 5.165% per annum through April 11, 2028.\n\n\n38\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nSecured Tower Revenue Securities\nTower Revenue Securities Terms\nAs of December 31, 2024, we, through a New York common law trust (the “Trust”), had issued and outstanding an aggregate of $8.4 billion of Secured Tower Revenue Securities (“Tower Securities”). The sole asset of the Trust consists of a non-recourse mortgage loan made in favor of certain of our subsidiaries that are borrowers on the mortgage loan (the “Borrowers”) under which there is a loan tranche for each Tower Security outstanding with the same interest rate and maturity date as the corresponding Tower Security. The mortgage loan will be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate 9,516 tower sites owned by the Borrowers as of December 31, 2024. The mortgage loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust, and deeds to secure debt on a substantial portion of the tower sites, (2) a security interest in the tower sites and substantially all of the Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures, (3) the Borrowers’ rights under certain tenant leases, and (4) all of the proceeds of the foregoing. For each calendar month, SBA Network Management, Inc., an indirect subsidiary (“Network Management”), is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 4.5% of the Borrowers’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month.\nThe Borrowers may prepay any of the mortgage loan components, in whole or in part, with no prepayment consideration, (1) within six months (in the case of the component corresponding to the 2024-2C Tower Securities), twelve months (in the case of the component corresponding to the \n2019-1C Tower Securities, 2020-1C Tower Securities, 2021-1C Tower Securities, 2021-2C Tower Securities, and 2022-1C Tower Securities\n), eighteen months (in the case of the components corresponding to the 2020-2C Tower Securities and 2021-3C Tower Securities), or twenty-four months (in the case of the component corresponding to the 2024-1C Tower Securities) of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component, (2) with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of any tower owned by the Borrowers or (3) during an amortization period. In all other circumstances, the Borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan, in whole or in part, upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration. The prepayment consideration is determined based on the class of the Tower Securities to which the prepaid mortgage loan component corresponds and consists of an amount equal to the net present value associated with the portion of the principal balance being prepaid and calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan agreement.\nTo the extent that the mortgage loan components corresponding to the Tower Securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the interest rate of each such component will increase by the greater of (1) 5% and (2) the amount, if any, by which the sum of (x) the 10 year U.S. treasury rate plus (y) the credit-based spread for such component (as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement) plus (z) 5%, exceeds the original interest rate for such component.\nPursuant to the terms of the Tower Securities, all rents and other sums due on any of the towers owned by the Borrowers are directly deposited by the lessees into a controlled deposit account and are held by the indenture trustee. The monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as short-term restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 4). However, if the Debt Service Coverage Ratio, defined as the net cash flow (as defined in the mortgage loan agreement) divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers are required to pay over the succeeding twelve months, as of the end of any calendar quarter, falls to 1.30x or lower, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as “excess cash flow,” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters. If the Debt Service Coverage Ratio falls below 1.15x as of the end of any calendar quarter, then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the Debt Service Coverage Ratio exceeds 1.15x for a calendar quarter. In addition, if any of the Tower Securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates, the cash flow from the towers owned by the Borrowers will be trapped by the trustee for the Tower Securities and applied first to repay the interest, at the original interest rates, on the mortgage loan components underlying the Tower Securities, second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with those towers, third to pay the management fees due to Network Management, fourth to repay principal of the Tower Securities and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed above. Furthermore, the advance rents reserve requirement states that the Borrowers are required to maintain an advance rents reserve at any time the monthly tenant Debt Service Coverage Ratio is equal to or less than 2:1 and for two calendar months after such coverage ratio again exceeds 2:1. The mortgage loan agreement, as amended, also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets.\n \n‎\n \n\n\n39\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nThe table below sets forth the material terms of our outstanding Tower Securities as of December 31, 2024: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSecurity\n \nIssue Date\n \n \nAmount Outstanding\n‎\n(in millions)\n \n \nInterest \n‎\n Rate \n(1)\n \n \nAnticipated Repayment Date\n \n \nFinal Maturity Date\n2019-1C Tower Securities \n(2)\n \nSep. 13, 2019\n \n \n$1,165.0\n \n \n2.836%\n \n \nJan. 12, 2025\n \n \nJan. 12, 2050\n2020-1C Tower Securities\n \nJul. 14, 2020\n \n \n$750.0\n \n \n1.884%\n \n \nJan. 9, 2026\n \n \nJul. 11, 2050\n2020-2C Tower Securities\n \nJul. 14, 2020\n \n \n$600.0\n \n \n2.328%\n \n \nJan. 11, 2028\n \n \nJul. 9, 2052\n2021-1C Tower Securities\n \nMay 14, 2021\n \n \n$1,165.0\n \n \n1.631%\n \n \nNov. 9, 2026\n \n \nMay 9, 2051\n2021-2C Tower Securities\n \nOct. 27, 2021\n \n \n$895.0\n \n \n1.840%\n \n \nApr. 9, 2027\n \n \nOct. 10, 2051\n2021-3C Tower Securities\n \nOct. 27, 2021\n \n \n$895.0\n \n \n2.593%\n \n \nOct. 9, 2031\n \n \nOct. 10, 2056\n2022-1C Tower Securities\n \nNov. 23, 2022\n \n \n$850.0\n \n \n6.599%\n \n \nJan. 11, 2028\n \n \nNov. 9, 2052\n2024-1C Tower Securities\n \nOct. 11, 2024\n \n \n$1,450.0\n \n \n4.831%\n \n \nOct. 9, 2029\n \n \nOct. 8, 2054\n2024-2C Tower Securities \n(3)\n \nOct. 11, 2024\n \n \n$620.0\n \n \n4.654%\n \n \nOct. 8, 2027\n \n \nOct. 8, 2054\n \n(1)\nInterest paid monthly.\n(2)\nOn January 15, 2025, we repaid the aggregate amount of the 2019-1C Tower Securities.\n(3)\nThe interest rate reflected is the all-in fixed rate which includes the impact of our treasury lock agreement entered on September 11, 2024.

Subsequent to such date, the senior notes become redeemable until maturity at 100% of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem each of the senior notes during the time periods and at the redemption prices set forth in the indentures.\nIndentures Governing Senior Notes\nThe Indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants, subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications, including restrictions on the ability of SBAC and Telecommunications to (1) incur additional indebtedness unless the Consolidated Indebtedness to Annualized Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Indenture), pro forma for the additional indebtedness does not exceed, with respect to any fiscal quarter, 9.5x for SBAC, (2) merge, consolidate, or sell assets, (3) make restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions, (4) enter into transactions with affiliates, and (5) enter into sale and leaseback transactions and restrictions on the ability of the Restricted Subsidiaries of SBAC (as defined in the Indentures) to incur liens securing indebtedness.\nDebt Service\nAs of December 31, 2024, we believe that our cash on hand, capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility, and cash flows from operations for the next twelve months will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt during the next twelve months.\nThe following table illustrates our estimate of our debt service requirement over the next twelve months ended December 31, 2025 based on the amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and the interest rates accruing on those amounts on such date (in thousands):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRevolving Credit Facility\n (1)\n \n$\n 2,800\n2024 Term Loan \n(2)\n \n \n 127,290\n2019-1C Tower Securities \n(3)\n \n \n 1,166,297\n2020-1C Tower Securities\n \n \n 14,368\n2020-2C Tower Securities\n \n \n 14,159\n2021-1C Tower Securities\n \n \n 19,371\n2021-2C Tower Securities\n \n \n 16,752\n2021-3C Tower Securities\n \n \n 23,491\n2022-1C Tower Securities\n \n \n 56,362\n2024-1C Tower Securities\n \n \n 70,510\n2024-2C Tower Securities\n \n \n 29,052\n2020 Senior Notes\n \n \n 58,125\n2021 Senior Notes\n \n \n 46,875\nTotal debt service for the next 12 months\n \n$\n 1,645,452\n \n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2024, no amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.

However, the impact of higher interest rates, has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, our growth rate and future operating results. Higher interest rates have impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to incur capital expenditures at prior levels to expand their networks, which could adversely affect our future revenue growth rates. In addition, increased interest rates may adversely affect our costs to refinance our indebtedness at maturity. In addition, persistent high rates of inflation could adversely affect our future operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by long-term contracts with pre-\n\n\n41\nTable of Contents\n\n\ndetermined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation other than our contracts in South America and Africa which have inflationary index-based rent escalators.",
