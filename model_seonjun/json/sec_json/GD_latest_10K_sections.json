We offer a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; ship construction and repair; land combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; and technology products and services. Our leadership positions in attractive business aviation and defense markets enable us to deliver superior and enduring shareholder returns.\nOur company consists of 10 business units, which are organized into four operating segments: Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems and Technologies. We refer to the latter three collectively as our defense segments. To optimize market focus, customer intimacy, agility and operating expertise, each business unit is responsible for the development and execution of its strategy and operating results. This structure allows for a lean corporate function, which sets the overall strategy and governance for the company and is responsible for allocating and deploying capital.\nOur business units seek to deliver superior operating results by building industry-leading franchises. To achieve this goal, we invest in advanced technologies, pursue a culture of continuous improvement, and strive to be the low-cost, high-quality provider in each of our markets. The result is long-term value creation measured by strong earnings and cash flow and an attractive return on capital.\nOver the past decade, we have invested to create, renew or expand our portfolio of products and services across our businesses. This includes product development investments in Aerospace to bring to market an all-new lineup of business jet aircraft, capital investments in Marine Systems to support significant growth in U.S. Navy ship and submarine construction plans over the next two decades, development of next-generation platforms and technologies to meet customers’ emerging requirements in Combat Systems, and strategic acquisitions to achieve critical mass and build out a complete spectrum of solutions for our Technologies customers. We expect to realize an attractive return from these investments in each of our segments, and we will continue to evaluate our capital deployment opportunities to deliver long-term growth and enduring value to our shareholders.\nFollowing is additional information on each of our operating segments. For a supplemental discussion of segment performance and backlog, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.\nAEROSPACE\nOur Aerospace segment is recognized as a leading producer of business jets and the standard bearer in new technology aircraft, aircraft repair, customer support and custom completion services. The segment consists of our Gulfstream and Jet Aviation business units. We have earned our reputation through:\n•\nsuperior aircraft design, manufacturing excellence, quality, performance, safety and reliability;\n•\ntechnologically advanced flight deck and cabin systems; and\n•\nindustry-leading customer support.\n3\nWe believe the key to long-term value creation in the business jet industry is steady investment in new aircraft models and technologies and in customer service capabilities. Since acquiring Gulfstream more than 20 years ago, we have made significant investments in research and development (R&D), state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, and maintenance and support through a combination of product development efforts, capital expansion and Jet Aviation’s global support network. We are also the industry leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and energy efficient engines.\nWe are committed to continual investment in R&D to create new aircraft that consistently broaden customer offerings while raising the bar for safety and performance. The result is the unprecedented development of an all-new lineup of the most technologically advanced business jet aircraft in the world. The Gulfstream family of aircraft offer industry-leading cabin, cockpit and safety technologies and the longest ranges at the fastest speeds in their respective classes.\nThe following represents Gulfstream’s current product line, along with the maximum range, maximum speed, cabin length (excluding baggage), and total number of city-pair speed records held for each aircraft: \nGulfstream’s in-service aircraft hold 405 city-pair speed records, more than any other business jet manufacturer, including the National Aeronautic Association’s polar and westbound around-the-world speed records.\nThe most recent addition to the in-service Gulfstream fleet is the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G700, which entered service following U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification in March 2024. It combines our most spacious cabin with our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck, the industry’s most technologically advanced flight deck, and the superior high-speed performance of all-new engines to create best-in-class capabilities. \nIn 2021, we introduced two new aircraft, the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G800 and the large-cabin G400, completing a nearly two decade effort to develop an all new family of Gulfstream aircraft. \n4\nBoth aircraft feature our industry-leading high-speed range and efficiency, safety enhancements, and our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck. The G800 is Gulfstream’s longest-range aircraft, with an 8,000 nautical mile range at Mach 0.85. The G800 replaces the G650 and G650ER, which currently operate in 55 countries with more than 580 aircraft of this family in service. The G400 is a clean-sheet (i.e., all new) design developed in concert with the G500 and G600, thus expanding the commonality across the Gulfstream family of aircraft. The G400 will join a market segment in which Gulfstream has not participated for several decades. Both aircraft will enter service following FAA certification. \nThe G500 and G600 entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. These clean sheet aircraft replaced the G450 and G550 models, whose combined family has an installed base of more than 1,650 aircraft around the world. Our investment in the development of these aircraft included a new wing, new avionics, new fuselage and new ergonomically designed larger interiors, as well as systems and technologies to improve the manufacturing process and quality of the aircraft. As a result, the G500 and G600 are faster, more fuel efficient, and have greater cabin volume, reduced emissions, more range and improved flight controls compared with the aircraft they replaced. At year-end 2024, cumulative deliveries of the G500 and G600 aircraft totaled more than 300. \nOur disciplined and consistent approach to new product development has allowed us to introduce repeatedly first-to-market capabilities that set industry standards for safety, performance, quality, speed and comfort. Product enhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics, composites, flight-control and vision systems, acoustics, and cabin technologies.\nGulfstream designs, develops and manufactures aircraft in Savannah, Georgia, including all large-cabin models. The mid-cabin G280 is assembled by a non-U.S. partner. All models are outfitted in Gulfstream’s and Jet Aviation’s facilities. As Gulfstream’s aircraft portfolio and customer base have grown and become increasingly global in reach over the years, we have invested in our facilities and operations around the world. At our Savannah campus, we added new purpose-built manufacturing facilities, increased aircraft service capacity, opened a customer-support distribution center and expanded our R&D capabilities.\nWe offer comprehensive support for the more than 3,000 Gulfstream aircraft in service around the world and operate an extensive network of factory-owned service centers. We continue to invest in these maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities and inventory to accommodate fleet growth. We also operate a 24/7 year-round customer support center and offer on-call Gulfstream aircraft technicians ready to deploy around the world for customer service requirements under our Field and Airborne Support Team (FAST) rapid-response unit.\nIn addition to expanding the reach of Gulfstream’s aircraft maintenance network outside the United States, Jet Aviation provides a comprehensive suite of innovative aircraft services for aircraft owners and operators around the world. With approximately 50 locations throughout North America, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, our offerings include maintenance, completion, aircraft management, charter, staffing and fixed-base operator (FBO) services. \nJet Aviation manages approximately 310 business aircraft globally on behalf of individuals and corporate owners. We operate a leading global FBO network of approximately 30 facilities on four continents and support all aircraft types with a full range of maintenance services, including 24/7 global aircraft-on-ground support. We also operate one of the world’s largest custom completion and refurbishment centers for both narrow- and wide-body aircraft and perform modifications, upgrades and lifecycle sustainment support for various government fleets. We continue to grow our global footprint through acquisitions, expansions and significant renovations in strategic business aviation markets most \n5\nfrequented by these customers. In 2024, we acquired FBO operations in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and broke ground on a new facility in Miami, Florida, at Opa Locka Executive Airport, expanding options in the Upper Midwest and on the East Coast for customers based in and traveling across these regions. \nThe following map displays the broad reach of our combined Gulfstream and Jet Aviation services network, including authorized service centers: \nThe Aerospace segment places a priority on sustainability throughout its manufacturing and service operations, producing aircraft that maximize fuel efficiency while offering customers options to reduce or eliminate their carbon footprints. Gulfstream and Jet Aviation have been at the forefront of the industry by adopting and expanding the availability of SAF, which achieves as much as an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions per gallon over its lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. Gulfstream’s service and test aircraft have flown more than two million nautical miles on SAF since 2016, and in 2019, Gulfstream became the first business jet manufacturer to make SAF available to customers. In November 2023, Gulfstream conducted the world’s first transatlantic flight using 100% SAF. Gulfstream also offers operators the ability to achieve carbon-neutral travel by facilitating the purchase of carbon-offset credits. In addition to actively expanding the availability of SAF at its FBO locations, Jet Aviation allows customers to purchase SAF at locations where it is not available through a book-and-claim system. Since 2019, Jet Aviation has uploaded more than 11 million gallons of blended SAF to its customers.\nRevenue for the Aerospace segment was 24% of our consolidated revenue in 2024, 20% in 2023 and 22% in 2022.

Under cost-reimbursement contracts, the customer reimburses contract costs incurred and pays a fixed, incentive or award-based fee. The amount for an incentive or award fee is determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract, such as cost, quality, schedule and performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials.\nOf our U.S. government revenue, fixed-price contracts accounted for 51% in 2024, 53% in 2023 and 56% in 2022; cost-reimbursement contracts accounted for 43% in 2024, 41% in 2023 and 38% in 2022; and time-and-materials contracts accounted for 6% in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nFor information on the advantages and disadvantages of each of these contract types, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nU.S. COMMERCIAL\nOur U.S. commercial revenue was $6.7 billion in 2024, $5.8 billion in 2023 and $5.7 billion in 2022, which represented 14%, 14% and 15% of our consolidated revenue in each of the respective years. The majority of this revenue was for business jet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries. \nNON-U.S.\nOur revenue from non-U.S. government and commercial customers was $8 billion in 2024, $6.1 billion in 2023 and $6 billion in 2022, which represented 17% of our consolidated revenue in 2024, 14% in 2023 and 15% in 2022.\nWe conduct business with customers around the world. Our non-U.S. defense subsidiaries maintain long-term relationships with their customers and have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers, providing a broad portfolio of products and services.\nOur non-U.S. commercial revenue consists primarily of business jet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services. While the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in North America, orders from \n15\ncustomers outside North America represent a significant portion of our aircraft business with approximately 43% of the Aerospace segment’s aircraft backlog on December 31, 2024.\nCOMPETITION\nSeveral factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and business aviation markets. While customers’ evaluation criteria vary, the principal competitive elements include:\n•\nthe technical excellence, reliability, safety and cost competitiveness of our products and services;\n•\nour ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies that improve mission performance and adapt to dynamic threats;\n•\nsuccessful program execution and on-time delivery of complex, integrated systems;\n•\nour global footprint and accessibility to customers;\n•\nthe reputation and customer confidence derived from past performance; and\n•\nthe successful management of customer relationships.\nDEFENSE MARKET COMPETITION\nThe U.S. government contracts with numerous domestic and non-U.S. companies for products and services. We compete against other contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability. Outside the United States, we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of local, private and state-owned defense manufacturers. Our Marine Systems segment has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the Virginia-class submarine program, and to which it subcontracts on the Columbia-class submarine program. For commercial and repair work, the Marine Systems segment competes with several additional U.S. shipyards. Our Combat Systems segment competes with a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. businesses. Our Technologies segment competes with many companies, from large government contracting and commercial technology companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise. The operating cycle of many of our major programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully.\nWe are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors. Competitions for major defense and other government contracting programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements. Opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program’s integrator, overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team, or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem.\nBUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT MARKET COMPETITION\nThe Aerospace segment has several competitors for each of its Gulfstream products. Key competitive factors include aircraft safety, reliability and performance; comfort and in-flight productivity; service quality, global footprint and responsiveness; technological and new-product innovation; and price. We believe that Gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas.\nThe Aerospace segment competes worldwide in the business jet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of quality, price and timeliness. While competition for each type of service varies somewhat, the segment faces a number of competitors of varying sizes for each of its offerings. \n16\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe develop technology, manufacturing processes and systems-integration practices. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to and from others. The U.S. government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of U.S. government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents. Although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business, no existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nOur company is a global community of approximately 117,000 employees dedicated to our Ethos of transparency, trust, honesty and alignment. These four core values drive how we operate our business; govern how we interact with each other, our customers, partners and suppliers; guide the way that we treat our workforce; and determine how we connect with our communities. Our commitment to ethical business practices is outlined in our \nStandards of Business Ethics and Conduct\n, which states our expectation that all employees conduct business in accordance with our Ethos, applicable laws and our policies. Each employee is asked to acknowledge receipt, understanding of and compliance with our standards.\nDue to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and train skilled and qualified people to design and build the products and perform the services required by our customers. This includes upskilling employees to advance within the workplace. The health, welfare and safety of our employees is paramount throughout our workplaces. This effort starts with treating all employees with dignity and respect and providing them with fair, market-based, competitive and equitable compensation. We recognize and reward the performance of our employees in line with our pay-for-performance philosophy and provide a comprehensive suite of benefit options that aim to enable our employees and their dependents to live healthy and productive lives.\nAcross our businesses, we take measures to prevent workplace hazards, encourage healthy and safe behaviors and enforce a culture of continuous improvement to ensure that our processes help reduce safety incidents and illnesses and comply with applicable health and safety laws.\nWe recognize that our success as a company depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified people. Our commitment to promoting diversity of thought, experience, perspectives, backgrounds and capabilities to drive innovation strengthens the solutions we deliver to our customers. General Dynamics works hard to promote an environment that values and supports all employees. We proudly support a work environment that respects diverse opinions, values individual skills, celebrates unique experiences and cultivates teamwork. These efforts are a demonstration of our dedication to equal employment opportunities that foster and support a principled, productive and inclusive work environment. We stand for basic universal human rights, including that employment must be voluntary. We track, measure and analyze our workforce trends to establish accountability for putting people first across our businesses and at every level of our company.\nOur values motivate us to promote strong workplace practices with opportunities for development and training. Our training and development efforts focus on ensuring that our people are appropriately trained on critical job skills as well as on leadership behaviors that are consistent with our Ethos. We conduct rigorous succession planning exercises to ensure that key positions have the appropriate level of \n17\nbench strength to provide for future key positions and leadership transitions. We listen to our people to assess areas of concern and levels of engagement.\n2024 WORKFORCE STATISTICS\n•\nApproximately 84% of our employees are based in the United States, of which roughly 69% are white, 31% are people of color, 19% are veterans of the U.S. armed forces and 8% have self-reported having a disability. The remaining 16% of our workforce is based internationally in over 65 countries with the primary concentrations being in North America and Europe. Approximately 21% of our workforce is represented by collective bargaining agreements.\n•\nOur global workforce is 76% male and 24% female, and our senior leadership teams across the business are represented by 75% males and 25% females. During 2024, we hired more than 23,800 individuals of which 74% were male and 26% were female. For our approximately 19,400 U.S.-based hires in 2024, 58% were white and 42% were people of color.\nRAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS\nWe depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials, components and subsystems. Our U.S. government customer is a supplier for some of our programs. These supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints, which can put pressure on our costs. Effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance. If our sources of supply are disrupted, particularly in instances where we rely on only one or two sources of supply, or in the event that international conflicts result in the disruption of manufacturing or trade relations for some supply components, our ability to meet our customer commitments could be adversely impacted. We attempt to mitigate risks with our suppliers by entering into long-term agreements and leveraging company-wide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nU.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) govern the majority of our contracts. The FAR mandates uniform policies and procedures for U.S. government acquisitions and purchased services. Also, individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the FAR. For example, the DoD implements the FAR through the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). For all federal government entities, the FAR regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition, including:\n•\nacquisition planning;\n•\ncompetition requirements;\n•\ncontractor qualifications;\n•\nprotection of source selection and supplier information; and\n•\nacquisition procedures.\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews \n18\ncovering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\nNON-U.S. REGULATORY\nOur non-U.S. operations are subject to the applicable government regulations and procurement policies and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\nBUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). For an aircraft to be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness. Aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority, which is often accomplished through a supplemental type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\nENVIRONMENTAL\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency. As a PRP, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination. In cases where we have been designated a PRP, we generally seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate cost-recovery actions. In the unlikely event that we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site, the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other PRPs. We regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters.\nOperating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. Historically, these costs have not been material. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, the timing and effect of which are difficult to assess.\nChanges in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs or facilities and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs. Environmental costs are often recoverable under our contracts with the U.S. government. Based on information currently available and current U.S. government policies relating to cost recovery, we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations, including costs associated with changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters, see Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\n19\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nWe file reports and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2024 compared with 2023 should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, while a discussion of 2023 compared with 2022 can be found in Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. \nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nGLOBAL EVENTS\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused significant disruptions to national and global economies and government activities, including supply chain and staffing challenges. Additionally, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions, export controls and other restrictions targeting Russia and Belarus. Lastly, the impact of the conflict in the Middle East continues to evolve. The disruptions caused by these events continue to impact global economies and businesses, including ours. The primary impact to our business is supply chain challenges, including availability of parts, quality escapes and inflationary pressures.\nIn our Aerospace segment, supply chain challenges paced our ability to ramp up production at the rate we like in response to strong customer demand for our aircraft, causing out-of-sequence manufacturing that increased costs and decreased operational efficiency. In addition, the conflict in the Middle East impacted the delivery schedule for our Israel-based supplier of mid-cabin aircraft. Within our defense segments, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in supply chain challenges that continue to impact our Marine Systems segment. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and increased threat environment have created additional demand for certain of our products and services, particularly in our Combat Systems segment.\nAny longer-term impact of these global events to our business is currently unknown due to the uncertainty around duration and their broader impact. For additional information, see the Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.\nOUR MARKETS\nWith approximately 70% of our revenue from the U.S. government, government spending levels \n—\n particularly defense spending \n—\n influence our financial performance. The Congress has not yet passed a defense appropriations bill for the government’s current fiscal year. However, the government has been operating under a continuing resolution (CR) that provides funding for some federal agencies through March 14, 2025. When the government operates under a CR, all programs of record are funded at the prior year’s appropriated levels until the current year appropriations bill is signed into law. Therefore, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is prohibited from starting new programs or increasing funding on existing programs unless there is an exception for the program included in the CR. The current CR included exceptions allowing the DoD to obligate additional funds for two fiscal year 2024 and one fiscal year 2025 Virginia-class submarines, and for non-executive pay improvements and infrastructure \n32\ninvestments to support the submarine industrial base. In addition, the CR included an exception allowing the DoD to obligate funds for the construction of the second submarine under the existing Columbia-class submarine contract. We do not anticipate the current CR having a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the impact to our business from an extended CR or government shutdown that may result from any continuing delay by Congress to pass a new defense appropriations bill would depend on the duration and government implementation of the CR or shutdown. \nThe long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by the U.S. military’s funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution.\nInternational demand for military equipment and technologies presents opportunities for our non-U.S. operations and exports from our North American businesses. While the revenue potential can be significant, there are risks to doing business in foreign countries, including changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country.\nIn our Aerospace segment, we expect our investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support the segment’s long-term growth. Similarly, we believe our aircraft services business will be a source of steady revenue growth as the global business jet fleet continues to grow.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following paragraphs explain how we recognize revenue and operating costs in our operating segments and the terminology we use to describe our operating results. \nIn the Aerospace segment, we record revenue on contracts for new aircraft when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft. Revenue associated with the segment’s services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Fluctuations in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries, and the level and type of aircraft services performed during the period.\nThe majority of the Aerospace segment’s operating costs relates to new aircraft production on firm orders and consists of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots, recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace segment’s services businesses are recognized generally as incurred.\nFor new aircraft, operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of ultra-large-cabin, large-cabin and mid-cabin aircraft deliveries. Aircraft mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our aircraft models. A new aircraft model typically has lower margins in its initial production lots, and then margins generally increase as we realize efficiencies in the production process. Additional factors affecting the segment’s earnings and margin include the volume, mix and profitability \n33\nof services work performed, the market for pre-owned aircraft, and the level of general and administrative (G&A) and net research and development (R&D) costs incurred by the segment.\nIn the defense segments, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized generally over time as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G&A expenses. Variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts. Because costs are used as a measure of progress, year-over-year variances in costs result in corresponding variances in revenue, which we generally refer to as volume.\nOperating earnings and margin in the defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the estimated costs to complete the contract or both. Therefore, changes in costs incurred in the period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability. It is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value (or vice versa) that the profitability of that contract may be impacted. Contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher- versus lower-margin work. Higher or lower margins can result from a number of factors, including contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) and type of work (e.g., development/production). Contract mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our long-term production contracts. New long-term production contracts typically have lower margins initially, and then margins generally increase as we achieve learning curve improvements or realize other cost reductions.\nCONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW\n2024 IN REVIEW\n•\nStrong operating performance:\n◦\nRevenue of $47.7 billion, an increase of 12.9% from 2023\n◦\nOperating earnings of $4.8 billion, an increase of 13% from 2023, with sequential growth throughout the year\n◦\nDiluted earnings per share of $13.63, up 13.4% from 2023\n◦\nCash provided by operating activities of $4.1 billion, or 109% of net earnings\n•\nBacklog of $90.6 billion, supporting our long-term growth expectations:\n◦\nStrong Gulfstream aircraft order activity, including orders across all aircraft models\n◦\nSeveral significant contract awards received in our defense segments, including $3.7 billion of combined awards from the U.S. Navy for advance procurement and other work for the Virginia-class submarine program\n34\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\nVariance\nRevenue\n$\n47,716 \n$\n42,272 \n$\n5,444 \n12.9 \n%\nOperating costs and expenses\n(42,920)\n(38,027)\n(4,893)\n12.9 \n%\nOperating earnings\n4,796 \n4,245 \n551 \n13.0 \n%\nOperating margin\n10.1 \n%\n10.0 \n%\nOur consolidated revenue increased in 2024 driven by growth across all segments, including double digit percentage growth in our Aerospace and Marine Systems segments.

Ship services revenue increased due to higher volume on the Columbia-class submarine program. The primary drivers of the increase in service operating costs were the changes in volume on the programs described above.\nG&A EXPENSES\nAs a percentage of revenue, G&A expenses decreased to 5.4% in 2024 compared with 5.7% in 2023 due to growth in revenue. We expect G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2025 to be generally consistent with 2024.\nOTHER, NET\nNet other income was $68 in 2024 and $82 in 2023 and represents primarily the non-service components of pension and other post-retirement benefits. In 2025, we expect net other income to be approximately $50.\nINTEREST, NET\nNet interest expense was $324 in 2024 and $343 in 2023. See Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including interest rates. We expect 2025 net interest expense to be consistent with 2024.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAX, NET\nOur effective tax rate was 16.7% in 2024 and 16.8% in 2023. For further discussion, including a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate, see Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. For 2025, we expect a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 17.5%, generally consistent with our original expectations for 2024 before declining due to certain U.S. and foreign tax credits and benefits and other timing items.\nBACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE\nOur total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $90.6 billion on December 31, 2024, compared to $93.6 billion at the end of 2023. Our total backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts with customers as discussed in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Our total estimated contract value, which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value, was $144 billion on December 31, 2024.\n39\nThe following table details the backlog and estimated potential contract value of each segment at the end of 2024 and 2023:\nFunded\nUnfunded\nTotal Backlog\nEstimated Potential Contract Value\nTotal \nEstimated Contract Value\nDecember 31, 2024\nAerospace\n$\n18,895 \n$\n798 \n$\n19,693 \n$\n1,132 \n$\n20,825 \nMarine Systems\n30,530 \n9,288 \n39,818 \n9,560 \n49,378 \nCombat Systems\n16,142 \n838 \n16,980 \n8,647 \n25,627 \nTechnologies\n9,577 \n4,529 \n14,106 \n34,029 \n48,135 \nTotal\n$\n75,144 \n$\n15,453 \n$\n90,597 \n$\n53,368 \n$\n143,965 \nDecember 31, 2023\nAerospace\n$\n19,557 \n$\n897 \n$\n20,454 \n$\n451 \n$\n20,905 \nMarine Systems\n30,141 \n15,755 \n45,896 \n3,647 \n49,543 \nCombat Systems\n13,816 \n721 \n14,537 \n6,236 \n20,773 \nTechnologies\n8,961 \n3,779 \n12,740 \n28,011 \n40,751 \nTotal\n$\n72,475 \n$\n21,152 \n$\n93,627 \n$\n38,345 \n$\n131,972 \nFor additional information about our major products and services in backlog see the Business discussion contained in Item 1.\nAEROSPACE\nAerospace funded backlog represents primarily new aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers. Unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Aerospace segment ended 2024 with backlog of $19.7 billion. \nOrders in 2024 reflected strong demand across our portfolio of products and services, including orders for all models of Gulfstream aircraft. The segment’s book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenue) was 1-to-1 in 2024, even as revenue grew by more than 30% year over year.\nBeyond total backlog, estimated potential contract value represents primarily options and other agreements with existing customers to purchase new aircraft and long-term aircraft services agreements. On December 31, 2024, estimated potential contract value in the Aerospace segment was $1.1 billion. \nDemand for Gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions, generating orders from public and privately held companies, individuals, and governments around the world. Geographically, U.S. customers represented 54% of the segment’s orders in 2024 and 56% of the segment’s backlog on December 31, 2024, demonstrating continued strong domestic demand.\n40\nThe following represents Gulfstream aircraft (in units) in backlog by region on December 31, 2024:\nDEFENSE SEGMENTS\nThe total backlog in our defense segments represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of total backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by customers, as well as commitments by international customers that are approved and funded similarly by their governments. The unfunded portion of total backlog includes the amounts we believe are likely to be funded, but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide the same funding level currently anticipated for a given program.\nEstimated potential contract value in our defense segments includes unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts and unfunded work on indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Contract options represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. For IDIQ contracts, we evaluate the amount of funding we expect to receive and include this amount in our estimated potential contract value. This amount is often less than the total IDIQ contract value, particularly when the contract has multiple awardees. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value.\nTotal backlog in our defense segments was $70.9 billion on December 31, 2024, compared with $73.2 billion at year-end 2023. In 2024, the total book-to-bill ratio in our defense segments was 1-to-1. Estimated potential contract value in our defense segments was $52.2 billion on December 31, 2024, up 37.8% compared with $37.9 billion at year-end 2023. \n41\nMARINE SYSTEMS\nThe Marine Systems segment’s backlog consists of very long-term submarine and surface ship construction programs, as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts. The segment’s total estimated contract value remained steady compared with year-end 2023.\nSignificant contract awards in the Marine Systems segment during 2024 include:\n•\n$780 from the U.S. Navy for the construction of an additional John Lewis-class (T-AO-205) fleet replenishment oiler. The contract including options for an additional seven T-AO-205 oilers has a maximum potential value of more than $6.7 billion.\n•\n$2.9 billion from the Navy for long-lead materials for Block V and Block VI Virginia-class submarines.\n•\n$205 from the Navy for planning yard services for the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyer program. The contract including options has a maximum potential value of $1.1 billion.\n•\n$770 from the Navy for lead yard services, development studies, design and engineering efforts, procurement and delivery of initial spare parts to support maintenance availabilities for Virginia-class submarines.\n•\n$530 from the Navy to provide maintenance, modernization and repair services for the DDG-51 destroyer, USS Hartford Los Angeles-class submarine and Wasp-class amphibious assault ship programs.\n•\n$455 from the Navy to provide engineering, technical, design and planning yard support services for operational strategic and attack submarines.\n•\n$255 for future technology development on the next-generation attack submarine, SSN(X), program for the Navy.\n•\n$115 for advanced nuclear plant studies (ANPS) in support of the Columbia-class submarine program.\n•\n$55 from the Navy to support non-nuclear maintenance on submarines based at the New England Naval Submarine Support Facility. \n42\nThe following represents the Marine Systems segment’s total estimated contract value by major program on December 31, 2024:\n \nCOMBAT SYSTEMS\nThe Combat Systems segment’s backlog consists of a mix of U.S. and international combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions programs. The vehicle programs are generally long-term franchise programs, while the weapons systems and munitions programs tend to be shorter-term in nature. The segment’s backlog was up 16.8% from year-end 2023 to $17 billion. The segment’s estimated potential contract value was $8.6 billion on December 31, 2024, compared with $6.2 billion at year-end 2023.\nSignificant contract awards in the Combat Systems segment during 2024 include:\n•\n$2 billion for various munitions and ordnance. These contracts have a maximum potential value of $3.2 billion.\n•\nAn IDIQ contract to provide medium-caliber ammunition cartridges for the U.S. Army. The contract has a maximum potential value of $3 billion among two awardees.\n•\n$1.6 billion from the Army to produce 155mm artillery projectile metal parts and propelling bag charges and establish additional capacity for artillery propellant. The contracts have a maximum potential value of $2.5 billion.\n•\n$1.3 billion for the production of Pandur 6x6 wheeled combat vehicles from the Austrian Federal Ministry of Defense. The contract including options has a maximum potential value of $2 billion.\n•\nTwo contracts from the Canadian government for the Logistics Vehicle Modernization (LVM) program to provide a new fleet of light and heavy armored vehicles and logistics support services for the Canadian Army. These contracts including options have a maximum potential value of $1.9 billion. The scope of the work is shared with an industry partner. \n•\n$605 from the Army for Stryker vehicle upgrades, systems technical support and inventory management. The contracts have a maximum potential value of $1.1 billion. \n43\n•\n$350 from the Army for Abrams main battle tank upgrades, engineering and logistics support services, and system and sustainment technical support services.\n•\n$325 from the Army for the third phase of the low-rate initial production (LRIP) of the M10 Booker Combat Vehicle.\n•\n$325 from the Canadian government to produce armored combat support vehicles (ACSVs).\n•\n$285 to produce Abrams main battle tanks in the system enhancement package version 3 (SEPv3) configuration for Romania. \n•\n$280 from the Army to produce Stryker Sgt. Stout vehicles and provide long-lead materials to support the future retrofit of the vehicles to a dual Stinger Vehicle Universal Launcher (SVUL) configuration.\nThe following represents the Combat Systems segment’s total estimated contract value by market on December 31, 2024:\nTECHNOLOGIES\nThe Technologies segment’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and task orders across a mix of U.S. and non-U.S. government and commercial customers. These contracts can be shorter-cycle or span multiple years, but commonly include a smaller, initially funded order. Therefore, our estimated potential contract value of $34 billion is an important indicator of future orders and revenue. In 2024, approximately 75% of the segment’s orders were from additional work on IDIQ contracts or the exercise of options. The segment’s total estimated contract value was $48.1 billion on December 31, 2024, up 18.1% compared with $40.8 billion at year-end 2023.\n44\nSignificant contract awards in the Technologies segment during 2024 include:\n•\n$50 from the U.S. Air Force to modernize, integrate and operate the DoD’s Mission Partner Environments (MPEs), enabling the military and its partners to securely communicate and share real-time information at multiple levels of classification. The contract has a maximum potential value of $5.6 billion.\n•\n$2.2 billion for several key classified contracts. These contracts have a maximum potential value of $4.4 billion.\n•\nA contract from the U.S. Space Force to provide sustainment services for the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) satellite communications system. The contract has a maximum potential value of $2.2 billion.\n•\nFour IDIQ contracts from the Canadian government to support the Land Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) system for the Canadian Army. The contracts have a maximum potential value of $1.3 billion.\n•\n$125 to modernize the U.S. Central Command’s (CENTCOM) enterprise IT infrastructure. The contract including options has a maximum potential value of $920.\n•\n$140 from the Navy to manufacture and test various components for MK54 torpedoes and for general engineering services. The contract including options has a maximum potential value of $810.\n•\n$340 from the Navy to provide full life cycle and operational support for the Trident II Fire Control System (FCS) onboard Ohio-class submarines and continue the development, production and installation of FCS for all new Columbia-class submarines. The contract including options has a maximum potential value of $620.\n•\n$605 for multiple awards from the U.S. Space Development Agency (SDA) to develop and integrate ground systems for the low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite network. \n•\n$205 from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services to operate its Medicaid Management Information System. The contract including options has a maximum potential value of $525. \n•\n$515 from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) to provide hybrid cloud services and IT design, engineering, and operations and sustainment services.\n•\n$280 for two awards from the New York State Department of Health to operate and modernize the state’s health insurance exchange and to support and enhance the state’s Medicaid Management Information System. These contracts including options have a maximum potential value of $480.\n•\n$235 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide cloud services and software tools and to support the Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center. The contracts including options have a maximum potential value of $470.\n•\n$115 from the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) under the Veterans Intake, Conversion and Communications Services (VICCS) program to digitally convert historical veteran records and automate data extraction of existing records. The contract including options has a maximum potential value of $345.\n45\nThe following represents the Technologies segment’s total estimated contract value by customer on December 31, 2024:\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation, which is underpinned by an operating discipline focused on cost control and working capital management. This emphasis gives us the flexibility for prudent capital deployment, while allowing us to maintain an appropriate debt level, and preserves a strong balance sheet for future opportunities. \nWe evaluate a variety of capital deployment options based on current market conditions and our long-term outlook, and we believe agility is a key component of our capital deployment strategy as market conditions change over time. Our capital deployment priorities include investments in our business infrastructure, products and services to drive long-term growth, a predictable dividend, strategic acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases. \nWe believe cash generated by operating activities, supplemented by commercial paper issuances, is sufficient to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs. An additional potential source of capital is the issuance of long-term debt in capital market transactions. \n46\nWe ended 2024 with a cash and equivalents balance of $1.7 billion compared with $1.9 billion at the end of 2023. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities in 2024 and 2023, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in Item 8:\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n4,112 \n$\n4,710 \nNet cash used by investing activities\n(953)\n(941)\nNet cash used by financing activities\n(3,369)\n(3,094)\nOPERATING ACTIVITIES\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in 2024\n \ncompared with\n \n$4.7 billion in 2023\n. \nThe primary driver of cash flows in both years was net earnings. Cash flows in 2024 were affected negatively by growth in operating working capital, particularly driven by the ramp-up in production of new Gulfstream aircraft models, offset partially by an increase in customer deposits driven by Gulfstream aircraft orders in our Aerospace segment. Cash flows in 2023 were affected positively by a decrease in unbilled receivables due to the receipt of progress payments on large international vehicle contracts in our Combat Systems segment and an increase in customer deposits driven by Gulfstream aircraft orders, offset partially by an increase in inventory due primarily to the ramp-up in production of new Gulfstream aircraft models.\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES\nCash used by investing activities was $953 in 2024 and $941 in 2023. Our investing activities include cash paid for capital expenditures and business acquisitions; purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities; and proceeds from asset sales.\nCapital Expenditures.\n The primary use of cash for investing activities in both years was capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $916 in 2024 and\n \n$904 in 2023. Capital expenditures include equipment and facility enhancements to support new and existing programs across our businesses.\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES\nCash used by financing activities was $3.4 billion in 2024 and $3.1 billion in 2023. Financing activities include the use of cash for repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends, and debt and commercial paper repayments. Our financing activities also include proceeds received from debt and commercial paper issuances and employee stock option exercises. \nDividends.\n On March 6, 2024, our board of directors (Board) declared an increased quarterly dividend of $1.42 per share, the 27th consecutive annual increase. Previously, the Board had increased the quarterly dividend to $1.32 per share in March 2023. Cash dividends paid were $1.5 billion in 2024 and $1.4 billion\n \nin 2023.\nShare Repurchases.\n Our Board from time to time authorizes management’s repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market. On December 4, 2024, the Board authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million additional shares of the company’s outstanding stock. We paid $1.5 billion and $434 in 2024 and 2023, respectively, to repurchase our outstanding \n47\nshares. On December 31, 2024, 9.2 million shares remained authorized by our Board for repurchase, representing 3.4% of our total shares outstanding.\nDebt Issuances and Repayments.\n In November 2024, we repaid fixed-rate notes of $500, and in May and August 2023, we repaid fixed-rate notes of $750 and $500, respectively, all at their respective scheduled maturities using cash on hand. Fixed-rate notes of $750 mature in both April and May 2025. We currently plan to repay these notes at maturity using cash on hand, potentially supplemented by commercial paper or other borrowings. For additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates, see Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nOn December 31, 2024, we had no commercial paper outstanding, but we maintain the ability to access the commercial paper market in the future. Separately, we have a $4 billion committed bank credit facility for general corporate purposes and working capital needs and to support our commercial paper issuances. We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that allows us to access the debt markets.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. As described below, we use free cash flow and return on invested capital (ROIC) to measure our performance in these areas. While we believe these metrics provide useful information, they are not defined operating measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and there are limitations associated with their use. Our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. As a result, the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP measures.\nFree Cash Flow.\n We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles free cash flow with net cash from operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in Item 8:\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n4,112 \n$\n4,710 \n$\n4,579 \nCapital expenditures\n(916)\n(904)\n(1,114)\nFree cash flow\n$\n3,196 \n$\n3,806 \n$\n3,465 \nCash flows as a percentage of net earnings:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n109 \n%\n142 \n%\n135 \n%\nFree cash flow\n85 \n%\n115 \n%\n102 \n%\nReturn on Invested Capital.\n We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as net earnings plus after-tax interest and amortization expense, calculated using the \n48\nstatutory federal income tax rate. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and average shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss. Average debt and average shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss are calculated using the respective balances at the end of the preceding year and the respective balances at the end of each of the four quarters of the year presented. ROIC excludes goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance.\nROIC is calculated as follows:\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet earnings\n$\n3,782 \n$\n3,315 \n$\n3,390 \nAfter-tax interest expense\n310 \n315 \n309 \nAfter-tax amortization expense\n191 \n201 \n235 \nNet operating profit after taxes\n$\n4,283 \n$\n3,831 \n$\n3,934 \nAverage invested capital\n$\n32,451 \n$\n31,258 \n$\n31,260 \nReturn on invested capital\n13.2 \n%\n12.3 \n%\n12.6 \n%\nCASH REQUIREMENTS\nThe following is a discussion of how we expect to meet the future cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations. \nThe majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. We similarly enter into long-term agreements with suppliers and subcontractors for goods and services in support of these contracts and programs with payment terms that are generally aligned with the payment terms from our customers. In some instances, we require advance payments or deposits from our customers, which help fund our purchase commitments and reduce the risk of customer performance.\nAdditionally, we have significant liabilities under our defined benefit retirement plans. As these liabilities are settled using plan assets, our future cash requirements associated with these liabilities are generally limited to the annual cash contributions to these plans required in accordance with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations. See Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information. \nOther obligations, such as scheduled principal and interest payments on our fixed-rate notes, and scheduled payments in accordance with our lease agreements are expected to be satisfied using cash generated from operations. See Notes J and K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information.\nADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue \n49\nand expenses during the reporting period. We employ judgment in making our estimates, but they are based on historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts our results of operations for all periods presented. \nIn our opinion, the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application:\nRevenue. \nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account for revenue. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time.\nSubstantially all of our revenue in the defense segments is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customers. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. \nMost of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our Aerospace segment. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft.\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs. We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. For discussion of our contract estimates, the assumptions used, and the impact of changes in estimates, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nConsistent with industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term contracts as current, even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year. The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nLong-lived Assets and Goodwill. \nWe review long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets over the estimated fair value as determined by discounted cash flows.\nGoodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting units or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50%. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. Our reporting \n50\nunits are consistent with our operating segments in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. When determining the approach to be used, we consider the current facts and circumstances of each reporting unit as well as the excess of each reporting unit’s estimated fair value over its carrying value based on our most recent quantitative assessments. Our qualitative approach evaluates the business environment and various events impacting the reporting unit including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, changes in the business environment and reporting unit-specific events. If, based on the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, then a quantitative assessment is not necessary. However, if a quantitative assessment is determined to be necessary, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and, if necessary, recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. \nOur estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value is based primarily on the discounted cash flows of the underlying operations and requires the use of judgment by management. The process requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows, and terminal-value growth rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows. Due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis. To assess the reasonableness of our discounted cash flows, we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization. Additionally, we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit’s fair value by comparing the fair value to peer companies and recent relevant market transactions.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we completed qualitative assessments for each of our reporting units. Our Aerospace, Marine Systems and Combat Systems reporting units’ estimated fair values significantly exceeded their respective carrying values based on our most recent quantitative assessments, which were performed in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our Technologies reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 25% at the time of our last quantitative assessment in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our qualitative assessments this year did not present indicators of impairment.\nCommitments and Contingencies. \nWe are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the normal course of business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known.\nRetirement Plans. \nOur pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates, which are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. For a discussion of our assumptions and any changes to these assumptions, as well as the impact of these changes, which is reported as an actuarial gain or loss in the reconciliation of the change in the benefit obligation, see Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The key assumption is the interest rates used to discount estimated future pension benefits. We base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period. The effect of a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption on the December 31, 2024, pension benefit obligation is ($261) or $272, respectively.\n51\nAs described in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs until such costs can be allocated to contracts. Therefore, the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the retirement benefit cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results.\nGUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe outstanding notes described in Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, issued by General Dynamics Corporation (the parent), are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured, joint and several basis by several of the parent’s 100%-owned subsidiaries (the guarantors). The guarantee of each guarantor ranks equally in right of payment with all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of such guarantor. A listing of the guarantors is included in an exhibit to this Form 10-K.\nBecause the parent is a holding company, its cash flow and ability to service its debt, including the outstanding notes, depends on the performance of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to distribute cash to the parent, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the outstanding notes have a direct claim only against the parent and the guarantors.\nUnder the relevant indenture, the guarantee of each guarantor is limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without rendering the guarantee voidable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. Each indenture also provides that, in the event (1) of a merger, consolidation or sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a guarantor (other than a transaction with the parent or any of its subsidiaries) or (2) there occurs a transfer, sale or other disposition of the voting stock of a guarantor so that the guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of the parent, then the guarantor or the entity acquiring the assets (in the event of the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a guarantor) will be released and relieved of any obligations under the guarantee.\nThe following summarized financial information presents the parent and guarantors (collectively, the combined obligor group) on a combined basis. The summarized financial information of the combined obligor group excludes net investment in and earnings of subsidiaries related to interests held by the combined obligor group in subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes.\nSTATEMENT OF EARNINGS INFORMATION\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\nRevenue\n$\n18,701 \nOperating costs and expenses, excluding G&A\n(16,638)\nNet earnings\n785 \n52\nBALANCE SHEET INFORMATION\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash and equivalents\n$\n474 \n$\n986 \nOther current assets\n5,187 \n5,012 \nNoncurrent assets\n4,841 \n4,506 \nTotal assets\n$\n10,502 \n$\n10,504 \nShort-term debt and current portion of long-term debt\n$\n1,500 \n$\n503 \nOther current liabilities\n3,016 \n2,890 \nLong-term debt\n7,210 \n8,700 \nOther noncurrent liabilities\n3,170 \n3,281 \nTotal liabilities\n$\n14,896 \n$\n15,374 \nThe summarized balance sheet information presented above includes the funded status of the company’s primary qualified U.S. government pension plans as the parent has the ultimate obligation for the plans.",
