We connect consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions secure, simple, smart and accessible.  We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®.  We operate a payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and our customers.  Through our unique and proprietary global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions.  We have additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments).  Using these capabilities, we offer consumer and commercial payment products, capture new payment flows and provide services and solutions.  These services and solutions include, among others, security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement services, and business and market insights, all of which draw on our principled and responsible use of secure data\n.\n  Our capabilities strengthen, reinforce and complement each other and are fundamentally interdependent.  For our global payments network, our franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them.  We employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which we operate.\nFor a full discussion of our business, please see page 10.\nOur Performance\nThe following are our key financial and operational highlights for 2024, including growth rates over the prior year:\nGAAP\nNet revenue\nNet income\nDiluted EPS\n$28.2B\n$12.9B\n$13.89\nup 12%\nup 15%\nup 17%\nNon-GAAP \n1\n (currency-neutral)\nAdjusted net revenue\nAdjusted net income\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$28.2B\n$13.5B\n$14.60\nup 13%\nup 18%\nup 21%\n$13.4B\n$11.0B\nRepurchased shares\n$14.8B\nin capital returned\n \nto stockholders\n$2.4B\nDividends paid\ncash flows\n \nfrom operations\nGross dollar volume\n(growth on a local currency basis)\nCross-border volume growth \n(on a local currency basis)\nSwitched transactions\n$9.8T\nup 18%\n159.4B\nup 11%\nup 11%\n1\nNon-GAAP results (including growth rates) exclude the impact of gains and losses on equity investments, Special Items and/or foreign currency.

BUSINESS\nOur Strategic Priorities\nConsumer payments. \n We focus on enabling consumer payments, providing consumers with choice and flexibility to transact across multiple payment rails (including cards, real-time payments and account-based transactions), while ensuring that all payments are safe, secure and seamless.  We do so by:\n•\nCapturing the significant secular opportunity\n \nof cash displacement by increasing acceptance through advancing technology and partnering with players across the payments ecosystem, as well as by opening up closed-loop and domestic networks.  We also pursue incremental volume and transactions by extending our reach across under-penetrated card verticals (such as bill pay) and real-time account-based payments\n•\nDriving brand preference through compelling consumer experiences\n by offering relevant value propositions to consumers (including features, benefits and experiences), providing comprehensive digital functionality (such as Digital First), delivering enhanced security and functionality (increasing tokenization, scaling authentication and streamlining online checkout) and driving increased approval, spend and activation rates\n•\nInvesting in the future and driving market transformation\n \nby extending the reach of our network to enable the tokenization of credentials, identities, assets and data and the exchange of those items between counterparties (providing security, privacy and control).  We also seek to achieve this transformation by modernizing our card switch to meet evolving needs \nCommercial and new payment flows.\n  We focus on capturing opportunities in commercial payments (both point-of-sale purchases and invoiced payments) and disbursements and remittances (specifically, through Mastercard Move, our collection of money movement capabilities that provides solutions for money transfers to consumers from consumers, businesses or governments).  We do so by:\n•\nAccelerating secular shift in commercial point-of-sale purchases\n \nby offering differentiated propositions across cards and platforms (both corporate and small business solutions, including expense management, reporting, reconciliation and data insights); expanding distribution of our point-of-sale offerings across financial institutions, new geographies, new channels and small businesses; and growing acceptance\n•\nCapturing commercial invoiced payments\n by driving engagement across buyers and suppliers to, among other things, simplify workflows, release working capital and improve data reconciliation to reduce end-to-end costs; building on our travel offerings to expand into additional select verticals (including business-to-business (“B2B”) marketplaces, trade and logistics, healthcare, consumer packaged goods and pharmaceuticals); and embedding payments into widely used platforms and workflows \n \n•\nModernizing disbursements and remittances\n by utilizing Mastercard Move to scale use cases across senders (including consumers, businesses and governments) and receiving consumers (both domestic and cross-border) and expand money movement across our global network of financial institution partners\nServices and other solutions.\n  Our services and other solutions, which are interdependent with our payment network, drive value for our customers and the broader payments ecosystem.  We offer security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement, business and market insights, gateway, processing and open banking, among other services and solutions (including ACH batch and real-time account-based payments and solutions).\n \nAs we drive value, our services and other solutions generate revenue while helping to accelerate our overall financial performance.  We do so by:\n•\nDifferentiating our payments capabilities\n by combining our wide range of services and solutions in various ways to meet the needs and priorities of our\n \npartners, which helps drive market wins and payments growth \n•\nEnhancing and expanding our suite of services\n to better serve our existing customers, including across new buying centers and new capability areas, as well as to reach new customers \n•\nScaling distribution\n by using our technology platforms to enable us to switch more transactions and deliver more services per transaction, selling directly to customers through a dedicated sales force and global account teams, and embedding services with partners (such as tech platforms, system integrators, processors and other networks) to deliver those services at scale\n \n8\n     MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOur priorities are fundamentally interdependent and strengthen, reinforce and complement each other.  \n      \n•\nOur payments network helps us scale our services and solutions, and those services and solutions help us differentiate our payments solutions\n•\nWe grow in payments, which allows us to switch more transactions and bring more transaction data onto the network\n•\nWe use that data to create insightful services and solutions that can, in turn, help us win new and renewed customer deals and drive greater payments volume growth\nEnabling Our Success\nThese priorities are supported by six enablers:\nPeople.\n  Our success is driven by the skills, experience, integrity and mindset of our people.  We attract, develop and retain top talent, in alignment with our strategic priorities.  Our winning culture is guided by the Mastercard Way, which outlines the behaviors we expect from employees to deliver for our customers and one another.  We foster a working environment that benefits and provides equal opportunities for all of our employees, where people have opportunities to perform purpose-driven work that advances our business objectives by delivering a positive impact on communities, customers and co-workers across the globe.\nBrand.  \nOur brands and brand identities serve as a differentiator for our business, representing our values and enabling us to accelerate growth in new areas. \nData and AI.  \nWe create a range of products and services for our customers using our data and artificial intelligence (“AI”) assets, technology, platforms and expertise.  We follow our Data and Tech Responsibility Principles in how we design, implement and deliver those solutions.  Our Privacy by Design, Data by Design and AI Governance processes are designed to ensure we embed multiple layers of privacy, data protection and information security controls in all our products and services, keeping a clear focus on protecting customers’ and individuals’ data and privacy. \nTechnology. \n Our technology provides resiliency, scalability and flexibility in how we serve customers.  It unlocks broader reach to scale digital payment services to multiple channels.  Utilizing our technology standards, services and governance model, we connect financial institutions, financial technology companies (fintechs) and others, enabling interoperability and allowing consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to engage through digital channels.\nFranchise.  \nWe manage an ecosystem of stakeholders who participate in our global payments network.  Our franchise model creates and sustains a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem.  We provide a balanced ecosystem where all participants benefit from the availability, innovation and safety and security of our network.  Our franchise model enables the scale of our network and provides a single governance structure for its operation.  This structure has the potential to be extended to new opportunities.  \nDoing Well by Doing Good.\n  Sustainable impact is fundamental to our business strategy.  We leverage our employees, technology, resources, partnerships and expertise to address social, economic and environmental challenges, while at the same time creating markets for future growth and driving long-term value for stockholders.  Our environmental, social and governance priorities are expressed through three pillars - People, Prosperity, Planet - and all of the work we do is grounded in strong governance principles.  For more information, please reference our most recently published Environmental, Social and Governance Report located on our website.   \n \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K     \n9\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOur Business\nOur Payments Capabilities \nWe enable a wide variety of payments capabilities (including products, services and solutions) over our network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, governments and others, offering our customers one partner for their payment needs.  \nPayment Network\nOur payment network links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use our products at approximately 150 million acceptance locations and over 250 million digital access points worldwide.  This network facilitates an efficient, safe and secure means for making and receiving payments, a convenient, quick and secure payment method for consumers to access their funds and a channel for businesses to receive insight through information that is derived from our network.  We enable transactions for our customers through our payment network in more than 150 currencies and in more than 220 countries and territories.  \nPayment Network Transactions.\n  Our payment network supports what is often referred to as a “four-party” payments network and includes the following participants: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuer (the account holder’s financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution).  \nWe do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our products.  In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers. \nThe following graphic depicts a typical transaction on our payment network and our role in that transaction, which includes services and other solutions and payments ecosystem security:\nIn a typical transaction, an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products.  After the transaction is authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below) and other applicable fees, and then posts the transaction to the account holder’s account.  The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the “merchant discount” rate), to the merchant.\n•\nInterchange Fees.\n  Interchange fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs and benefits that consumers and merchants derive.  Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred.  These costs are incurred by issuers in providing services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants, whose participation in the network enables increased sales to their existing and new customers, efficiencies in the delivery of existing and new products, guaranteed payments and improved customer experience.  We (or, alternatively, financial institutions) establish “default interchange fees” that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer.  We administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.\n \n10\n     MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\n•\nAdditional Four-Party System Fees.\n \n The merchant discount rate is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both participating in the four-party system and providing services to merchants.  The rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer.  Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate.  Issuers may also charge account holders fees for the transaction, including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit. \nSwitched Transactions \n•\nAuthorization, Clearing and Settlement.\n  Through our payment network, we enable the routing of a transaction to the issuer for its approval, facilitate the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a successfully conducted transaction, and settle the transaction by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties via settlement banks chosen by us and our customers.\n•\nCross-Border and Domestic. \n Our payment network switches transactions throughout the world when the merchant country and country of issuance are different (“cross-border transactions”), providing account holders with the ability to use, and merchants to accept, our products and services across country borders.  We also provide switched transaction services to customers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same (“domestic transactions”).  We switch approximately 70% of all transactions for Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, including nearly all cross-border transactions.\nKey 2024 Developments\n•\nIn 2024, we began processing domestic transactions in China through our joint venture.  Mastercard-branded cards are now accepted for both domestic and cross-border purchases.\nWe guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to acquirers to help ensure the integrity of our payment network.  We refer to the amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure.  We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances.\nPayment Network Architecture. \n Our payment network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers, enabling them to expand into regional and global markets.  It is based largely on a distributed (peer-to-peer) architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction.  The network accomplishes this by performing intelligent routing and applying multiple services (such as fraud scoring, tokenization services, etc.) to appropriate transactions in real time.  This architecture enables us to connect all parties regardless of where or how the transaction is occurring.  It has 24-hour a day availability and world-class response time.\nAccount-Based Payments Capabilities\nWe offer ACH batch and real-time account-based payments capabilities, enabling payments for ACH transactions between bank accounts in real-time.  Our real-time account-based payments capabilities provide consumers and businesses the ability to make instant (faster) payments while providing enhanced data and messaging capabilities.  We build, implement, enhance and operate real-time clearing and settlement infrastructure, payment platforms and direct debit systems for jurisdictions globally.  We operate real-time payments infrastructure in several countries around the world.  We also use our real-time account-based payments capabilities to enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money directly from account to account.  \nWe discuss below under “Our Payment Products and Applications” the ways in which we apply our real-time account-based payments capabilities to capture new payment flows. \nSecurity and Franchise\nPayments Ecosystem Security. \n We employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem, including a robust program designed to protect our network from cyber and information security threats.  Our network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and security protection.  Our programs are assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants.  We engage in many efforts to mitigate information security challenges, including maintaining an information security program, an enterprise resilience program and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities.  We work with experts across the organization (as well as through other sources such as public-private partnerships) to monitor and respond quickly to a range of cyber and physical threats, including threats and incidents associated with the use of services provided by third-party providers.\n \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K     \n11\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nAs another feature of our multi-layered approach, we work with issuers, acquirers, merchants, governments and payments industry associations to develop and put in place technical standards for safe and secure transactions, and we provide solutions and products that are designed to help provide safety and security for the global payments ecosystem.  Our approach includes supporting small businesses by sharing best practices and providing access to free utilities and services, benefiting both them and the entire payments ecosystem.  We discuss specific security solutions that we offer to our customers below under “Services and Other Solutions”. \nOur Franchise.\n  We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our global payments network, setting standards and rules for all participants and aiming to ensure interoperability among them while balancing risk and value across all stakeholders.  Our franchise model achieves this by creating and sustaining a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem.  Through our franchise model, we work to ensure a balanced ecosystem where all participants may benefit from the availability, innovation, safety and security of our network.  We achieve this goal through the following key activities: \n•\nParticipant Onboarding.\n \nWe determine that each new customer meets the necessary prerequisites to use and contribute to our network by defining clear ecosystem roles and responsibilities for their operations\n•\nOperating Standards.\n \nWe define the technical, operational and financial standards that all network participants are required to uphold\n•\nSafety and Security.\n \nWe establish central principles, including safeguarding consumer protections and integrity, so participants feel confident to transact on the network \n•\nResponsible Stewardship.\n \nWe set performance standards to support ecosystem optimization and growth and use proactive monitoring designed to both ensure participant adherence to operating standards and protect the integrity of the ecosystem\n•\nIssue Resolution.\n \nWe operate a framework to address disputes between our network participants\nOur Payment Products and Applications \nConsumer Payments \nWe provide a wide variety of products and services that support payment products that customers can offer to consumers and merchants.  These offerings facilitate transactions across our payments network and platforms among account holders, merchants, financial institutions, digital partners, businesses, governments and other organizations in markets globally.  \nConsumer Credit.\n  We offer products that enable issuers to provide consumers with credit, allowing them to defer payment.  These programs are designed to meet the needs of our customers around the world and address standard, premium and affluent consumer segments.\nHow We Benefit Consumers\nWe enable our customers to benefit consumers by:\n•\nmaking electronic payments more convenient, secure and efficient\n•\ndelivering better, seamless consumer experiences\n•\nproviding consumers choice, empowering them to make and receive payments in the ways that best meet their daily needs\n•\nprotecting consumers and all other participants in a transaction, as well as consumer data\n•\nproviding loyalty rewards and benefits\nConsumer Debit. \n We support a range of payment products and solutions that allow our customers to provide consumers with convenient access to funds in deposit and other accounts.  Our debit and deposit access programs can be used to make purchases and to obtain cash from bank branches, at ATMs and, in some cases, at the point of sale.  Our branded debit programs consist of Mastercard (including standard, premium and affluent offerings), Maestro (our PIN-based solution that operates globally) and Cirrus (our primary global cash access solution).\nPrepaid. \n Prepaid accounts are a type of electronic payment that enables consumers to pay from pre-funded accounts whether or not they previously had a bank account or a credit history.  These accounts can be tailored to meet specific program, customer or consumer needs, such as paying bills, sending person-to-person payments or withdrawing cash from an ATM.  Our focus ranges from digital accounts (such as fintech and gig economy platforms) to business programs such as employee payroll, health savings accounts and solutions for small business owners.  Our prepaid programs also offer opportunities in the private and public sectors to drive financial inclusion of previously unbanked individuals through social security payments, unemployment benefits and salary cards.\nConsumer Bill Payments.  \nOur solutions enable consumers and small businesses to pay their billers in a seamless and secure way, providing an experience that offers flexibility and benefits consumers, financial institutions and billers.  Utilizing our merchant acceptance network (which includes many billers), we offer consumers the choice of paying their bills in a convenient and secure manner using credit, debit or prepaid as well as account-based payments methods.  \n \n12\n     MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nCommercial and New Payment Flows \nWe offer platforms, products and applications that apply our payments capabilities to capture commercial and new payment flows, enabling us to serve the needs of a significant addressable market.\nCommercial\nWe offer commercial credit, debit and prepaid payment products and solutions that meet the payment needs of large corporations, midsize companies, small businesses and government entities at the point of sale.  Our point-of-sale solutions streamline procurement and payment processes, manage information and expenses (such as travel and entertainment) and reduce administrative costs.  Our point-of-sale offerings include: \n•\nSmall business cards (credit, debit and prepaid) tailored to small and medium businesses\n•\nCommercial travel and entertainment, procurement and fleet cards, consisting mostly of credit cards and associated platforms for corporations to manage travel and expense, procurement and fleet expenses.  Our Mastercard Smart Data™ platform provides expense management and reporting capabilities.\nWe also offer solutions that enable businesses or governments to make invoiced payments to businesses with whom they have a trusted relationship for goods and services.  As part of our solutions, we offer a platform to optimize supplier payment enablement campaigns for financial institutions.\nAcross both point-of-sale and invoiced payments, we offer a Virtual Card Number (VCN) solution, which is generated dynamically from a physical card and leverages the credit limit of the funding account.  Our VCN solution may include the use of Mastercard In Control™, our virtual card platform that allows buyers to pay suppliers using a one-time use card number that can be set with transaction level controls, providing unmatched configurability, flexibility and control over spending.\nKey 2024 Developments\nIn 2024, we continued to drive VCN adoption by: \n•\nIntegrating for corporate payers our VCN solution into several third-party technology platforms to help streamline and automate card-based payment processes.  \n•\nOffering suppliers Mastercard Receivables Manager, a platform that helps automate the process of receiving payment by virtual card and can enable the provision of enhanced data to support reconciliation. \n•\nProviding companies of all sizes the ability to include a virtual card in a digital wallet, enabling a consumer-like experience for business payments and providing robust spend controls.\nDisbursements and Remittances\nThrough our Mastercard Move platform, we enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money domestically and across borders to consumers with greater speed and ease, with a payout reach of more than 10 billion endpoints globally across multiple channels, and in more than 60 originating countries and 155 receiving countries: \n \n•\nWe partner with digital messaging and payment platforms to enable consumers to send money directly within applications to other consumers.  \n•\nWe partner with central banks, fintechs and financial institutions to help governments and nonprofits more efficiently enable, as applicable, distribution of social and economic assistance and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) disbursements across various use cases (such as wallet funding, cash payouts, gig worker payouts and insurance claims).\n•\nWe enable a wide range of cross-border payment flows and use cases to customers (including trade payments, remittances and disbursements).  These flows are enabled via a distribution network with a single point of access that allows financial institutions, fintechs and digital partners to send and receive money globally through multiple channels, including bank accounts, mobile wallets, cards and cash payouts.\nKey 2024 Developments\n•\nIn 2024, we launched our Alias-Based Remittances and Payouts platform, which is designed to remove the friction of manually capturing required information to complete cross-border remittances and disbursements.  The solution simplifies the experience for both senders and receivers by using a beneficiary’s existing alias (such as their phone number or email) instead of requiring senders to ask for personal information or manually entering such information into numerous fields in order to make cross-border payments.\n \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K     \n13\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nBenefiting and Innovating the Payments Ecosystem\nWe provide functionality and technology to help our customers provide benefits and experiences for consumers, merchants, businesses and others.  \n•\nDelivering digital functionality and consumer experiences.\n \nWe use our technologies and security protocols to develop solutions to make digital shopping and selling experiences, such as on smartphones and other connected devices (both online and in person), simpler, faster and safer for consumers, businesses and merchants.  We also offer products that make it easier for merchants to accept payments and expand their customer base.\n◦\nOur contactless payment solutions help deliver a simple and intuitive way to pay.  Solutions such as SmartPOS and SoftPOS reduce the barrier to entry for merchants (including small businesses).  Our Tap on Phone acceptance technology enables businesses of all sizes to accept payments from any contactless card or mobile wallet directly from their device, providing a turnkey and cost-effective solution without any additional hardware required.  We extend our contactless payment solutions to a wide set of commerce use-cases, including instant provisioning of a card into a mobile wallet, verification of a transaction and sending money to family and friends or between businesses.\nKey 2024 Developments\nIn 2024, we reached significant milestones with our contactless, Click to Pay and tokenization efforts: \n•\nContactless payments now represent approximately 70% of all in-person purchase transactions on Mastercard-branded cards\n•\nClick to Pay transactions almost doubled year-over-year\n•\nApproximately 30% of all Mastercard transactions are now tokenized\n•\nOur Mastercard Digital First™ program enables our issuing customers to offer their cardholders a fully digital payment experience with an optional physical card, meeting cardholder expectations of immediacy, safety and convenience during card application, authentication and instant card access, securing purchases (whether contactless, in-store, in-app or online) and managing alerts, controls and benefits.\n◦\nOur Click to Pay checkout experience is designed to provide consumers convenience and security in a digital environment, make it easier for merchants to implement secure digital payments and provide issuers with improved fraud detection and prevention capabilities.  This experience enables a faster, more secure checkout experience across internet and mobile sites, mobile apps and connected devices.  \n•\nEnhancing security and effectiveness of transactions.\n \n We focus on securing transactions by replacing card numbers with secure tokens, scaling Mastercard Authentication (including enabling device-based biometrics, such as fingerprints or facial scans, through Mastercard Payment Passkey Service) and streamlining online checkout by eliminating manual entry (through Click to Pay and Secure Card on File).  We aim to improve the effectiveness of those transactions by increasing the number of transactions we switch through our differentiated services, increasing approval rates by utilizing inputs from our network and lifting spend and activation rates through personalized campaigns and data-driven strategies.\n•\nCreating solutions to unlock new blockchain-based business models.\n  Through a principled approach (including applying prudent risk management practices and maintaining continuous monitoring of our partners that are active in the digital asset market), we are focused on supporting blockchain ecosystems and digital currencies.  We integrate with financial institutions using the Mastercard Multi-Token Network™ to enable programmable payments, which helps make transactions within blockchain ecosystems more secure, scalable and interoperable.  We work with a wide range of crypto players to enable consumers to buy cryptocurrencies on card and spend those balances anywhere our brands are accepted.   \n•\nSimplifying access to, and integration of, our digital assets. \n Our Mastercard Developer platform makes it easy for customers and partners to leverage our many digital assets and services.  By providing a single access point with tools and capabilities to find APIs across a broad range of Mastercard services, we enable easy integration of our services into new and existing solutions.\n•\nIdentifying and experimenting with future technologies, start-ups and trends.\n \n Through Mastercard Foundry, we continue to provide customers and partners access to thought leadership, innovation methodologies, new technologies and relevant early-stage fintech players.\n \n14\n     MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1.

These products and services are designed to make commerce smarter, safer and more personal.  These data assets include data from an increasing variety of sources, such as transaction data (including from gateway, card, real-time payments and open banking), digital identities, buyer/supplier payment preferences, device attributes, digital threat assessments and rewards redemptions.  We continually invest in data cleansing, structuring and modeling as well as robust governance to make this data available for use in AI to be deployed at scale.  We utilize our data using traditional analytical methodologies and an ever-increasing range of AI, including machine learning, natural-language processing, neural networks and generative AI.  We aim to help power economies and empower people through AI-driven initiatives that enhance security, data analysis, personalization and efficiency.  \nWe do all this while following our Data and Tech Responsibility Principles in how we design, implement and deliver those solutions.  Our Privacy by Design, Data by Design and AI Governance processes are designed to ensure we embed multiple layers of privacy, data protection and information security controls in all our products and services, keeping a clear focus on protecting customers’ and individuals’ data.  We seek to do this in a number of ways: \n•\nImplementing accountability.  \nWe practice robust data and AI governance aimed at ensuring that we have the right controls and oversight over the use of our data and technology\n•\nPracticing data minimization.\n  We practice collecting and retaining only the personal information that is needed for a given product or service, and limiting the amount and type of personal information shared with third parties\n \n18\n     MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1.

We classify our net revenues, which include the impact of rebates and incentives, from contracts with customers into two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added services and solutions. \nWithin our payment network, revenue is primarily generated from charging fees to our customers based on GDV (which includes both domestic and cross-border volume) on the cards that carry our brands and for providing switching and other network-related services.  \nWithin our value-added services and solutions, we generate revenue primarily related to the following: \n•\nSecurity solutions\n•\nConsumer acquisition and engagement services\n•\nBusiness and market insights\n•\nDigital and authentication solutions\n•\nProcessing and gateway\n•\nOther solutions (including ACH batch and real-time account-based domestic and cross-border payments and solutions, as well as open banking)\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Revenue” in Part II, Item 7 and Note 3, Revenue for more detail about our revenue.\n \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K     \n19\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nIntellectual Property\nWe own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business, including Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus, through one or more affiliates.  We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and services offered by us to support our payment programs.  Trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used and/or properly maintained.  Through license agreements with our customers, we authorize the use of our trademarks on a royalty-free basis in connection with our customers’ issuing and merchant acquiring businesses.  In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, smart cards, contactless, mobile, biometrics, AI, security systems, blockchain and other technologies, which are important to our business operations.  These patents expire at varying times depending on the jurisdiction and filing date.\nCompetition\nWe face a number of competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry.  We compete in all categories of payments (including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments) as well as in all categories in which we provide services and solutions:\n•\nGeneral Purpose Payments Networks.\n  We compete worldwide with payments networks such as Visa, American Express, JCB, China UnionPay and Discover, among others.  These competitors tend to offer a range of card-based payment products.  Some competitors have more market share than we do in certain jurisdictions.  Some also have different business models that may provide an advantage in pricing, regulatory compliance burdens or otherwise.  Globally, financial institutions may issue both Mastercard- and Visa-branded payment products, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual portfolios or programs.  In addition, a number of our customers issue American Express-, China UnionPay- and/or Discover-branded payment cards in a manner consistent with a four-party system.  We continue to face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our issuers and acquirers, and we seek to enter into business agreements with them through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our payment products. \n•\nDebit and Local Networks.\n  We compete with ATM and point-of-sale debit networks.  In various countries, local debit brands serve as the main domestic brands, while our brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions (typically representing a small portion of overall transaction volume).  In addition, several governments are promoting, or considering promoting, local networks for domestic switching.  See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for a more detailed discussion of the risks related to payments system regulation and government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively.\n•\nReal-time Account-based Payments Systems.  \nWe face competition in the ACH and real-time account-based payments space from providers of infrastructure, applications and services.  As these real-time account-based propositions mature, we face a possible increase in competition for our existing domestic person-to-merchant (“P2M”) and person-to-person (“P2P”) transaction market share.  Similarly, as interlinking of these infrastructures is further explored, they could disrupt our existing cross-border P2M and P2P market share.  Also, several industry initiatives are experimenting with the concept of account-based global schemes, which could lead to a disruption of the clearing and settlement options utilized in various currencies.\n•\nDigital Wallets and other Fintechs.  \nAs the global payments industry becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from fintechs and other emerging payments providers, both for customers and data.  Many of these providers have developed payments systems focused on online activity in e-commerce and mobile channels (in some cases, expanding to other channels), and may process payments using in-house account transfers, real-time account-based payments networks or global or local networks, in addition to card.  Examples include digital wallet providers, point-of-sale financing/buy-now-pay-later providers, mobile operator services, mobile phone-based money transfer and microfinancing services, device manufacturers, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable providers.  \n•\nDigital Public Infrastructure and Other Government-Backed Solutions.\n  Governments have been focused on creating and expanding local digital payments structures.  Increasingly, these structures include digital public infrastructure (DPI), which is owned by governments and often supported by third parties, and aim to provide payments services as a public good.  Government- and central bank-backed structures (such as the Brazilian Instant Payment System-PIX, FedNow in the U.S. and United Payments Interface (UPI) in India), are increasingly being considered as alternatives to traditional domestic payment solutions and schemes such as ours.  In addition to local and regional networks, national governments continue to explore the use of central bank digital currencies (“CBDCs”), which may be launched with their own networks to transfer money between participants.\n•\nDigital Currencies.\n  Stablecoins and floating cryptocurrencies may become more popular as they become more regulated and increasingly viewed as providing immediacy, 24/7 accessibility, immutability and efficiency.  Some players, including payment \n \n20\n     MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nservice providers and payment facilitators, have started to enable merchant acceptance of such currencies in P2M, while some banks have started experimenting with blockchain B2B payments.  Digital currencies and emerging players (such as crypto natives) have the ability to disrupt traditional financial markets.  The increased prominence of digital currencies creates an opportunity for us, but could equally compete with our products and services.\n \n•\nServices and Solutions Providers.\n  We face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our services and solutions.  These companies include information services and consulting firms that provide consulting services and insights to financial institutions, merchants and governments, technology companies that provide cyber and fraud solutions (including AI-based solutions), and companies that compete against us as providers of loyalty and program management solutions.  We also face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our other solutions, including open banking.  Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in this space.\nWe play a valuable role as a trusted intermediary in a complex system, creating value for individual stakeholders and the payments ecosystem overall.  Our competitive advantages include:\nGlobal network\nHighly adaptable and world class global payments network that can reach a variety of parties to enable payments anywhere\nFranchise model\nEstablishing rules, standards and bearing of financial risk (including our settlement guarantee backed by our strong credit standing) that allows for interoperability among all participants\nMulti-rail\nMultiple payments capabilities based on our innovation and technology that enable choice\nBrand\nGlobally recognized and trusted brands\nData and AI\nProducts and services utilizing our data and AI assets, technology, platforms and expertise that incorporate our Data and Tech Responsibility Principles and reflect our Privacy by Design, Data by Design and AI Governance processes\nTalent and culture\nWorld class talent and culture guided by the Mastercard Way, with a focus on providing equal opportunities for all of our employees and “doing well by doing good”\nTechnology\nLeading-edge technology that advances the quality, speed and diversity of our offerings and solutions\nGovernment engagement\nAbility to serve a broad array of participants in global payments due to our expanded on-soil presence in individual markets and a heightened focus on working with governments\nCollectively, the capabilities that we have created organically, and those that we have obtained through acquisitions, support and build upon each other to enhance the total proposition we offer our customers.  They enable us to partner with many participants in the broader payments ecosystem and provide choice, security and services to improve the value we provide to our customers.  \n \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K     \n21\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a technology company in the global payments industry, we are subject to government regulation that impacts key aspects of our business.  In particular, we are subject to the laws and regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our products and services are used.  We are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations and implementing policies, procedures and programs designed to promote compliance.  We monitor and coordinate globally while acting locally and establish relationships to assess and manage the effects of regulation on us.  See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for more detail and examples of the regulation to which we are subject. \nPayments Oversight and Regulation.\n  Central banks and other regulators around the world either have established, or are seeking to establish, formal oversight over participants in the payments industry, as well as authority to regulate payments systems in their countries.  Such authority has resulted in certain of these entities regulating Mastercard as financial market infrastructure, as well as establishing oversight related to various aspects of our business (including areas such as consumer protections and cybersecurity).  In the European Union (the “EU”), Mastercard is subject to systemic importance regulation, which includes various requirements we must meet, including obligations related to governance and risk management.  In the U.K., the Bank of England designated Vocalink™, our real-time account-based payments network platform, as a “specified service provider”, and Mastercard as a “recognized payment system”, which includes supervisions and examination requirements.  In addition, EU legislation requires us to separate our scheme activities (brand, products, franchise and licensing) from our switching activities and other processing in terms of how we go to market, make decisions and organize our structure.  Examples of other markets where Mastercard is formally overseen include Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa and Canada.  Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are also regulated as payments institutions and payment service providers, including as money transmitters.  This regulation subjects us to licensing obligations, regulatory supervision and examinations, as well as various business conduct and risk management requirements.\nInterchange Fees.\n  Interchange fees that support the function and value of four-party payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged around the world via legislation to regulate interchange fees, competition-related regulatory proceedings, central bank regulation and litigation.  Examples include statutes in the U.S. that cap debit interchange for certain regulated activities, proposed legislation in the U.S. to extend routing mandates to credit, our settlement with the European Commission (the “EC”) resolving its investigation into our interregional interchange fees and the EU legislation capping consumer credit and debit interchange fees on payments issued and acquired within the European Economic Area  (the “EEA”).  For more detail, see “Risk Factors - Other Regulation” in Part I, Item 1A and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nKey 2024 Developments\n•\nIn May 2024, the state of Illinois passed the Interchange Fee Prohibition Act, which prohibits the assessment of interchange on the tax and gratuity portion of an electronic payment transaction.  This law is subject to litigation regarding its validity.\n•\nLegislation was introduced in the 117th U.S. Congress (2023-2024) that would extend routing mandates for Mastercard and Visa to credit.  The bill, which is no longer active but could be reintroduced in the new Congress, stipulated that the top two networks could not be enabled on the same card, leaving room for regional networks to serve as second options.  The bill proposed to mandate Mastercard provide authentication, tokenization or other security technology to competing networks, whether or not the transaction is switched by Mastercard.\n•\nIn October 2024, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) finalized a rule requiring data providers to make covered data available to consumers and authorized third parties, promoting industry standard-setting bodies recognized by the CFPB, and outlining obligations for third parties accessing data on behalf of consumers (including limitations on the collection, use and retention of covered data).  The rule provides for phased-in compliance deadlines, which start in April 2026 and are tiered based on institution size. \n•\nIn November 2024, in compliance with newly effective registration requirements under the Retail Payment Activities Act in Canada, Mastercard registered its entities that provide certain defined payment functions with the Bank of Canada.  These entities are required to implement operational risk, safeguarding of funds, and reporting frameworks under the Act by September 2025. \n \n22\n     MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nPreferential or Protective Government Actions. \n Some governments have taken action to provide resources, preferential treatment or other protection to selected domestic payments and processing providers, as well as to create their own national providers.  For example, governments in some countries mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies.  Some jurisdictions are currently considering adopting or have adopted data localization requirements, which mandate the collection, storage, and/or other processing of data within their borders.  This is the case, for instance, in India, China and Saudi Arabia.  Various forms of data localization requirements or data transfer restrictions are also under consideration in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU. \nAnti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption. \n We are subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) and countering the financing of terrorism (“CFT”) laws and regulations globally, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as the various economic sanctions programs, including those imposed and administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the European Union.  We have implemented a comprehensive AML/CFT program, comprised of policies, procedures and internal controls, including the designation of a compliance officer, which is designed to prevent our payments network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity and to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.  The economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies (specifically Crimea, the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria) and with persons and entities included in OFAC sanctions lists including its list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the “SDN List”).  We take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with OFAC and other applicable sanctions, including establishing a risk-based compliance program that has policies, procedures and controls designed to prevent us from having unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or entities.  As part of this program, we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply with their local sanctions obligations and U.S. and EU sanctions programs.  In the U.S., these obligations include requiring the screening of account holders and merchants against OFAC sanctions lists (including the SDN List).  Iran and Syria have been identified by the U.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated entities located in these countries and do not license entities domiciled there.  We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations globally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which, among other things, generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage.  We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls to proactively manage corruption risk.\nIssuer and Acquirer Practices Legislation and Regulation. \n Our issuers and acquirers are subject to numerous regulations and investigations applicable to banks, financial institutions and other licensed entities, which can indirectly impact us.  Additionally, regulations such as the EU’s Payment Services Directive in the EEA require financial institutions to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, enabling them to route transactions away from Mastercard products and provide payment initiation and account information services directly to consumers who use our products.  Authorities in the EU are also revising standards relating to the authentication of transactions, which may increase the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.\nRegulation of Internet and High-Risk Merchant Categories.\n  Various jurisdictions have enacted regulation related to internet transactions (such as laws surrounding gambling, including fantasy sports), which impacts both us and our customers.  We are also impacted by evolving laws surrounding certain legally permissible but high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco.  \nPrivacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security. \n Aspects of our operations or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data, AI and information security laws and regulations in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world.  For example, in the U.S., we and our customers are respectively subject to, among other laws and regulations, Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) that require, among other things, the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program and, increasingly, a number of state data and privacy laws.  We and our customers may also be subject to evolving U.S. federal and/or state AI laws and regulations.  With respect to information security, we are subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) disclosure rules that require, among other things, disclosing material cybersecurity incidents in a Current Report on Form 8-K, generally within four business days of determining an incident is material.  In the EU, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protection and information security program to protect the personal and sensitive data of EEA residents.  Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use the GDPR as a reference to adopt new or updated privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations, although divergences have occurred.  Laws and regulations in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collection and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensitive data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI (which is now subject to regulation in the EU as well as other places).  In \n \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K     \n23\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\naddition, the interpretation and application of these privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations are often uncertain and in a state of flux, thus requiring constant monitoring for compliance.\nSustainability Disclosures.\n \nVarious jurisdictions have adopted or are increasingly considering adopting laws, regulations and oversight expectations requiring disclosure on environmental, social and governance matters.  Regulations already adopted or being considered include required corporate reporting and disclosures on topics with respect to climate, such as the U.K. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting, the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“EU CSRD”), and, to the extent they become effective, SEC rules related to climate change.  Other adopted or potential regulations focus on social topics, including human rights, such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, the treatment of employees and diversity of workforce, such as in the EU CSRD.\nAdditional Regulatory Developments.  \nVarious regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could impact us, including evolving laws and guidance surrounding buy-now-pay-later, open banking, credit reporting, digital currencies, marijuana, prepaid payroll cards, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, marketing and operational resilience.\nAdditional Information\nMastercard Incorporated was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in May 2001.

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of Mastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated (together, “Mastercard” or the “Company”), included elsewhere in this Report.  Percentage changes provided throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.  For discussion related to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, please see Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.  \nBusiness Overview \nMastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry.  We connect consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions secure, simple, smart and accessible.  We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®.  We operate a payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and our customers.  Through our unique and proprietary global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions.  We have additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments).  Using these capabilities, we offer consumer and commercial payment products, capture new payment flows and provide services and solutions.  These services and solutions include, among others, security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement services, and business and market insights, all of which draw on our principled and responsible use of secure data.  Our capabilities strengthen, reinforce and complement each other and are fundamentally interdependent.  For our global payments network, our franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them.  We employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which we operate.\nMastercard is not a financial institution.  We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers (the account holders’ financial institutions), or establish the rates charged by acquirers (the merchants’ financial institutions) in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our products.  In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.\nFinancial Results Overview\nThe following table provides a summary of our key GAAP operating results, as reported: \nYears ended December 31,\n2024\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n2023\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions, except percentages and per share data)\nNet revenue\n$\n28,167 \n$\n25,098 \n$\n22,237 \n12%\n13%\nOperating expenses\n$\n12,585 \n$\n11,090 \n$\n9,973 \n13%\n11%\nOperating income\n$\n15,582 \n$\n14,008 \n$\n12,264 \n11%\n14%\nOperating margin\n55.3 \n%\n55.8 \n%\n55.2 \n%\n(0.5) ppt\n0.7 ppt\nIncome tax expense\n$\n2,380 \n$\n2,444 \n$\n1,802 \n(3)%\n36%\nEffective income tax rate\n15.6 \n%\n17.9 \n%\n15.4 \n%\n(2.3) ppt\n2.6 ppt\nNet income\n$\n12,874 \n$\n11,195 \n$\n9,930 \n15%\n13%\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n13.89 \n$\n11.83 \n$\n10.22 \n17%\n16%\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding\n927 \n946 \n971 \n(2)%\n(3)%\nNote: Table may not sum due to rounding.\n \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K     \n46\nPART II\nITEM 7.

Additionally, a change in our geographic mix of earnings in 2024 contributed to the lower effective income tax rate compared to the prior year.\n15.6%\n16.2%\ndown 2.3 ppt\ndown 2.3 ppt\nOther 2024 financial highlights were as follows:\n•\nWe generated net cash flows from operations of $14.8 billion.\n•\nWe completed the acquisitions of businesses for total consideration of $2.8 billion.\n•\nWe repurchased 23.0 million shares of our common stock for $11.0 billion and paid dividends of $2.4 billion.\n•\nWe completed debt offerings for an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion.\n \n47\n     MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Financial Information \nNon-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).  As described more fully below, our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition, as well as the related tax impacts.  Our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts (“Special Items”).  We also present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.  We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.  We excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items.  Net revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense), effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, Special Items and/or the impact of currency should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.  \nOur non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:\nGains and Losses on Equity Investments\n•\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net pre-tax losses of $29 million ($25 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted share), $61 million ($36 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) and $145 million ($126 million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share), respectively.  These net losses were primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities.\nSpecial Items\nLitigation provisions \n•\nDuring 2024, we recorded pre-tax charges of $680 million ($495 million after tax, or $0.53 per diluted share), primarily as a result of a legal provision associated with the U.K. consumer class action settlement, settlements with a number of U.K. merchants and a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation. \n•\nDuring 2023, we recorded pre-tax charges of $539 million ($376 million after tax, or $0.40 per diluted share), primarily as a result of changes in the estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation and settlements with a number of U.K. and Pan-European merchants.\n•\nDuring 2022, we recorded pre-tax charges of $356 million ($263 million after tax, or $0.27 per diluted share), primarily as a result of settlements (both final and agreements in principle) with a number of U.K. merchants and a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.\nRestructuring charge\n \n•\nDuring 2024, we recorded a restructuring charge of $190 million ($147 million after tax, or $0.16 per diluted share).  The restructuring action is intended to streamline our organization, delivering efficiencies to enable reinvestment in our business to support the realization of our long-term growth opportunities.\nRussia-related impacts\n•\nDuring 2022, we recorded a net pre-tax charge of $30 million ($24 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share), directly related to imposed sanctions and the suspension of our business operations in Russia.  The net charge was comprised of general and administrative expenses of $67 million, primarily related to incremental employee-related costs and reserves on uncollectible balances with certain sanctioned customers.  This charge was offset by net benefits of $37 million in net revenue, primarily related to a reduction in payment network rebates and incentives liabilities as a result of lower estimates of customer performance for certain customer business agreements due to the suspension of our business operations in Russia. \nSee Note 7 (Investments) and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion related to certain of the items discussed above.  \n \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K     \n48\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCurrency-neutral Growth Rates\nCurrency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results and are non-GAAP financial measures.  The impact of currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different from our U.S. dollar reporting currency.  The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.  The impact of the related realized gains and losses resulting from our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments (specifically those that manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses) is recognized in the respective financial statement line item on the statements of operations when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings.\nThe translational and transactional impact of currency and the related impact of our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments as specified in the preceding paragraph (collectively the “Currency Impact”) has been excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates and has been identified in the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” tables below and our “Drivers of Change” tables.  See “Foreign Currency - Currency Impact” for further information on our currency impacts and “Financial Results - Net Revenue” and “Financial Results - Operating Expenses” for our “Drivers of Change” tables.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nThe following tables reconcile our reported financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to the respective adjusted non-GAAP financial measures:\nYear ended December 31, 2024\nNet revenue\n Operating \nexpenses\nOperating\n \nmargin\nOther\nincome\n \n(expense)\nEffective\n \nincome\n \ntax rate\n Net \nincome\n Diluted \nearnings \nper share\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nReported - GAAP\n$\n28,167 \n$\n12,585 \n55.3 \n%\n$\n(328)\n15.6 \n%\n$\n12,874 \n$\n13.89 \n(Gains) losses on equity investments\n ** \n**\n**\n29 \n— \n%\n25 \n0.03 \nLitigation provisions\n ** \n(680)\n2.4 \n%\n**\n0.5 \n%\n495 \n0.53 \nRestructuring charge\n**\n(190)\n0.7 \n%\n ** \n0.1 \n%\n147 \n0.16 \nAdjusted - Non-GAAP\n$\n28,167 \n$\n11,714 \n58.4 \n%\n$\n(300)\n16.2 \n%\n$\n13,541 \n$\n14.60 \nYear ended December 31, 2023\nNet revenue\n Operating \nexpenses\nOperating \nmargin\nOther\nincome\n \n(expense)\nEffective \nincome \ntax rate\n Net \nincome\n Diluted \nearnings \nper share\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nReported - GAAP\n$\n25,098 \n$\n11,090 \n55.8 \n%\n$\n(369)\n17.9 \n%\n$\n11,195 \n$\n11.83 \n(Gains) losses on equity investments\n**\n**\n**\n61 \n0.1 \n%\n36 \n0.04 \nLitigation provisions\n**\n(539)\n2.1 \n%\n**\n0.5 \n%\n376 \n0.40 \nAdjusted - Non-GAAP\n$\n25,098 \n$\n10,551 \n58.0 \n%\n$\n(308)\n18.5 \n%\n$\n11,607 \n$\n12.26 \nYear ended December 31, 2022\nNet revenue\n Operating \nexpenses\nOperating \nmargin\nOther\nincome\n \n(expense)\nEffective \nincome \ntax rate\n Net \nincome\n Diluted \nearnings \nper share\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nReported - GAAP\n$\n22,237 \n$\n9,973 \n55.2 \n%\n$\n(532)\n15.4 \n%\n$\n9,930 \n10.22 \n(Gains) losses on equity investments\n**\n**\n**\n145 \n— \n%\n126 \n0.13 \nLitigation provisions\n**\n(356)\n1.6 \n%\n**\n0.3 \n%\n263 \n0.27 \nRussia-related impacts\n(37)\n(67)\n0.2 \n%\n**\n— \n%\n24 \n0.02 \nAdjusted - Non-GAAP\n$\n22,200 \n$\n9,549 \n57.0 \n%\n$\n(387)\n15.7 \n%\n$\n10,342 \n$\n10.65 \nNote: Tables may not sum due to rounding.\n** Not applicable.\n \n49\n     MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7.

We believe that the key metrics presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.  \nOperating Margin\n measures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales after our operating costs but before other income (expense) and income tax expense.  Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\nKey Drivers \nGross Dollar Volume (“GDV”)\n1\n measures dollar volume of activity, including both domestic and cross-border volume, on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis.  GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period.  Information denominated in U.S. dollars relating to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported.  These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.  We report period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.\nCross-border Volume Growth\n measures the growth of cross-border dollar volume during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs. \n \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K     \n50\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSwitched Transactions\n measures the number of transactions switched by Mastercard, which is defined as the number of transactions initiated and switched through our network during the period.\n1    \nData used in the calculation of GDV is provided by Mastercard customers and is subject to verification by Mastercard and partial cross-checking against information provided by Mastercard’s transaction switching systems.  All data is subject to revision and amendment by Mastercard or Mastercard’s customers.\nThe following tables provide a summary of the growth trends in our key drivers.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nUSD\nLocal\nUSD\nLocal\nMastercard-branded GDV growth \n1\n8%\n11%\n11%\n12%\nUnited States\n7%\n7%\n6%\n6%\nWorldwide less United States\n9%\n12%\n13%\n15%\nCross-border volume growth \n1\n17%\n18%\n25%\n24%\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nSwitched transactions growth\n11%\n14%\n1    \nExcludes volume generated by Maestro and Cirrus cards.\nKey Metrics related to the Payment Network\nAssessments represent agreed upon standard pricing provided to our customers based on various forms of payment-related activity.  Assessments are used internally by management to monitor operating performance as it allows for comparability and provides visibility into cardholder trends.  Assessments do not represent our net revenue.\nThe following provides additional information on our key metrics related to the payment network:\n•\nDomestic assessments \nare charges based on activity related to cards that carry the Company’s brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same.  These assessments are primarily driven by the domestic dollar volume of activity (e.g., domestic purchase volume, domestic cash volume) or the number of cards issued.\n•\nCross-border assessments \nare charges based on activity related to cards that carry the Company’s brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are different.  These assessments are primarily driven by the cross-border dollar volume of activity (e.g., cross-border purchase volume, cross-border cash volume). \n•\nTransaction processing assessments\n are charges primarily driven by the number of switched transactions on our payment network.  Switching activities include:\n◦\nAuthorization, the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval \n◦\nClearing, the determination and exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction \n◦\nSettlement, which facilitates the determination and exchange of funds between parties\n \nThese assessments can also include connectivity services and network access, which are based on the volume of data transmitted and the number of authorization and settlement messages.\n•\nOther network assessments \nare charges for licensing, implementation and other franchise fees.\n \n51\n     MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7.

Our overall operating results are impacted by currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency.  \nOur operating results are also impacted by transactional currency.  The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.  Changes in currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“GDV”), which is used in the calculation of our key metrics related to domestic assessments and cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and incentives.  GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars and euros using average exchange rates for the period.  As a result, our key metrics related to domestic assessments and cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar and euro versus local currencies.  For example, our billing in Australia is in the U.S. dollar, however, consumer spend in Australia is in the Australian dollar.  The transactional currency impact of converting Australian dollars to our U.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated.  The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV growth on a local currency basis.  In 2024, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 8.1%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 10.5% versus 2023.  In 2023, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 10.6%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 12.2% versus 2022.  Further, the impact from transactional currency occurs in our key metrics related to transaction processing assessments and other network assessments as well as value-added services and solutions revenue and operating expenses when the transacting currency of these items is different than the functional currency of the entity.\nTo manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts and designate such derivatives as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship as discussed further in Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nForeign Exchange Activity\nWe incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities, including settlement assets and obligations, that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.  To manage this foreign exchange risk, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of our nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities.  The gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value of these contracts are intended to reduce the potential effect of the underlying hedged exposure and are recorded net within general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.  The impact of this foreign exchange activity, including with the related hedging activities, has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results.\nOur foreign exchange risk management activities are discussed further in Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. \n \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K     \n52\nPART II\nITEM 7.

The increase in net revenue was attributable to growth in our payment network and value-added services and solutions. \nNet revenue from our payment network increased 10%, or 11% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2024 versus the prior year.  The increase was primarily driven by growth in domestic and cross-border dollar volumes and an increase in the number of switched transactions, reflecting growth trends across all of our key drivers.  Net revenue from our payment network includes $17,629 million of rebates and incentives provided to customers, which increased 16%, or 18% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2024 versus the prior year, primarily due to an increase in our key drivers as well as new and renewed deals.\nNet revenue from our value-added services and solutions increased 17%, on both an as-reported and currency-neutral basis, in 2024 versus the prior year.  The increase was driven primarily by (1) growth in our underlying key drivers, (2) our consumer acquisition and engagement and business and market insight services, (3) our security and digital and authentication solutions and (4) pricing.\nSee Note 3 (Revenue) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for a further discussion of how we recognize revenue.\nDrivers of Change\nThe following table summarizes the drivers of change in net revenue:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nOperational\nAcquisitions\nCurrency \nImpact \n1, 2\nSpecial Items \n2\nTotal\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nPayment network\n11%\n11%\n**\n—%\n(1)%\n—%\n**\n— \n%\n10 \n%\n10 \n%\nValue-added services and solutions\n17%\n16%\n—%\n—%\n(1)%\n1%\n**\n**\n17 \n%\n18 \n%\nNet revenue\n13%\n13%\n—%\n—%\n(1)%\n—%\n**\n— \n%\n12 \n%\n13 \n%\nNote: Table may not sum due to rounding.\n**  Not applicable.\n1    \nIncludes the translational and transactional impact of currency and the related impact of our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments.\n2    \nSee “Non-GAAP Financial Information” for further information on our non-GAAP adjustments and the reconciliation to GAAP reported amounts.\nNo individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of net revenue in any such period.

In 2023, we recorded charges of $539 million, primarily as a result of changes in the estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation and settlements with a number of U.K. and Pan-European merchants.  In 2022, we recorded charges of $356 million, primarily as a result of settlements (both final and agreements in principle) with a number of U.K. merchants and a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIncome Taxes \nThe effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 15.6% and 17.9%, respectively.  The adjusted effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 16.2% and 18.5%, respectively.  Both the as-reported and as-adjusted effective income tax rates were lower in 2024, primarily due to a discrete tax expense in 2023 related to changes in the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. foreign tax credits deferred tax asset.  In 2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the U.S. tax regulations published in 2022 changed due to the foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and Notice 2023-55 (the “Notice”) released by the U.S. Department of Treasury.  Therefore, we recognized a total $327 million discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish the valuation allowance.  This discrete tax expense was partially offset by our ability to claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 due to the Notice.  Additionally, a change in our geographic mix of earnings in 2024 contributed to the lower effective income tax rates compared to the prior year. \nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) Pillar 2 guidelines published to date include transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the 15% global minimum tax (the “Pillar 2 Rules”).  In 2024, we did not experience a material impact as a result of Pillar 2 Rules.  However, in 2025, we expect the Pillar 2 Rules will primarily offset the reduction to our effective income tax rate resulting from our incentive grant received from the Singapore Ministry of Finance.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, this incentive grant reduced our effective income tax rate by approximately 4%.  We are continuously monitoring developments and evaluating the impacts these new rules may have on our future effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. \nSee Note 20 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations.  The following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit available to us at December 31:\n2024\n2023\n(in billions)\nCash, cash equivalents and investments \n1\n$\n8.8 \n$\n9.2 \nUnused line of credit\n$\n8.0 \n$\n8.0 \n1\nInvestments include available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities.  This amount excludes restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, our cash flow generating capabilities, and our access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations which include litigation provisions and credit and settlement exposure.\nOur liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions.  We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our customers.  Historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be indicative of potential future losses.  The risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven by regional or global economic and market conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region.  See Note 22 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for a description of these guarantees.\nOur liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.  For additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.\n \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K     \n56\nPART II\nITEM 7.

In July 2024, INR28.1 billion ($336 million as of payment date) of principal related to the 2023 INR Term Loan matured and was paid.\nDuring 2024, we issued a total of $4 billion of debt, as follows:\n•\nIn May 2024, we issued $1 billion principal amount of notes due May 2034\n•\nIn September 2024, we issued $750 million principal amount of notes due January 2028, $1,150 million principal amount of notes due January 2032 and $1,100 million principal amount of notes due January 2035\nThe issuances in 2024 are collectively referred to as the “2024 USD Notes”.  The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 USD Notes, after deducting the original issue discount, underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $3.96 billion.\nOur total debt outstanding was $18.2 billion at December 31, 2024, with the earliest maturity of $750 million of principal occurring in March 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”), under which we are authorized to issue up to $8 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance.  In conjunction with the Commercial Paper Program, we have a committed unsecured $8 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that expires in November 2029. \nBorrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to be used to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers.  In addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes.  We had no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program or the Credit Facility at December 31, 2024.\nSee Note 15 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion on our debt, the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility.\nDividends and Share Repurchases\nWe have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock.  Subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend.  The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.  \n \n57\n     MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table summarizes the annual total and per share dividends paid in the years reflected:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions, except per share data)\nCash dividend, per share\n$\n2.64 \n$\n2.28 \n$\n1.96 \nCash dividends paid\n$\n2,448 \n$\n2,158 \n$\n1,903 \nOn December 17, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.76 per share paid on February 7, 2025 to holders of record as of January 9, 2025 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.  The aggregate amount of this dividend was $694 million.\nOn February 10, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.76 per share payable on May 9, 2025 to holders of record as of April 9, 2025 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.  The aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be $693 million.\nRepurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock.  In December 2024 and 2023, our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs of our Class A common stock authorizing us to repurchase up to $12.0 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively.  The program approved in 2024 will become effective after the completion of the program approved in 2023.  The timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including cash requirements to meet the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, as well as the share price and economic and market conditions.  The following table summarizes our share repurchase authorizations and repurchase activity of our Class A common stock for the year ended December 31, 2024, unless otherwise noted:\n(in millions, except per share data)\nRemaining authorization at December 31, 2023\n$\n14,142 \nDollar-value of shares repurchased in 2024\n$\n10,954 \nRemaining authorization at December 31, 2024\n$\n15,188 \nShares repurchased in 2024\n23.0 \nAverage price paid per share in 2024\n$\n475.35 \nDollar-value of shares repurchased in 2025 (through February 7, 2025)\n$\n959 \nNote: Table may not sum due to rounding.\nSee Note 16 (Stockholders' Equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe application of GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition.  Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. \nRevenue Recognition - Rebates and Incentives\nWe enter into business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incentives when customers meet certain volume thresholds or other incentives tied to customer performance.  We consider various factors in estimating customer performance, including forecasted transactions, card issuance and card conversion volumes, expected payments and historical experience with that customer.  Rebates and incentives are recorded within net revenue based on these estimates primarily when volume- and transaction- based revenues are recognized over the contractual term.  Differences between actual results and our estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance.  If our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, net revenue may be materially different.\n \nMASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K     \n58\nPART II\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings.  We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure.  If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss.  Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable.  Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel.  Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time.  As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates.  Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes.  \nIncome Taxes\nIn calculating our effective income tax rate, estimates are required regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions.  Through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings.  Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  Significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance.  In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all sources of taxable income, including projected future taxable income, reversing taxable temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies.  If it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made, with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings.\nWe record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities.  We consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and, if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements.  If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would generally increase earnings in the period.  In certain situations, we will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions.  \nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting.  The acquisition purchase price, including contingent consideration, if any, is allocated to the underlying identified, tangible and intangible assets, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date.  Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill.  The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.  We use various valuation techniques to determine fair value, primarily discounted cash flows analysis, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings for estimating the value of intangible assets.  These valuation techniques include comparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions.  Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the expected useful lives, requires management’s judgment.  The significance of management’s estimates and assumptions is relative to the size of the acquisition.  Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. \n \n59\n     MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K\nPART II",
