We design, manufacture and market a broad range of products for the heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (“HVACR”) markets.  We have leveraged our expertise to become an industry leader known for innovation, quality and reliability.  Our products and services are sold through multiple distribution channels under various brand names.  The Company was founded in 1895, in Marshalltown, Iowa, by Dave Lennox, the owner of a machine repair business for railroads.  He designed and patented a riveted steel coal-fired furnace, which led to numerous advancements in heating, cooling and climate control solutions.  \nOur two business segments, Home Comfort Solutions and Building Climate Solutions, the key products, services and well-known product and brand names within each segment and net sales in 2024 by segment are shown in the table below. The Corporate and Other segment previously held our European operations, which were successfully divested in the fourth quarter of 2023. Corporate and Other was excluded from the table below as there were no sales in 2024. Segment financial data for 2024, 2023 and 2022, including financial information about foreign and domestic operations, is included in Note 3 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and is incorporated herein by reference.\nSegment\nProducts & Services\nProduct and Brand Names\n2024\nNet Sales (in millions)\nHome Comfort Solutions\nFurnaces, air conditioners, heat pumps, packaged heating and cooling systems, indoor air quality equipment, comfort control products, replacement parts and supplies\nLennox, Dave Lennox Signature Collection, Armstrong Air, Ducane, AirEase, Concord, MagicPak, ADP Advanced Distributor Products, Allied, Elite Series, Merit Series, Comfort Sync, Healthy Climate, Healthy Climate Solutions, iComfort, ComfortSense and Lennox Stores\n$\n3,577.1 \nBuilding Climate Solutions\nUnitary heating and air conditioning equipment, applied systems, controls, installation and service of commercial heating and cooling equipment, variable refrigerant flow commercial products, curb, curb adapters, drop box diffusers, HVAC recycling and salvage service,  condensing units, unit coolers, fluid coolers, air cooled condensers, air handlers, process chillers, controls, compressorized racks\nLennox, Model L, CORE, Enlight, Xion, Energence, Prodigy, Strategos, Raider, Lennox VRF, Lennox National Account Services, Allied Commercial, Elite, AES Industries, AES Mechanical, AES Recycle,  Heatcraft Worldwide Refrigeration, Bohn, MAGNA, Larkin, Climate Control, Chandler Refrigeration, IntelliGen and Interlink\n1,764.2 \nTotal\n$\n5,341.3 \n \nProducts and Services\nHome Comfort Solutions\nHeating & Cooling Products\n.  We manufacture and market a broad range of heat pumps, furnaces, air conditioners, packaged heating and cooling systems, equipment and accessories to improve indoor air quality, comfort control products, replacement parts and supplies and related products for both the residential replacement and new construction markets in North America. These products are available in a variety of designs and efficiency levels and at a range of price points, and are intended to provide a complete line of home comfort solutions. We believe that by maintaining a broad product line marketed under multiple brand names, we can address different market segments and penetrate multiple distribution channels. \n1\nThe “Lennox” business and brands (“Dave Lennox Signature Collection,” “Elite Series,” “Merit Series,” “iComfort,” “ComfortSense” and “Healthy Climate Solutions”) are sold directly to independent installing dealers, making us one of the largest wholesale distributors of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning products in North America.  We operate a network of Lennox Stores across the United States and Canada. These stores provide an easy access solution for contractors and independent dealers to obtain universal service and replacement parts, supplies, convenience items, tools, Lennox equipment and OEM parts.\nThe Allied Air Enterprise business and brands (“Armstrong Air,” “AirEase,” “Concord,” “Ducane,” “Allied,” and “MagicPak”) include a full line of heating, ventilation and air conditioning products and are sold through independent wholesale distributors in the U.S. and Canada.  The Allied Air Enterprise business also sells a full line of heating, ventilation and cooling equipment through private label brands.\n The Advanced Distributor Products (“ADP”) business and brand (“ADP Advanced Distributor Products”) sells evaporator coils, air handlers and unit heaters to independent HVAC wholesale distributors across the U.S. and Canada.  \nBuilding Climate Solutions \nHeating and Cooling Products. \nIn North America, we manufacture and sell unitary heating and cooling equipment used in light commercial applications, such as low-rise office buildings, restaurants, retail centers, distribution, churches and schools.\n \nOur product offerings for these applications include rooftop units ranging from 2 to 30 tons of cooling capacity and split system/air handler combinations, which range from 1.5 to 20 tons of cooling capacity.\n \nThese products are distributed primarily through commercial contractors and directly to national account customers. We believe the success of our products is attributable to their efficiency, impact to the environment, design flexibility, total cost of ownership, ease of service, and advanced control technology.\nNational Account Services\n.  National Account Service (“NAS”) provides installation, service and preventive maintenance for commercial HVAC national account customers in the United States and Canada.\n     AES\n. \nIn October 2023, we completed the acquisition of AES Industries, Inc. and AES Mechanical Service Group, Inc. (collectively, “AES”) to the Building Climate Solutions segment. AES is a company dedicated to service and sustainability in the light commercial markets across North America. AES manufactures curbs, curb adapters, drop box diffusers and also offers HVAC recycling and salvage services, as well as focusing on multi-facility HVAC replacement for expired mechanical assets.  \n     Refrigeration Products. \nWe manufacture and market equipment for the North American commercial refrigeration markets under the Heatcraft Worldwide Refrigeration name.  We sell these products to distributors, installing contractors, engineering design firms, original equipment manufacturers and end-users. \nOur commercial refrigeration products include condensing units, unit coolers, fluid coolers, air-cooled condensers, air handlers and refrigeration rack systems.  These products preserve food and other perishables in supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants, warehouses and distribution centers.  In addition, our products are used to cool a wide variety of industrial processes, including data centers, machine tooling, and other critical cooling applications. We routinely provide application engineering for consulting engineers, contractors, store planners, end customers and others to support the sale of commercial refrigeration products.  \nIn addition, we own a 50% interest in a joint venture in Mexico that produces unit coolers, air-cooled condensers, condensing units, compressors and compressorized racks of the same design and quality as those manufactured by our U.S. business.  This joint venture product line is complemented with imports from the U.S., which are sold through the joint venture’s distribution network. \nSamsung JV\n. \nWe own a 49.9% interest in a joint venture with Samsung that distributes Samsung ductless AC and heat pump products in the U.S. and Canada as well as \"Lennox powered by Samsung\" branded products through Lennox stores and direct-to-dealer network. Results are reported in either Home Comfort Solutions or Building Climate Solutions based on product type.\n   \nCorporate and Other\n \nPrior to 2024, our Corporate and Other segment included the results of our European operations. We manufactured and sold unitary HVAC products, which ranged from 2 to 70 tons of cooling capacity, and applied systems with up to 200 tons of cooling capacity.  Our European products consisted of small package units, rooftop units, chillers, air handlers and fan coils that served medium-rise commercial buildings, shopping malls, other retail and entertainment buildings, institutional applications \n2\nand other field-engineered applications.  We manufactured heating and cooling products in several locations in Europe and marketed these products through both direct and indirect distribution channels.  We also manufactured and marketed refrigeration products including condensing units, unit coolers, air-cooled condensers, fluid coolers, compressor racks and industrial process chillers. We had manufacturing locations in Germany, France and Spain. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we successfully completed the divestiture of our European operations. \nBusiness Strategy\n \n    Lennox offers a full spectrum of cooling, heating, indoor air quality and refrigeration products to meet the energy-efficient climate-control needs of residential and commercial customers across North America. We are advancing our market position through a balanced approach that includes organic growth and selective strategic investments. By effectively managing pricing and costs, we are driving margin expansion and profitability. Our success is rooted in a three-phase self-help transformation plan that continues to guide our progress over the coming years.\n     Differentiated Growth.\n  We are investing in our sales force to expand customer touchpoints, enhancing the overall customer experience through digital innovations and anticipating improved output from our new commercial HVAC factory in Mexico.  Additionally, we are focused on improving the fulfillment rate of HVAC equipment and driving higher attachment rates for parts and accessories, delivering a seamless and comprehensive solution that enhances customer satisfaction.\nResilient Profit Margins\n.  We are committed to sustaining resilient margins through pricing excellence, enhanced productivity from higher volumes, material cost reductions, and a favorable mix influenced by regulatory transitions. Together, these initiatives fortify our financial foundation and long-term competitiveness.\nExecution Management\n.  We will leverage the Lennox Unified Management System to streamline our operations and set clear priorities.  A focused strategy, investments in heat pump growth, and enhancements to our distribution network further exemplify our commitment to consistent management execution.\nMarketing and Distribution\nWe utilize multiple channels of distribution and offer different brands at various price points in order to better penetrate the HVACR markets. Our products and services are sold through a combination of direct sales, distributors and company-owned parts and supplies stores.  Dedicated sales forces and manufacturers’ representatives are deployed across our business segments and brands in a manner designed to maximize our ability to service each distribution channel.  To optimize enterprise-wide effectiveness, we have active cross-functional and cross-organizational teams coordinating approaches to pricing, product design, distribution and national account customers.\nThe North American residential heating and cooling market provides an example of the competitive strength of our marketing and distribution strategy. We use three distinct distribution approaches in this market: the company-owned distribution system, the independent distribution system and direct sales to end-users.  We distribute our “Lennox” brands in a company-owned process directly to independent dealers that install these heating and cooling products.  We distribute our “Armstrong Air,” “Ducane,” “Air-Ease,” “Concord,” “MagicPak” and “ADP Advanced Distributor Products” brands through the traditional independent distribution process pursuant to which we sell our products to distributors who, in turn, sell the products to installing contractors.  We also sell our products through our Lennox Stores.   \n \nManufacturing \nWe operate manufacturing facilities in North America and utilize the best available manufacturing techniques based on the needs of our businesses, including the use of lean manufacturing and principles of Six Sigma, a disciplined, data-driven approach and methodology for improving quality. We use numerous metrics to track and manage annual efficiency improvements. Some facilities are impacted by seasonal production demand, and we manufacture both heating and cooling products in those facilities to balance production and maintain a relatively stable labor force. We may also hire temporary employees to meet changes in demand.\nStrategic Sourcing\nWe partner with various suppliers to procure the raw materials and components used in the manufacturing of our products.  We utilize a central strategic sourcing group that consolidates purchases of certain materials, components and indirect items across business segments to maximize our purchasing strength. The goal of the strategic sourcing group is to develop global \n3\nstrategies for a given component group that focuses on developing long-term relationships that provide significant value to our businesses.  Our strategic sourcing group is focused on selecting partners that offer a competitive total cost, industry leading quality, and consistent on time delivery.  Compressors, motors and controls constitute our most significant component purchases, while steel, aluminum and copper account for the bulk of our raw material purchases. We own a minority equity interest in a joint venture that manufactures compressors for our residential and commercial heating and cooling and refrigeration businesses to help provide the necessary supply to meet customer needs.\nResearch and Development and Technology\nResearch and development is a key pillar of our growth strategy. We operate an engineering and technology organization that focuses on new technology invention, product development, product quality improvements and process enhancements, including our development of next-generation control systems as well as heating and cooling products that include some of the most efficient products in their respective categories. We leverage intellectual property and innovative designs across our businesses. We also leverage product development cycle time improvements and product data management systems to commercialize new products to market more rapidly. We use advanced, commercially available computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, computational fluid dynamics and other sophisticated design tools to streamline the design and manufacturing processes. We use complex computer simulations and analyses in the conceptual design phase before functional prototypes are created.  We also operate a full line of prototype machine equipment and advanced laboratories certified by applicable industry associations.  \n \nSeasonality\nOur sales and related segment profit tend to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because summer is the peak season for sales of air conditioning equipment and services in the U.S. and Canada.  For the same reason, our working capital needs are generally greater in the first and second quarters, and we generally have higher operating cash inflows in the third and fourth quarters.\n      HVAC markets are driven by seasonal weather patterns.  HVAC products and services are sold year round, but the volume and mix of product sales and services change significantly by season. The industry generally ships roughly twice as many units during June as it does in December. Overall, cooling equipment represents a substantial portion of the annual HVAC market. Between the heating season (roughly November through February) and cooling season (roughly May through August) are periods commonly referred to as “shoulder seasons” when the distribution channel transitions its buying patterns from one season to the next.  These seasonal fluctuations in mix and volume drive our sales and related segment profit, resulting in somewhat higher sales in the second and third quarters due to the higher volume in the cooling season relative to the heating season. \nPatents and Trademarks\nWe hold numerous patents that relate to the design and use of our products. We consider these patents important, but no single patent is material to the overall conduct of our business. We proactively obtain patents to further our strategic intellectual property objectives. We own or license several trademarks and service marks we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, and we protect our marks through national registrations and common law rights.   \nCompetition\n \nSubstantially all markets in which we participate are competitive.  The most significant competitive factors we face are product availability, reliability, energy efficiency, product performance, service, and price, with the relative importance of these factors varying among customer applications.  The following are some of the companies we view as significant competitors in each of our business segments, with relevant brand names, when different from the company name, shown in parentheses.  The marks below may be the registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names of their respective owners.\nHome Comfort Solutions\n•\nHeating & Cooling Products\n - Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier, Bryant, Payne, Tempstar, Comfortmaker, Heil, Arcoaire, KeepRite, Day & Night); Trane Technologies plc (Trane, American Standard, Ameristar, Oxbox, RunTru); Paloma Industries, Inc. (Rheem, Ruud, Weather King, Friedrich, Nortek); Johnson Controls, Inc. (York, Luxaire, Coleman, Champion); Daikin Industries, Ltd. (Daikin, Goodman, Amana, GMC); and Melrose Industries PLC (Maytag, Westinghouse, Frigidaire, Tappan, Philco, Kelvinator, Gibson, Broan, NuTone).\n4\nBuilding Climate Solutions\n•\nHeating & Cooling Products\n - Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier, ICP Commercial); Trane Technologies plc (Trane); Paloma Industries, Inc. (Rheem, Ruud); Johnson Controls, Inc. (York); Daikin Industries, Ltd. (Goodman, McQuay); and AAON, Inc.\n•\nRefrigeration Products\n - Hussmann Corporation;  Paloma Industries, Inc.

(Copeland); Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier); GEA Group (Kuba, Searle, Goedhart); Alfa Laval; Guntner GmbH; Kelvion - Profroid (Carrier); Panasonic Corp. (Sanyo); Technotrans; and Deltatherm.\nHuman Capital Management \nOur success, in large part, relies on the character of our people. That character is reflected in our core values of integrity, respect and excellence.  Our continued success depends on our ability to attract, motivate, develop and retain employees who embody our core values.\nManagement strives to maintain the right number of employees with the necessary skills to match the expected demand for the products and services we deliver. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 14,200 people.  Of these employees, approximately 5,200 were salaried and 9,000 were hourly.  The number of hourly workers varies in order to match our labor needs during periods of fluctuating demand.  \nApproximately 4,500 of our employees, including international locations, are represented by unions.  We believe we have good relationships with our employees and with the unions representing them. On November 1, 2021, our Marshalltown, Iowa-based union ratified a five-year labor agreement. We currently do not anticipate any material adverse consequences resulting from negotiations to renew other collective bargaining agreements.  \nThe Compensation & Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors is tasked with reviewing LII’s human capital management strategy and talent initiatives. The committee also reports to the full Board on these key employee matters.  \nTo succeed in an ever-changing and competitive labor market, we have identified priorities we believe are critical to our success in attracting, motivating, developing, and retaining employees.  These include, among other things: (1) providing competitive compensation and benefit programs, (2) providing career development programs, (3) promoting health and safety, and (4) championing an inclusive work environment.  Information on our sustainability commitment is available on our website. The information on our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompensation and Benefit Programs\n.\n We are committed to providing our employees with a competitive compensation package that rewards performance and achievement of desired business results.  Our compensation package consists of three primary benefits: pay (base pay and incentive programs linked to our short-term and long-term business goals), health and welfare benefits, and retirement contributions.  We analyze our compensation and benefits programs annually to remain competitive and make changes as necessary.\nCareer Development Programs. \nTo help our employees succeed in their roles and grow their careers at Lennox, we provide numerous training and development programs. One example is our “Career Journey” program which provides employees with engaging tools and resources enabling them to reflect on skills and interests, maintain an individual development plan, and explore a variety of potential career paths. Career Journey allows employees to have more meaningful career development conversations with their manager.  In addition to training and development programs, we regularly conduct succession planning reviews and have robust performance review and goal setting processes for all employees.  We believe this helps employees meet expectations throughout the year while continuing development of their long-term careers at Lennox.  \nEmployee Health and Safety.\n \nAs part of our effort to attract and retain a competitive workforce, we are committed to ensuring that every employee returns home safe at the end of each day.  Safety is our top priority and our safety programs are succeeding in identifying and reducing risks across our operations. \nInclusion and Belonging.\n \nWe are committed to an inclusive work environment built on a foundation of respect and value for people of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.  Our commitment to inclusion and belonging enables all employees to be creative, feel challenged, and thrive, which ultimately allows us to leverage the unique strengths of our employees to deliver innovative products and solutions for our customers. \nOur senior leaders, together with our human resources team, are devoted to promoting the above priorities to remain an employer of choice.  We regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our employees on a variety of subjects, including safety, communications, inclusion and belonging, management support to succeed within our company, and career growth. \n5\nDespite these efforts, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, higher employee turnover, particularly in our manufacturing and distribution locations. As a result, we have made and continue to make strong efforts to recruit qualified talent to the organization.  \n \nEnvironmental Regulation  \n  Our operations are subject to evolving and often increasingly stringent international, federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the environment.  Environmental laws and regulations affect or could affect our operations. We believe we are in substantial compliance with such existing environmental laws and regulations.  \n \nEnergy Efficiency.\n The U.S. Department of Energy has numerous active energy conservation rulemakings that impact residential and commercial heating, air conditioning and refrigeration equipment.  We are actively involved in U.S. Department of Energy activities related to energy efficiency.  In 2023, we successfully updated our lines of HVAC equipment to comply with the latest energy conservation standards from the U.S. Department of Energy.\n \nWe are prepared to have compliant products in place in advance of the effective dates of all such regulations enacted by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n \nRefrigerants. \nThe use of hydroflurocarbons (“HFCs”) as refrigerants for air conditioning and refrigeration equipment is common practice in the HVACR industry and is regulated. We believe we have complied with applicable rules and regulations in various countries governing the use of HFCs.  We are an active participant in the ongoing international and domestic dialogue on this subject and are well positioned to react in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory landscape.\n In 2020, in response to a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses, the bipartisan American Innovation and Manufacturing Act gave the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) authority to regulate HFCs and begin the phase down of refrigerants with a higher global warming potential (“GWP”). Transition to refrigerants with a GWP of 700 or less for most commercial and residential HVAC products was effective January 1, 2025.\n \nRemediation Activity\n. In addition to affecting our ongoing operations, applicable environmental laws and regulations can impose obligations to remediate hazardous substances at our properties, at properties formerly owned or operated by us and at facilities to which we have sent or send waste for treatment or disposal.  We are aware of contamination at some of our facilities; however, based on facts presently known, we do not believe that any future remediation costs at such facilities will be material to our results of operations.  For more information, see Note 5 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the past, we have received notices that we are a potentially responsible party along with other potentially responsible parties in Superfund proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act for cleanup of hazardous substances at certain sites to which the potentially responsible parties are alleged to have sent waste.  Based on the facts presently known, we do not believe environmental cleanup costs associated with any Superfund sites about which we have received notice that we are a potentially responsible party will be material to our results of operations.  \nE-Waste and Related Compliance\n. Many countries around the world as well as many states in the U.S. have enacted directives, laws, and regulations directed at preventing electrical and electronic equipment waste by encouraging reuse and recycling as well as restricting the use of hazardous products in electrical and electronic equipment.  All HVACR products and certain components of such products are potentially subject to these types of requirements.  We are not uniquely affected as compared to other manufacturers.  We actively monitor the development and evolution of such requirements and believe we are well positioned to comply with such directives in the required time frames.  \nAvailable Information\nOur web site address is www.lennox.com.  We make available, free of charge through our web site, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, including exhibits, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or review any forward-looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise unless required by law.\nThe following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements:\n•\ncompetition in the HVACR business;\n•\nour ability to successfully develop and market new products or execute our business strategy, including the implementation of price increases for products and services;\n•\nour ability to meet and anticipate customer demands;\n•\nour ability to continue to license or enforce our intellectual property rights;\n•\nour ability to attract, motivate, develop and retain our employees, as well as labor relations problems;\n•\nartificial intelligence technologies;\n•\na decline in new construction activity and related demand for our products and services;\n•\nthe impact of weather on our business;\n•\nthe impact of higher raw material prices and significant supply interruptions;\n•\nproduct liability, warranty claims, or recalls;\n•\nchanges in environmental and climate-related legislation or government regulations or policies;\n•\nchanges in tax legislation;\n•\nthe impact of new or increased trade tariffs;\n•\nimproper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners;\n•\nlitigation risks;\n•\ngeneral economic conditions in the United States and abroad;\n•\nextraordinary events beyond our control, such as conflicts, wars, natural disasters, public health crises, or terrorist acts;\n•\nrisks associated with our international operations;\n•\ncyber attacks and other disruptions or misuse of information systems; and\n•\nour ability to successfully realize, complete and integrate acquisitions.\nBusiness Overview\nWe operate in two reportable business segments of the HVACR industry, Home Comfort Solutions and Building Climate Solutions.  In addition to the two major business segments, Corporate and Other is also reported as a segment.  For more detailed information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 3 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \nIn fourth quarter 2023, we completed the sale of our European businesses.  The European businesses were presented with the Corporate and Other business segment until their divestiture.  \nWe sell our products and services through a combination of direct sales, distributors and company-owned stores.\n \nThe demand for our products and services is seasonal and can be significantly impacted by the weather.  Warmer than normal summer temperatures generate demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services, and colder than normal winter temperatures have a similar effect on heating products and services.  Conversely, cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress the demand for HVACR products and services.  In addition to weather, demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors, such as interest rates, the availability of financing, regional population and employment trends, new construction, general economic conditions and \n19\nconsumer spending habits and confidence.  A substantial portion of the sales in each of our business segments is attributable to replacement business, with the balance comprised of new construction business.\nThe principal elements of cost of goods sold are components, raw materials, factory overhead, labor, estimated costs of warranty expense and freight and distribution costs.  The principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, aluminum and copper.  In recent years, pricing volatility for these commodities and related components has impacted us and the HVACR industry in general.  We seek to mitigate the impact of certain commodity price volatility through a combination of pricing actions, vendor contracts, improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives. We also partially mitigate volatility in the prices of these commodities by entering into futures contracts and fixed forward contracts.  \nFinancial Highlights\n•\nNet sales increased $359 million, or 7%, to $5,341 million in 2024 from $4,982 million in 2023.  \n•\nOperating income in 2024 was $1,035 million compared to $790 million in 2023.  \n•\nNet income in 2024 increased to $807 million from $590 million in 2023.  \n•\nDiluted earnings per share was $22.54 per share in 2024 compared to $16.54 per share in 2023.  \n•\nWe generated $946 million of cash flow from operating activities in 2024 compared to $736 million in 2023.  \n•\nWe returned $160 million to shareholders through dividend payments in 2024. \nOverview of Results\nThe \nHome Comfort Solutions\n segment experienced an 11% increase in net sales and a \n$150 million\n increase in segment profit in \n2024\n compared to \n2023\n primarily driven by favorable price and mix and higher sales volumes.  Our \nBuilding Climate Solutions\n segment saw an increase in net sales of 17% and a \n$56 million\n increase in segment profit in \n2024\n compared to \n2023, \nprimarily due to favorable price and mix. As a result of the transition to low GWP refrigerants, customers pre-purchased R-410A equipment, which is estimated to have positively impacted revenue by $125 million.  \nResults of Operations\nThe following table provides a summary of our financial results, including information presented as a percentage of net sales (dollars in millions):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDollars\nPercent\nDollars\nPercent\nDollars\nPercent\nNet sales\n$\n5,341.3 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n4,981.9 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n4,718.4 \n100.0 \n%\nCost of goods sold\n3,569.4 \n66.8 \n%\n3,434.1 \n68.9 \n%\n3,433.7 \n72.8 \n%\nGross profit\n1,771.9 \n33.2 \n%\n1,547.8 \n31.1 \n%\n1,284.7 \n27.2 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n730.6 \n13.7 \n%\n705.5 \n14.2 \n%\n627.2 \n13.3 \n%\nLosses (gains) and other expenses, net\n12.9 \n0.2 \n%\n8.5 \n0.2 \n%\n4.9 \n0.1 \n%\nRestructuring charges\n— \n— \n%\n3.1 \n0.1 \n%\n1.5\n— \n%\nImpairment on assets held for sale\n— \n— \n%\n63.2 \n1.3 \n%\n— \n— \n%\nLoss (gain) on sale of businesses\n1.5 \n— \n%\n(14.1)\n(0.3)\n%\n— \n— \n%\nIncome from equity method investments\n(7.9)\n(0.1)\n%\n(8.5)\n(0.2)\n%\n(5.1)\n(0.1)\n%\nOperating income\n$\n1,034.8 \n19.4 \n%\n$\n790.1 \n15.9 \n%\n$\n656.2 \n13.9 \n%\nNet income\n$\n806.9 \n15.1 \n%\n$\n590.1 \n11.8 \n%\n$\n497.1 \n10.5 \n%\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023 - Consolidated Results\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased 7% in 2024 compared to 2023 as higher sales volumes of 8%, favorable price and mix of 3% and an increase of sales volumes of 1% from our AES acquisition were partially offset by a 5% reduction in sales due to the fourth quarter 2023 sale of our European businesses.\n20\nGross Profit \nGross profit margins for 2024 increased 210 basis points (“bps”) to 33.2% compared to 31.1% in 2023.  Gross profit margin increased 250 bps from higher price and favorable mix, which was partially offset by 40 bps from higher freight and distribution costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased by $25 million in 2024 compared to 2023. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 50 bps from 14.2% to 13.7% in the same periods, primarily due to higher employee-related costs including increased incentive compensation, which was partially offset by a $62 million reduction in SG&A expenses from our 2023 divestiture of our European businesses.  \n \nLosses (Gains) and Other Expenses, Net\nLosses (gains) and other expenses, net for 2024 and 2023 included the following (in millions):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nRealized losses on settled future contracts\n$\n— \n$\n0.1 \nForeign currency exchange losses (gains)\n7.7 \n(4.3)\nGain on disposal of fixed assets\n(2.1)\n(0.5)\nOther operating (income) loss\n0.5 \n(1.6)\nNet change in unrealized losses (gains) on unsettled futures contracts\n— \n(0.1)\nEnvironmental liabilities and special litigation charges\n6.8 \n15.6 \nOther items, net\n— \n(0.7)\nLosses and other expenses, net (pre-tax)\n$\n12.9 \n$\n8.5 \nThe net change in unrealized (gains) losses on unsettled futures contracts was due to changes in commodity prices relative to the unsettled futures contract prices.  For more information on our derivatives, see Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Foreign currency exchange losses increased in 2024 primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates in our primary markets.  Environmental liabilities and special legal contingency charges in 2024 relate to estimated remediation costs at some of our facilities and outstanding legal settlements including asbestos.  Refer to Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on litigation, including asbestos-related litigation, and environmental liabilities. \nRestructuring Charges\nThere were no restructuring charges in 2024 compared to $3.1 million in 2023. Charges in 2023 were related to the reorganization or removal of duplicative headcount and infrastructure.   For more information on our restructuring activities, see Note 7 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill\nWe performed a qualitative impairment analysis and noted no indicators of goodwill impairment for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on goodwill. In 2023, we recorded a $2.3 million impairment of goodwill related to our agreement to sell our European commercial HVAC and refrigeration businesses.\nAsset Impairments\nWe did not have any impairments of assets in 2024. In the third quarter of 2023, we recorded a $22.6 million impairment of property, plant and equipment related to our agreement to sell our European commercial HVAC and refrigeration businesses. \n21\nIncome from Equity Method Investments\nInvestments over which we do not exercise control but have significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  Income from equity method investments was $8 million in 2024 consistent with 2023. \nInterest Expense, net \nNet interest expense of $39 million in 2024 decreased from $52 million in 2023 primarily due to decreased borrowings on our revolving credit facility as a result of increased cash flow.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax provision was $187 million in 2024 compared to $147 million in 2023, and the effective tax rate was 18.8% in 2024 compared to 20.0% in 2023.  The 2024 and 2023 effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to lower foreign tax rates. Refer to Note 12 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on income taxes.  \nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023 - Results by Segment\nHome Comfort Solutions \nThe following table presents our Home Comfort Solutions segment’s net sales and profit for 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nDifference\n% Change\nNet sales\n$\n3,577.1 \n$\n3,222.9 \n$\n354.2 \n11%\nProfit\n$\n759.7 \n$\n610.2 \n$\n149.5 \n25%\n% of net sales\n21.2 \n%\n18.9 \n%\n \nNet sales increased 11% in 2024 compared to 2023 due to a 7% increase in volume and a 4% increase in price and mix.\nSegment profit in 2024 increased $150 million compared to 2023 primarily due to $122 million from higher price and favorable mix, $90 million from higher sales volumes and $10 million from factory productivity and favorable product costs, including LIFO.

Unrealized gains and losses on unsettled futures contracts are excluded from segment profit (loss) as they are subject to changes in fair value until their settlement date.  Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on futures contracts are a component of Losses (gains) and other expenses, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our derivatives and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our segments and for a reconciliation of segment profit to operating income.\n25\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nOur working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through internally generated funds, bank lines of credit and our commercial paper program.  Working capital needs are generally greater in the first and second quarters due to the seasonal nature of our business cycle. \nStatement of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n945.7 \n$\n736.2 \n$\n302.3 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(174.4)\n$\n(319.7)\n$\n(103.0)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(418.6)\n$\n(406.2)\n$\n(174.1)\nNet Cash Provided By Operating Activities \n- \nNet cash provided by operating activities activities increased $210 million to $946 million in 2024 compared to $736 million in 2023. \n The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $217 million.\nNet Cash Used In Investing Activities \n-\n \n Net cash used in investing activities decreased $145 million from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to lower\n capital expenditures and $95 million related to our acquisition of AES in the fourth quarter of 2023\n. Capital expenditures were $164 million, $250 million and $101 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nCapital expenditures in 2024 and 2023 were primarily related to the expansion of our manufacturing capacity including investments in our commercial HVAC factory in Mexico, equipment, and investments in systems and software to support the overall enterprise.\nNet Cash Used In Financing Activities \n-\n \nNet cash used in financing activities was $419 million in 2024 and $406 million in 2023.  The increase was primarily due to share repurchases in 2024, offset by decreased net debt repayments. We repurchased $54 million as part of our Share Repurchase Plans, as compared to no repurchases in 2023. We also returned $160 million to shareholders through dividend payments in 2024.  \nDebt Position\nThe following table details our lines of credit and financing arrangements as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\n \nOutstanding Borrowings\nCommercial paper:\n$\n— \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt:\nFinance lease obligations\n$\n14.9 \nSenior unsecured notes\n300.0 \nDebt issuance costs\n(0.4)\nTotal current maturities of long-term debt\n$\n314.5 \nLong-term debt:\nFinance lease obligations\n$\n39.5 \nCredit agreement \n(1)\n— \nSenior unsecured notes\n800.0 \nDebt issuance costs\n(6.4)\nTotal long-term debt\n$\n833.1 \nTotal debt\n$\n1,147.6 \n26\n(1) \nThe total capacity on the facility is $1.1 billion.  The amount available for future borrowings on our Credit Agreement (as defined below) is $1,098 million after being reduced by $2 million in outstanding standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2024.  \nCommercial Paper Program\nOn October 25, 2023, we established a commercial paper program (the “Program”), as a replacement to our Asset Securitization Program which expired in November 2023, pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) under the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Amounts available under the Program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the CP Notes outstanding under the Program at any time not to exceed $500.0 million. The CP Notes will have maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The CP Notes will rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuances of the CP Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. We plan to use our revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of CP Notes outstanding under the Program. There were no CP Notes outstanding under the Program as of December 31, 2024.\nCredit Agreement\nIn August 2023, we entered into the Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to our existing Credit Agreement, dated as of July 14, 2021 (as amended, the \"Credit Agreement\"), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. Under the Second Amendment, the revolving commitments were increased by $350 million\nand certain representations required to be made as conditions precedent to borrowing were revised to provide us greater flexibility to enter into additional future financings. \nOur Credit Agreement consists of a $1.1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in July 2026. We had no outstanding borrowings as well as $1.7 million committed to standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2024. Subject to covenant limitations, $1,098.3 million was available for future borrowings. The revolving credit facility includes a subfacility for swingline loans of up to $65.0 million. The Credit Agreement will expire and outstanding loans will be required to be repaid in July 2026, unless maturity is extended by the lenders pursuant to two one-year extension options that we may request under the Credit Agreement.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nIn September 2023, we issued $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which will mature in September 2028 (the \"2028 Notes\") with interest being paid semi-annually in March and September at 5.50%. We issued two series of senior unsecured notes on July 30, 2020 for $300.0 million each, which will mature on August 1, 2025 (the \"2025 Notes\") and August 1, 2027 (the \"2027 Notes\") with interest being paid semi-annually in February and August at 1.35% and 1.70% respectively, per annum (the 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2028 Notes, collectively the “Notes”). \nAll the Notes are guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by certain of our subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under our Credit Agreement. The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of the subsidiary guarantors to: create or incur certain liens; enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and enter into certain mergers, consolidations and transfers of substantially all of our assets. The indenture also contains a cross default provision which is triggered if we default on other debt of at least $75.0 million in principal which is then accelerated, and such acceleration is not rescinded within 30 days of the notice date. As of December 31, 2024, we believe we were in compliance with all covenant requirements.\nFinancial Leverage\nWe periodically review our capital structure, including our primary bank facility, to ensure the appropriate levels of liquidity and leverage and to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.  We consider various other financing alternatives and may, from time to time, access the capital markets.  \nWe also evaluate our debt-to-capital and debt-to-EBITDA ratios to determine, among other considerations, the appropriate targets for c\napital expenditures and share repurchases under our Share Repurchase Plans.  Our book value of debt-to-total-capital ratio decreased to \n57%\n at December 31, 2024 compared to 82% at December 31, 2023.  \n27\nAs of December 31, 2024, our senior credit ratings were\n Baa2 with a positive outlook, and BBB with a stable outlook, \nby Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s Rating Group (“S&P”), respectively.  The security ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Our goal is to maintain investment grade ratings from Moody’s and S&P to help ensure the capital markets remain available to us.\nLiquidity\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents of $415 million, future cash generated from operations and available future borrowings are sufficient to fund our operations, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, share repurchases, anticipated dividends and other needs in the foreseeable future.  Included in our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 was $14 million of cash held in foreign locations, although that amount can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing of cash receipts and payments. Our cash and cash equivalents held in foreign locations is generally available for use in our U.S. operations and could be subject to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes. \nNo contributions are required to be made to our U.S. defined benefit plans in 2025. No contributions were made to our pension plans in 2024.  \nDividend payments were $160 million in 2024 compared to $153 million in 2023. \nOn May 20, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 4.5% increase in our quarterly dividend on common stock from $1.10 to $1.15 per share effective with the July 2024 dividend payment.  \nDelaware law limits the ability to pay dividends to surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.  In addition, stock repurchases can only be made out of surplus and only if our capital would not be impaired. \nWe expect capital expenditures of approximately $150 million in 2025 for general capital improvement projects\n.\nFinancial Covenants related to our Debt\nThe Credit Agreement is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and contains customary covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries including limitations on indebtedness, liens, dividends, stock repurchases, mergers and sales of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the four prior fiscal quarters, a Total Net Leverage Ratio of no more than 3.50 to 1.00 (or, at our election, on up to two occasions following a material acquisition, 4.00 to 1.00). \nOur Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. These events of default include nonpayment of principal or other amounts, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, breach of covenants, default on certain other indebtedness or receivables securitizations (cross default), certain voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy events and the occurrence of a change in control. A cross default under our credit facility could occur if:\n•\nWe fail to pay any principal or interest when due on any other indebtedness or receivables securitization exceeding $75.0 million; or\n•\nWe are in default in the performance of, or compliance with any term of any other indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount exceeding $75.0 million, or any other condition exists which would give the holders the right to declare such indebtedness due and payable prior to its stated maturity. \nEach of our major debt agreements contains provisions by which a default under one agreement causes a default in the others (a cross default). If a cross default under our Credit Agreement or our senior unsecured notes were to occur, it could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise occur from a default of a single debt instrument or lease commitment.\nIf any event of default occurs and is continuing, the administrative agent, or lenders with a majority of the aggregate commitments may require the administrative agent to, terminate our right to borrow under our Credit Agreement and accelerate amounts due under our Credit Agreement (except for a bankruptcy event of default, in which case such amounts will automatically become due and payable and the lenders’ commitments will automatically terminate).\nIn the event of a credit rating downgrade below investment grade resulting from a change of control, holders of our senior unsecured notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the senior unsecured notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The notes are guaranteed, on \n28\na senior unsecured basis, by each of our subsidiaries that guarantee payment by us of any indebtedness under our Credit Agreement.  The indenture governing the notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of the subsidiary guarantors to: create or incur certain liens; enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; enter into certain mergers, consolidations and transfers of substantially all of our assets; and transfer certain properties. The indenture also contains a cross default provision which is triggered if we default on other debt of at least $75 million in principal which is then accelerated, and such acceleration is not rescinded within 30 days of the notice date.\nWe are currently in compliance with all covenant requirements.\nLeasing Commitments\nRefer to Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on our leasing commitments.\nGuarantees related to our Debt Obligations\nOur senior unsecured notes were issued by Lennox International Inc. (the “Parent”) and are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries (the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”) and are not secured by our other subsidiaries.  The Guarantor Subsidiaries are 100% owned and consolidated, all guarantees are full and unconditional, and all guarantees are joint and several.\nThe following combined Parent and Guarantor Subsidiaries financial information is presented as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2024 (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCurrent assets\n$\n1,713.9 \n$\n1,291.0 \nNon-current assets\n6,995.0 \n5,737.1 \nCurrent liabilities\n1,084.9 \n843.3 \nNon-current liabilities\n1,266.8 \n1,477.3 \nAmounts due to non-guarantor subsidiaries\n(536.8)\n(472.3)\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet Sales\n$\n5,265.6 \n$\n4,626.8 \nGross Profit\n1,363.8 \n1,157.8 \nNet Income\n1,792.5 \n1,331.1 \nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. \nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations arise in the normal course of business and include debt and related interest payments, leases, purchase obligations, pension and post-retirement benefits and warranty liabilities.  For additional information regarding our contractual obligations, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and post-retirement benefits obligations.  See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our debt obligations.\nFair Value Measurements\n \nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  Fair value is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date and requires consideration of our creditworthiness when valuing certain liabilities.  Our framework for measuring fair value is based on a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements.\nThe three-level fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements is defined as follows:\n29\nLevel 1\n -          Quoted prices for \nidentical\n instruments in active markets at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - \n    Quoted prices for \nsimilar\n instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are \nobservable\n in active markets at the measurement date and for the anticipated term of the instrument.\nLevel 3\n -     Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are \nunobservable\n inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nWhere available, the fair values were based upon quoted prices in active markets. However, if quoted prices were not available, then the fair values were based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or independently sourced market parameters, such as credit default swap spreads, yield curves, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, interest rates and benchmark securities. For assets and liabilities without observable market activity, if any, the fair values were based upon discounted cash flow methodologies incorporating assumptions that, in our judgment, reflect the assumptions a marketplace participant would use.  Valuation adjustments to reflect either party’s creditworthiness and ability to pay were incorporated into our valuations, where appropriate, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the measurement dates.  See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\nMarket Risk\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe enter into commodity futures contracts to stabilize prices expected to be paid for raw materials and parts containing high copper and aluminum content. These contracts are for quantities equal to or less than quantities expected to be consumed in future production.  Fluctuations in metal commodity prices impact the value of the futures contracts that we hold.  When metal commodity prices rise, the fair value of our futures contracts increases.  Conversely, when commodity prices fall, the fair value of our futures contracts decreases.  Information about our exposure to metal commodity price market risks and a sensitivity analysis related to our metal commodity hedges is presented below (in millions): \nNotional amount (pounds of aluminum and copper)\n105.9 \nCarrying amount and fair value of net asset\n$\n(0.4)\nChange in fair value from 10% change in forward prices\n$\n10.6 \nRefer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commodity futures contracts.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur results of operations can be affected by changes in interest rates due to variable rates of interest on our debt facilities, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.  A 10% adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve would have resulted in an increase to pre-tax interest expense of approximately $0.9 million, $2.3 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nFrom time to time, we may use an interest rate swap hedging strategy to eliminate the variability of cash flows in a portion of our interest payments.  This strategy, when employed, allows us to fix a portion of our interest payments when interest rates are low.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no interest rate swaps were in effect.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nOur results of operations are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Net sales and expenses in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes based on the average exchange rate for the period.  Our primary exposure to foreign currencies are the Canadian dollar, Mexican Peso, and the Euro.  During 2024, 2023 and 2022, net sales from outside the U.S. represented 6.0%, 11.3% and 11.4%, respectively, of our total net sales.  For the years ended December 31, 2024,  2023, and 2022, foreign currency transaction gains and losses did not have a material impact to our results \n30\nof operations.  A 10% change in foreign exchange rates would have had an estimated $2.6 million, $5.6 million and $3.5 million impact to net income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe seek to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on certain short-term transactions by periodically entering into foreign currency forward contracts.  By entering into forward contracts, we lock in exchange rates that would otherwise cause losses should the U.S. dollar appreciate and gains should the U.S. dollar depreciate.  Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our foreign currency forward contracts.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nA critical accounting estimate is one that requires difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to our results of operations and financial condition.  The following describes our critical accounting estimate related to product warranties and product-related contingencies and how we develop our judgments, assumptions and estimates about future events and how such policies can impact our financial statements. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nProduct Warranties and Product-Related Contingencies\nThe estimate of our liability for future warranty costs requires us to make assumptions about the amount, timing and nature of future product-related costs.  Some of the warranties we issue extend 10 years or more in duration and a relatively small adjustment to an assumption may have a significant impact on our overall liability.  \nFrom time to time, we may also incur costs to repair or replace installed products experiencing quality issues in order to satisfy our customers and protect our brand.  These product-related costs may not be covered under our warranties and are not covered by insurance.  \nWe periodically review the assumptions used to determine the liabilities for product warranties and product-related contingencies and we adjust our assumptions based upon factors such as actual failure rates and cost experience.  Numerous factors could affect actual failure rates and cost experience, including the amount and timing of new product introductions, changes in manufacturing techniques or locations, components or suppliers used.  Should actual costs differ from our estimates, we may be required to adjust the liabilities and to record expense in future periods.  See Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our product warranties and product-related contingencies.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our financial statements and disclosures.",
