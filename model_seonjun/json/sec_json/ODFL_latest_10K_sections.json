MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\n FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations generally discusses our 2024 and 2023 results and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of our 2023 results and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2024.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nWe are one of the largest North American less-than-truckload (“LTL”) motor carriers. We provide regional, inter-regional and national LTL services through a single integrated, union-free organization. Our service offerings, which include expedited transportation, are provided through an expansive network of service centers located throughout the continental United States. Through strategic alliances, we also provide LTL services throughout North America. In addition to our core LTL services, we offer a range of value-added services including container drayage, truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting. More than 98% of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting LTL shipments for our customers, whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the U.S. domestic economy.\n\n\nIn analyzing the components of our revenue, we monitor changes and trends in our LTL volumes and LTL revenue per hundredweight. While LTL revenue per hundredweight is a yield measurement, it is also a commonly-used indicator for general pricing trends in the LTL industry. This yield metric is not a true measure of price, however, as it can be influenced by many other factors, such as changes in fuel surcharges, weight per shipment and length of haul. As a result, changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates. LTL revenue per hundredweight and the key factors that can impact this metric are described in more detail below:\n\n\n•\nLTL Revenue Per Hundredweight\n - Our LTL transportation services are generally priced based on weight, commodity, and distance. This measurement reflects the application of our pricing policies to the services we provide, which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth objectives. Generally, freight is rated by a class system, which is established by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association, Inc. Light, bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per hundredweight than dense, heavy freight. Fuel surcharges, accessorial charges, revenue adjustments and revenue for undelivered freight are included in this measurement, and we regularly monitor the components that impact our pricing. The fuel surcharge is generally designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of our petroleum-based products and is indexed to diesel fuel prices published by the U.S. Department of Energy, which reset each week. Revenue for undelivered freight is deferred for financial statement purposes in accordance with our revenue recognition policy; however, we believe including it in our revenue per hundredweight metrics results in a more accurate representation of the underlying changes in our yields by matching total billed revenue with the corresponding weight of those shipments.\n\n\n•\nLTL Weight Per Shipment\n - Fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the mix of freight we receive from our customers, as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment. Generally, increases in weight per shipment indicate higher demand for our customers’ products and overall increased economic activity. Changes in weight per shipment can also be influenced by shifts between LTL and other modes of transportation, such as truckload and intermodal, in response to capacity, service and pricing issues. Fluctuations in weight per shipment generally have an inverse effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as a decrease in weight per shipment will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight.\n\n\n•\nAverage Length of Haul\n - We consider lengths of haul less than 500 miles to be regional traffic, lengths of haul between 500 miles and 1,000 miles to be inter-regional traffic, and lengths of haul in excess of 1,000 miles to be national traffic. This metric is used to analyze our tonnage and pricing trends for shipments with similar characteristics, and also allows for comparison with other transportation providers serving specific markets. By analyzing this metric, we can determine the success and growth potential of our service products in these markets. Changes in length of haul generally have a direct effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as an increase in length of haul will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight.\n\n\n•\nLTL Revenue Per Shipment\n - This measurement is primarily determined by the three metrics listed above and is used in conjunction with the number of LTL shipments we receive to evaluate LTL revenue.\n\n\n \n22\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur primary revenue focus is to increase density, which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure. Increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity, which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor, pickup and delivery (“P&D”) stops per hour, P&D shipments per hour, platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour. In addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies, it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield, which is measured as revenue per hundredweight, on the shipments we handle. We focus on the profitability of each customer account and generally seek to obtain an appropriate yield to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in capacity and technology. We believe the continued execution of this yield-management philosophy, continued increases in density, and ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies are the key components of our ability to further improve our operating ratio and long-term profitable growth.\n\n\nOur primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight, operating supplies and expenses, which include diesel fuel, and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities. We gauge our overall\n \nsuccess in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio, a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue, which also allows for industry-wide comparisons with our competition.\n\n\nWe regularly upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs. Our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network, increases the productivity of our workforce, and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes.\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the years indicated, expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from

financial results for 2024 reflect continued softness in the domestic economy that contributed to the decline in our revenue. Despite the decrease in our LTL tons, we maintained a commitment to providing superior customer service to support the continued improvement in our yield as we provided our customers with 99% on-time service and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1% during the year. We maintained our focus on operating efficiently and controlling discretionary spending during the year, but the increase in costs and the deleveraging effect from the decrease in revenue led to an increase in our operating ratio. As a result, our net income and diluted earnings per share decreased by 4.3% and 2.7%, respectively, as compared to 2023.\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\nRevenue decreased $51.3 million, or 0.9%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due to a decrease in volumes that was partially offset by an increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. LTL tonnage per day decreased 3.6% primarily due to decreases in LTL shipments per day and LTL weight per shipment. This decrease in our volumes was partially offset by a 2.4% increase in our LTL revenue per hundredweight. Our LTL revenue per hundredweight includes the impact of lower fuel surcharges resulting from a decline in the average price of diesel fuel from the comparable period. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 5.0% in 2024 as compared to 2023. We believe the increase in our LTL revenue-per-hundredweight metrics was driven by the ongoing execution of our yield management strategy. Our consistent, cost-based approach to pricing focuses on offsetting our cost inflation while also supporting additional investments into our business to expand capacity and enhance our technology.\n\n\nJanuary 2025 Update\n\n\nRevenue per day decreased 4.2% in January 2025 compared to the same month last year. LTL tons per day decreased 7.1%, due primarily to a 5.4% decrease in LTL shipments per day and a 1.7% decrease in LTL weight per shipment. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 3.1% as compared to the same month last year. LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 4.5% as compared to the same month last year.\n\n\nOperating Costs and Other Expenses\n\n\nSalaries, wages, and benefits increased $59.6 million, or 2.3%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, due to a $46.1 million increase in salaries and wages and a $13.5 million increase in employee benefit costs. The increase in salaries and wages was due primarily to the annual wage increase provided to our employees at the beginning of both September 2023 and 2024.\n\n\nOur productive labor costs, which include wages for drivers, platform employees, and fleet technicians, increased as a percent of revenue to 24.1% in 2024 from 23.6% in 2023. We continued to operate efficiently in 2024, despite the decrease in network density that generally results from the decline in volumes. Our P&D shipments and stops per hour both improved in 2024 as compared to 2023, which helped offset the reduction in our linehaul laden load factor. Our other salaries and wages as a percent of revenue also increased to 9.5% in 2024 as compared to 9.0% in 2023.\n\n\n \n24\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe cost attributable to employee benefits increased $13.5 million, or 1.9%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to the annual wage increase as well as an increase in costs associated with our group health and dental plans. This increase in employee benefit costs was partially offset by lower retirement benefit plan costs directly linked to our net income. Our employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages remained relatively consistent at 37.3% in 2024 compared to 37.5% in 2023.\n \n\n\nOperating supplies and expenses decreased $83.0 million, or 11.6%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, due primarily to decreases in our costs for diesel fuel used in our vehicles and lower maintenance and repair costs. The cost of diesel fuel, excluding fuel taxes, represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses, and can vary based on both the average price per gallon and consumption. Our average cost per gallon of diesel fuel decreased 14.6% in 2024 as compared to 2023. We do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments; therefore, our costs are subject to market price fluctuations. Our gallons consumed also decreased 3.5% in 2024 as compared to 2023 due primarily to a decrease in our miles driven. Our other operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue decreased in 2024 as compared to 2023 due primarily to lower maintenance and repair costs, as we improved the average age of our fleet by consistently executing on our capital expenditure programs.\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased $20.1 million, or 6.2%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increases in depreciation and amortization costs were due primarily to the assets acquired as part of our 2023 and 2024 capital expenditure programs. We believe depreciation costs will continue to increase in future periods based on our 2025 capital expenditure plan. While our investments in real estate, equipment, and technology can increase our short-term costs, we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued long-term growth and strategic initiatives.\n\n\nOur effective tax rate in 2024 was 23.9% as compared to 24.8% in 2023. Our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate due to the impact of state taxes and, to a lesser extent, certain other non-deductible items. In 2024, our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the purchase of federal tax credits and other discrete tax adjustments.\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\nA summary of our cash flows is presented below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n433,799\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n186,312\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash flows provided by (used in):\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,659,283\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,569,135\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(751,194\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(659,820\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancing activities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,233,212\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(661,828\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(325,123\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n247,487\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n108,676\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n433,799\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe change in our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2024 as compared to 2023 was due primarily to the $139.5 million increase in certain other working capital accounts partially offset by the $53.4 million decrease in net income.\n \n\n\nThe change in our cash flows used in investing activities during 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to the timing of purchases and maturities of short-term investments and an increase in expenditures under our 2024 capital expenditure program. Additionally, we had lower proceeds from the sale of property and equipment in 2024 as compared to 2023. Changes in our capital expenditures are more fully described below in “Capital Expenditures.”\n \n\n\nThe change in our cash flows used in financing activities during 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock, as well as an increase in dividend payments to our shareholders during 2024. Our return of capital to shareholders is more fully described below under “Stock Repurchase Program” and “Dividends to Shareholders.” Our long-term debt agreement is more fully described below under “Financing Arrangements.”\n\n\nWe have four primary sources of available liquidity: cash flows from operations, our existing cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings under our third amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association serving as administrative agent for the lenders, dated March 22, 2023 (as subsequently amended, the “Credit Agreement”), and our Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with PGIM, Inc. (“Prudential”) and certain affiliates and managed accounts of Prudential (as subsequently amended, the “Note Agreement”). The Credit Agreement and the Note Agreement are described in more detail below under “Financing Arrangements.” We believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity, if needed.\n\n\n \n25\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\n\nThe table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand and structures\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n373,416\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n291,070\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTractors\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n218,682\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n203,417\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailers\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n103,919\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n181,534\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28,037\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44,358\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther equipment and assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n47,264\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n36,930\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Proceeds from sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(20,124\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(48,637\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n751,194\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n708,672\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur capital expenditures vary based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities necessary to support our plan for long-term growth, our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle, and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth. Expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the geographic areas where we are looking to expand. We historically spend 10% to 15% of our revenue on capital expenditures each year, and we generally expect to continue to maintain a level of capital expenditures in order to support our long-term plan for market share growth. There could be years, however, where our annual capital expenditures plan is above or below this range as we balance the size of our service center network and operating fleet with anticipated growth.\n \n\n\nWe currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately $575 million for the year ending December 31, 2025. Approximately $300 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities, construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities, subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects; approximately $225 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers; and approximately $50 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets. We expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations, our existing cash and cash equivalents and, if needed, borrowings available under the Credit Agreement or Note Agreement. We believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months and in the longer term.\n\n\nStock Repurchase Program\n\n\nOn July 28, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock (the “2021 Repurchase Program”). The 2021 Repurchase Program began after completion of our prior repurchase program in January 2022 and was completed in May 2024. On July 26, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $3.0 billion of our outstanding common stock (the “2023 Repurchase Program”). The 2023 Repurchase Program, which does not have an expiration date, began after the completion of the 2021 Repurchase Program in May 2024.\n \n\n\nUnder our repurchase programs, we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions. Shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase programs are canceled at the time of repurchase and are classified as authorized but unissued shares of our common stock.\n\n\nOn May 28, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “ASR Agreement”) with a third-party financial institution. The ASR Agreement was accounted for as a settled treasury stock purchase and a forward stock purchase contract. The par value of the initial shares received was recorded as a reduction to common stock, with the excess purchase price recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. The forward stock purchase contract was accounted for as a contract indexed to our own stock and is classified within capital in excess of par value on our Balance Sheets. The ASR Agreement was settled with the final number of shares received based on the daily volume-weighted average share price of our common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. Under the ASR Agreement, we paid the third-party financial institution $200.0 million and received an initial delivery of 923,201 shares of our common stock for $160.0 million, representing approximately 80% of the total value of shares to be received by us under the ASR Agreement, and the remaining balance of $40.0 million was settled in November 2024. We repurchased a total of 1,056,213 shares for $200.0 million under the ASR Agreement.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $2.26 billion remaining authorized under the 2023 Repurchase Program.\n\n\n \n26\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDividends to Shareholders\n\n\nOn February 16, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our common stock for shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of March 13, 2024. On March 27, 2024, those shareholders received one additional share of common stock for every share owned.\n\n\nAll references in this report to dividend amounts have been restated retroactively to reflect this stock split. Split-adjusted per-share metrics may not recalculate precisely due to rounding.\n\n\nOur Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share for each quarter of 2024, declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share for each quarter of 2023 and declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share for each quarter of 2022.\n \n\n\nOn February 5, 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a cash dividend of $0.28 per share of our common stock. The dividend is payable on March 19, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 5, 2025. Although we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock for the foreseeable future, the declaration and amount of any future dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors, and is restricted by applicable state law limitations on distributions to shareholders as well as certain covenants under our Credit Agreement and Note Agreement. We anticipate that any future quarterly cash dividends will be funded through cash flows from operations, our existing cash and cash equivalents, and, if needed, borrowings under our Credit Agreement or Note Agreement.\n\n\nFinancing Agreements\n\n\nNote Agreement\n\n\nThe Note Agreement, which is uncommitted and subject to Prudential’s sole discretion, provides for the issuance of senior promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of up to $350.0 million through March 22, 2026. On May 4, 2020, we issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior promissory notes (the “Series B Notes”). Borrowing availability under the Note Agreement is reduced by the outstanding amount of the existing Series B Notes, and all other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the Note Agreement.\n\n\nThe Series B Notes bear interest at 3.10% per annum and mature on May 4, 2027, unless prepaid. The first two principal payments of $20.0 million each were paid on May 4, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The remaining $60.0 million will be paid in three equal annual installments of $20.0 million through May 4, 2027. The Series B Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with borrowings under the Credit Agreement or other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the Note Agreement.\n\n\nCredit Agreement\n\n\n The Credit Agreement, which matures in May 2028, provides for a five-year, $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit and a $150.0 million accordion feature, which if fully exercised and approved, would expand the total borrowing capacity up to an aggregate of $400.0 million. Of the $250.0 million line of credit commitments under the Credit Agreement, up to $100.0 million may be used for letters of credit.\n \n\n\nAt our option, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either: (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus the Term SOFR Adjustment, as defined in the Credit Agreement, equal to 0.100%, plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.000% to 1.375%; or (ii) a Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus an applicable margin that ranges from 0.000% to 0.375%. The applicable margin for each of the foregoing options is dependent upon our consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio. Letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for SOFR loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter. Commitment fees ranging from 0.090% to 0.175% (based upon our consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio) are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the Credit Agreement.\n \n\n\nFor periods covered under the Credit Agreement, the applicable margin on SOFR loans and letter of credit fees were 1.000% and commitment fees were 0.090%.\n\n\nThe Credit Agreement replaced our previous five-year, $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of November 21, 2019 (the “Prior Credit Agreement”). For periods in 2023 covered under the Prior Credit Agreement, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans and letter of credit fees was 1.000% and commitment fees were 0.100%.\n\n\n \n27\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe amounts outstanding and available borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement are presented below:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility limit\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n250,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n250,000\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine of credit borrowings\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding letters of credit\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(37,702\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(39,966\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable borrowing capacity\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n212,298\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n210,034\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGeneral Debt Provisions\n\n\nThe Credit Agreement and Note Agreement contain customary covenants, including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The Credit Agreement and Note Agreement also include a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments, including dividends and payments for share repurchases, unless, among other conditions, no defaults or events of default are ongoing (or would be caused by such restricted payment). We were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\nWe do not anticipate financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future, and we believe the combination of our existing Credit Agreement and Note Agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and long-term capital needs.\n \n\n\nThe interest rate is fixed on the Series B Notes. Therefore, short-term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our Credit Agreement. We do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.\n\n\nContractual Obligations\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPayments due by period\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContractual Obligations \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLess than\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMore than\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In thousands)\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1 year\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1-3 years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3-5 years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5 years\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeries B Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n62,492\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n21,451\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n41,041\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating lease obligations\n \n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n128,104\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20,548\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39,245\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33,577\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34,734\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchase obligations and Other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n285,546\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n238,195\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28,655\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,195\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,501\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n476,142\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n280,194\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n108,941\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n46,772\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n40,235\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nContractual obligations include principal and interest on our Series B Notes; leases consisting primarily of real estate and automotive leases; and purchase obligations relating to (i) non-cancellable purchase orders for equipment scheduled for delivery in 2025, (ii) non-cancellable purchase orders for information technology agreements, and (iii) federal tax credits.\n\n\n \n\n\n(2)\nLease payments include lease extensions that are reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\n\nIn preparing our financial statements, we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These critical accounting policies, which are those that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, are further described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\nOur revenue is generated from providing transportation and related services to customers in accordance with the bill of lading (“BOL”) contract, our general tariff provisions and contractual agreements. Generally, our performance obligations begin when we receive a BOL from a customer and are satisfied when we complete the delivery of a shipment and related services. We recognize revenue for our performance obligations under our customer contracts over time, as our customers receive the benefits of our services in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n (“ASC Topic 606”). With respect to services not completed at the end of a reporting period, we use a percentage of completion method to allocate\n \n\n\n \n28\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthe appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period. Under this method, we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule. This factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly. Changes in economic conditions, customer creditworthiness, pricing arrangements and other factors may significantly impact revenue recognition estimates.\n\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\n\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. We use historical experience, certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset. When indicators of impairment exist, we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions, and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate.\n\n\nEstimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years, revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years, other equipment is 2 to 20 years, and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease. The use of different assumptions, estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets. Depreciation expense in 2024 totaled $344.5 million. There have been no material effects to estimates related to depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\nClaims and Insurance Accruals\n\n\nClaims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of various claims, including those related to bodily injury/property damage (“BIPD”) and workers’ compensation. All related costs associated with BIPD claims are charged to insurance and claims expense, and all related costs associated with workers’ compensation claims are charged to employee benefits expense.\n\n\nInsurers providing excess coverage above a company’s self-insured retention or deductible levels typically adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors. As a result, we periodically evaluate our self-insured retention and deductible levels to determine the most cost-efficient balance between our exposure and excess coverage.\n\n\nIn establishing accruals for claims and expenses, we evaluate and monitor each claim individually, and we use factors such as historical claims development experience, known trends and third-party actuarial estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liabilities. We believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable; however, any changes in the severity or number of reported claims, significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods. Our accrued liability for BIPD and workers’ compensation claims totaled $137.3 million and $127.0 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Claims and insurance accruals are discussed further in Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\n\nInflation\n\n\nMost of our expenses are affected by inflation, which typically results in increased operating costs. In response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products, particularly diesel fuel, we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements. The fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and fluctuates as diesel fuel prices change from the base, which is generally indexed to the DOE’s published fuel prices that reset each week. Volatility in the price of diesel fuel has impacted our business, as described in this report. However, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any of the past three years.\n\n\nRelated Party Transactions\n\n\nFamily Relationships\n\n\nJohn R. Congdon, Jr., a member of our Board of Directors, is the cousin of David S. Congdon, Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors. We regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals, as well as the compensation paid to any of their family members employed by us that from time to time may require disclosure, in the proxy statement for our Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\n\n\n \n29\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAudit Committee Approval\n\n\nThe Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and approves all related person transactions in accordance with our Related Person Transactions Policy.",
