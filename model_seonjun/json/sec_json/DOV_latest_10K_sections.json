BUSINESS\nOverview\nDover Corporation is a diversified global manufacturer and solutions provider delivering innovative equipment and components, consumable supplies, aftermarket parts, software and digital solutions and support services through five operating segments: Engineered Products, Clean Energy & Fueling, Imaging & Identification, Pumps & Process Solutions, and Climate & Sustainability Technologies. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references herein to \"Dover,\" \"the Company,\" and words such as \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\" include Dover Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Dover was incorporated in 1947 in the State of Delaware and became a publicly traded company in 1955. Dover is headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois and currently employs approximately 24,000 people worldwide.\nDover's five segments are structured around businesses with similar business models, go-to-market strategies, product categories, and manufacturing practices. This structure increases management efficiency and better aligns Dover's operations with its strategic initiatives and capital allocation priorities, and provides greater transparency about performance to external stakeholders. Dover's five operating and reportable segments are as follows: \n•\nOur Engineered Products segment provides a wide range of equipment, components, software, solutions and services to the vehicle aftermarket, aerospace and defense, industrial winch and hoist, and fluid dispensing end-markets. \n•\nOur Clean Energy & Fueling segment provides components, equipment, software solutions and services enabling safe and reliable storage, transport and dispensing of traditional and clean fuels (including liquefied natural gas, hydrogen, and electric vehicle charging), cryogenic gases, and other hazardous substances along the supply chain, and safe and efficient operation of convenience retail, retail fueling and vehicle wash establishments. \n•\nOur Imaging & Identification segment supplies precision marking and coding, product traceability, brand protection and digital textile printing equipment, as well as related consumables, software and services to the global packaged and consumer goods, pharmaceutical, industrial manufacturing, textile and other end-markets.\n•\nOur Pumps & Process Solutions segment manufactures specialty pumps and flow meters, fluid transfer connectors, highly engineered precision components, instruments and digital controls for rotating and reciprocating machines, and polymer processing equipment, serving single-use biopharmaceutical production, diversified industrial manufacturing applications, chemical production, plastics and polymer processing, midstream and downstream oil and gas, clean energy markets, thermal management, food and beverage, semiconductor production and medical applications and other end-markets. \n•\nOur Climate & Sustainability Technologies segment is a provider of innovative and energy-efficient equipment, components, solutions, services and parts for the commercial refrigeration, heating and cooling and beverage can-making equipment end-markets.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn October 8, 2024, the Company completed the sale of the Environmental Solutions Group (\"ESG\") business, an operating company within the Engineered Products segment, for total consideration, net of cash transferred, of $2.0 billion. As the disposal represented a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, the Company has classified ESG's results of operations prior to the sale as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The discussion throughout Item 1 of this Form 10-K, unless otherwise noted, relates solely to our continuing operations. For more details, see Note 4 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n4    \nTable of Contents\nManagement Philosophy \nDover is committed to delivering shareholder value creation through a combination of sustained profitable growth, operational excellence, superior free cash flow generation and productive capital re-deployment while adhering to a conservative financial policy. Dover seeks to be a leader in a diverse set of growing markets where customers are loyal to trusted partners and suppliers, and value product performance and differentiation driven by superior engineering, manufacturing precision, total solution development and excellent supply chain performance. Our businesses are long-time leaders in their respective markets and are known for their innovation, engineering capability and customer service excellence. We aim to continue growing our businesses from this strong foundation. \nOur operating structure of five business segments allows for a differentiated acquisition focus consistent with our portfolio and capital allocation priorities. We believe our business segment structure, coupled with value-creating functional expertise at our lean corporate center, presents opportunities to identify and capture operating synergies, such as global sourcing and supply chain integration, centralized shared services, cross-pollination of manufacturing best practices, and further advances the development of our executive talent. Our executive management team sets strategic direction, initiatives and goals, develops effective incentive structures, provides oversight of strategy execution and achievement of these goals for our business segments, and with oversight from our Board of Directors, makes capital allocation decisions, including with respect to organic investment initiatives, major capital projects, acquisitions, divestitures, and the return of capital to our shareholders. \nOur goal is to foster an operating culture with high ethical and performance standards that values accountability, rigor, trust, inclusion, respect and open communications, designed to allow individual growth and operational effectiveness. We are also increasing our focus on maintaining sustainable business practices that reduce environmental impact, and developing products that help our customers meet their sustainability goals. \nCompany Goals\n \nWe are committed to driving superior shareholder returns through three key tenets of our corporate strategy. \nFirst\n, we are committed to achieving organic sales growth above that of gross domestic product (4% to 6% annually on average) over a long-term business cycle, absent prolonged adverse economic conditions, complemented by growth through strategic acquisitions. \nSecond\n, we continue to focus on improving returns on capital, as well as earnings margin, by enhancing our operational capabilities and making investments across the organization in growth capacity expansion, digital capabilities, automation, operations management, information technology (\"IT\"), shared services (including Dover Business Services and our India Innovation Center), and talent. We also focus on continuous, effective cost management and productivity initiatives, such as supply chain optimization, automation and productivity capital expenditures, e-commerce and digital go-to-market, restructuring, product complexity reduction, improved footprint utilization, strategic pricing and portfolio management. \nThird\n, we aim to generate growth in free cash flow and earnings per share through strong earnings performance, productivity improvements and active working capital management, which is enhanced by opportunistic divestitures allowing for concentration on growing our core platforms. Dover prioritizes deploying free cash flow toward high-return and high-confidence organic reinvestments aimed at growing, improving and strengthening our businesses, as well as through inorganic investments that synergistically enhance the quality of our portfolio. Dover's value creation strategy is supported by a financial policy that includes a prudent approach to financial leverage, and a disciplined approach to capital allocation that allows for a balance between reinvestment and return of capital to shareholders through growing dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. \nWe support achievement of these goals by (1) aligning management compensation with strategic and financial objectives, (2) actively managing our portfolio to increase enterprise scale, improving business mix over time to markets with secular growth characteristics, and pursuing acquisitions that fit the characteristics of an ideal Dover business and (3) investing in talent development programs.\n5    \nTable of Contents\nCharacteristics of a Dover Business\nFor over 70 years, Dover has successfully and profitably operated a diversified portfolio of high-quality businesses serving a wide variety of industrial and business-to-business end markets with different business models. We believe this diversity is a strength of our portfolio, providing Dover with multiple avenues for organic and inorganic growth, lower cyclicality, and the ability to extract synergies of common ownership. While we expect our portfolio to remain diversified, we also strive to shape the portfolio over time to increase common attractive attributes across our businesses. \nDover is adept at operating businesses within two core operating models:\n•\nComponent Businesses\n: Many of our businesses produce critical components that represent a small portion of a larger system by cost. For example, our industrial and biopharma pumps, biopharma connectors, engineered bearings and compression components, clean energy components, and heat exchangers are all part of larger systems built or employed by our customers. Such components typically serve demanding applications where value-in-use and costs and risks of switching far exceed the cost of the component itself. \n•\nEquipment with Aftermarket Opportunity\n: Many of our businesses produce complex and highly engineered equipment and systems that require a significant and predictable volume of parts, consumables, software and services over their life cycle. For example, our marking and coding equipment, plastics and polymer processing equipment and aluminum can-making equipment all derive a significant share of revenue and profits from sale of consumables, parts and services into their large installed base. Recurring demand, which includes parts, consumables, services and software, represents approximately 36% of our revenue. \nWe see the following commonalities characterizing the majority of Dover businesses:\n•\nAttractive Markets\n: Our businesses generally operate in strategically attractive niche industrial markets with proven and well-understood long-term growth trends, favorable customer and supplier landscapes, mature and incrementally improving technologies with opportunities for technological differentiation, and highly loyal customers, suppliers or channel partners.\n•\nLeading Positions\n: Our businesses are long-time leaders in their respective markets and have consistently enjoyed customer bases that choose products primarily based on their performance, track record, safety and compliance. \n•\nDigital Opportunity\n: Our equipment and components are often complemented by value-added digital applications, including connected products, sensors, digital controls and industry-specific software that create new sources of value for our customers.\n•\nAttractive Financial Profile\n: Our businesses exhibit attractive financial profiles, characterized by predictable, stable revenue, low capital intensity, strong cash-flow and sustainable returns on invested capital well in excess of our cost of capital. \nBusiness Strategy \nDover seeks to create value for shareholders by combining the global scale and capabilities, as well as access to capital, of a diversified industrial enterprise with the agility and entrepreneurial dynamism of niche manufacturing businesses. We believe the centralized scale of the corporation provides a distinct competitive advantage to our individual operating businesses through (i) driving efficiency gains and economies of scale of shared global resources across the corporation, (ii) freeing management time and effort to focus on the most important aspects of their businesses, including servicing and addressing the critical needs of their customers, aligning their business to capitalize on key market trends and focusing on product excellence, and (iii) access to centralized talent and expertise that our individual operating businesses otherwise may not have on their own. To achieve our stated goals, we are focused on executing the following pillars of Dover's business strategy: \nCapturing growth potential in our end-markets and adjacent market segments\nDover’s business segments are focused on building enduring competitive advantages and leadership positions in markets we believe are positioned for sustained future growth. We believe our businesses are among the top suppliers in most markets and niches we serve (as defined by customer applications, geographies or products), which positions us well to capture future growth. We capitalize on our engineering, intellectual property, technology and design expertise, and maintain an intense focus on meeting the needs of our customers and on adding significant, and often new, value to their operations through \n6    \nTable of Contents\nsuperior product performance, safety, reliability, and a commitment to aftermarket support. We cultivate and maintain an entrepreneurial culture to enable business agility, and continuously innovate to address our customers' needs, to help them win in the markets they serve.\nIn particular, our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on: growing industrial manufacturing and trade volumes; an increased global focus on digitization and automation in industrial processes; increasing requirements for sustainability, safety, energy efficiency and consumer product safety; and growth of the middle class and consumption in emerging economies. \n•\nOur Engineered Products segment is capitalizing on global infrastructure investment, an increasing number of vehicles in operation, average car age and annual miles driven, increasing digitization and sensorization of modern vehicles, as well as growing defense spending related to signal intelligence and electronic warfare.\n \n•\nOur Clean Energy & Fueling segment benefits from the worldwide growth in environmental safety and compliance regulations, new infrastructure build-out in emerging economies, transition to clean energy products such as liquefied natural gas and hydrogen, growth in demand for cryogenic gases and electric vehicle charging, consolidation in the convenience retail sector, increased digitization of convenience stores and fuel retailing, as well as secular growth in automated vehicle wash systems and solutions (over manual and do-it-yourself washing). \n•\nOur Imaging & Identification segment leverages its unique product offering containing equipment, consumables, software and services to address market needs and requirements, including increased regulation for supply chain transparency in fast moving consumer goods, adoption of more stringent food safety regulations in emerging economies, and growing demand for product traceability and brand protection. \n•\nOur Pumps & Process Solutions segment is focused on capturing growth in its installed base, in biological drug production and the shift toward single-use manufacturing processes. The segment's offerings address the increased demand for liquid cooling requirements for certain electronics (including in data center infrastructure), and investment in midstream energy and power generation infrastructure (including growing sophistication of fluid transfer and rotating machinery components, instrumentation, and digital controls). We also support virgin, recycled plastics, and polymers production and energy transition investments into wind power, hydrogen compression and carbon capture. \n•\nOur Climate & Sustainability Technologies segment is responding to our customers' demand for increased energy efficiency and sustainability in food retail merchandising solutions, including refrigeration systems using CO\n2 \nrefrigerant, as well as increasing demand for sustainable heating and cooling solutions, including heat pumps, and sustainability-driven growing global demand for aluminum beverage cans.\nWe aim to capture growth by making organic investments in capacity expansion, automation and productivity improvement, research and development, developing new products and technologies, improving digital capabilities and expanding our geographic coverage. We pursue a disciplined and strategic approach to acquisitions aiming to enhance the quality and attractiveness of our portfolio over time and position Dover for long-term growth. We evaluate acquisition opportunities across the portfolio where we see the greatest runway for value-creating inorganic capital deployment. We continually evaluate how our assets and capabilities can position us to grow in markets adjacent to our core businesses (for example, new applications, geographies, product segments or adjacent technologies) where we can be advantaged.\nIn addition to product innovation, we aim to capture growth by developing digital technologies. Our Boston-based Dover Digital Labs serves as the company-wide hub for our digital initiative. We have continued to invest in this facility and our team of software developers, data scientists, and product managers to enhance our digital capabilities. The Digital Labs team is driving digital transformation across our businesses in four areas: (i) enhancing the customer experience through more efficient and streamlined digital customer interfaces that make it easy to do business with Dover companies; (ii) developing and improving acquired and organically built connected and software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") products, that combine sensors, software, machine learning and artificial intelligence; (iii) driving increased efficiency, safety and quality in our manufacturing operations by employing cutting-edge automation through \"connected factory\" and \"data quality\" programs; and (iv) ensuring security of digital products. Many of our software solutions in the areas of product traceability, anti-counterfeiting, retail fueling station monitoring, vehicle damage analysis and measurement systems, and visual commerce have been certified as compliant under AICPA System and Organization Controls 2 (\"SOC 2\") audits. We believe the Digital Labs’ contributions in these areas enable us to add significant value to our products and to capture commercial growth opportunities. By leveraging a central resource for Commercial Excellence, Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet of Things (\"IIoT\") and our software products, we are able to capture efficiencies in our digital transformation efforts, improve product \n7    \nTable of Contents\nsecurity, and offer better efficiency in providing support and engineering for our software and connected products to keep our projects cost-competitive.\nImproving profitability and return on invested capital\nWe are committed to generating sustainable returns on invested capital well above the cost of capital across all of our businesses. We continually evaluate and pursue opportunities to improve efficiency, margin and return on capital. We are intensely foc\nused on driving operational excellence across our businesses. We have implemented numerous productivity initiatives to maximize our efficiency, such as supply chain integration, shared services, lean manufacturing principles and production automation, footprint optimization, and product complexity reduction, as well as workplace safety initiatives to help ensure the health and welfare of our employees. Our businesses place a strong emphasis on continual product quality improvement and new product development to better serve customers and to facilitate expansion into new products and geographic markets. \nWe also focus on margin expansion initiatives designed to reduce our selling, general and administrative cost base and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain operations across the portfolio. We continually expand initiatives to extract productivity gains across the businesses and realize savings. Our margin expansion initiatives are focused on four core enterprise capabilities: (1) leverage our Digital Labs team to enhance our internal and market-facing digital capabilities, (2) improve utilization and optimization of our manufacturing footprint through centralized resources and investment, (3) further centralize shared services under Dover Business Services, and (4) invest in our India Innovation Center shared services.\nDover Digital\n.\n \nOur Dover Digital Labs consists of a team of approximately 150 software developers, data scientists, manufacturing engineers and product managers who provide digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience, develop connected industrial products and artificial intelligence based models that are embedded in SaaS offerings provided to customers by our operating companies, drive automation and efficiency inside our factories through digital technologies and in our business processes and focus on the security of our digital products. Our Dover Digital Labs team has built common platforms which are being deployed on customer facing applications to make it easier to discover, find, configure, buy and obtain products and services from Dover companies, thereby optimizing our sales and support staff resources, driving pricing discipline, enabling reduction of product complexity and improving management of working capital. Our digital team has also deployed shared IIoT capability such that many of Dover's products are remotely configurable and monitored, enabling our businesses to sell aftermarket parts and offer remote diagnostic services. \nDover Operational Excellence\n. Our corporate team is composed of functional experts in operational optimization, lean manufacturing, automation, Environment, Health and Safety (\"EHS\") and complex project management. This team works closely with our businesses to drive excellence in our manufacturing and supply chain processes, standards and measurement tools to identify, prioritize and monitor execution of operational improvement initiatives. We continue to focus on initiatives to improve operational performance and the continuous improvement programs embedded in our businesses' day-to-day operations.\nDover Business Services\n. We continue to invest in Dover Business Services shared service centers, consisting of a team of approximately 700 professionals, to provide important transactional and value-added services to our businesses. Our shared service model allows us to leverage scale across Dover, increase process efficiencies through technology and specialization, and reduce risk through centralized controls. Our shared service centers create value by freeing resources within our businesses that would otherwise be dedicated to transactional services and allowing them to focus on customers, markets and product excellence. We expect to continue driving efficiencies through Dover Business Services as we increase the level of service centralization across the portfolio.\nIndia Innovation Center\n. Our India Innovation Center has a team of approximately 800 engineers and IT professionals that our businesses rely on to leverage for product engineering, digital solutions development, data and information management, research and development and intellectual property services. The scale of this team allows our businesses to access resources with capabilities and expertise across many disciplines that would be more costly to them as stand-alone companies, and allows for concurrent engineering on time sensitive projects.\n \n8    \nTable of Contents\nWe have been steadily investing in the build out and deployment of the above four enterprise capabilities in the past several years, including organically investing and expanding the staff of experts and support personnel in key centers of excellence globally.\nDisciplined capital allocation and continuous portfolio enhancement \nWe are focused on the most efficient allocation of capital to maximize returns on investment. To do this, we utilize organic reinvestment to grow and strengthen our existing businesses. We plan to make average annual investments in capital spending of approximately 2% of revenue with a focus on internal projects designed to expand our market participation and manufacturing capacity, drive further adoption of e-commerce and digital capabilities, and improve productivity. In addition, we seek to deploy capital for acquisitions in attractive growth areas across our portfolio. Dover focuses primarily on bolt-on acquisitions, applying strict selection criteria of market attractiveness (including growth, market landscape, and performance-based competition), business fit (including sustained leading position, revenue visibility, and favorable customer value-add versus switching cost or risk) and financial return profile (including accretive growth and margins and double-digit return on invested capital). We opportunistically divest businesses where we see limited runway for future value creation relative to our aspirations, or where market and business fundamentals change and no longer suit our criteria of business attractiveness and portfolio fit. Finally, we have consistently returned cash to shareholders by paying dividends, which have increased annually over each of the last 69 years. We undertake opportunistic share repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy. We employ a prudent financial policy to support our capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining an investment grade credit rating. \nPortfolio Development \nAcquisitions\n \nOur acquisition strategy aims to enhance our existing portfolio through value creating acquisitions within our priority growth platforms, with a focus on increasing our exposure to high organic growth and margin accretive businesses with significant synergy potential. We seek to acquire complementary add-on businesses with a strong fit with our existing platforms, increasing their reach and customer access, broadening their product mix, providing exposure to attractive end market adjacencies, or enhancing technological capabilities and customer value-add. With all our acquisitions, we seek businesses that are leaders in their respective markets or niches, have a strong track record for innovation, offer differentiated solutions, and have attractive and sustainable returns with significant synergy potential. We aim to generate double-digit return on capital within three or four years after an acquisition is completed.\nOver the past three years (2022 through 2024), we have spent approximately $1.5 billion, net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration, to purchase thirteen businesses. For more details, see Note 3 — Acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \nOur future growth depends in large part on finding and acquiring successful businesses that expand the scope of our offerings and make us an even more important supplier to our customers. While we expect to generate annual organic revenue growth above that of gross domestic product (4% to 6% annually on average) over a long-term business cycle absent extraordinary adverse economic conditions, our success in consistently growing the portfolio is also dependent on the ability to acquire and integrate businesses within our existing structure. To track post-merger integration and accountability, we utilize an internal scorecard and well-defined processes to help ensure expected synergies are realized and value is created.\nDispositions\n \nFrom time to time, we have sold or divested some of our businesses based on changes in specific market outlook, structural changes in financial performance, value-creation potential, or for other strategic considerations, which include an effort to reduce our exposure to cyclical and capital intensive markets and, therefore, focus on our higher margin and higher growth spaces.\nGoing forward, we recognize that some businesses in Dover's portfolio may have a greater value-creation potential if owned by another parent with a larger presence and focus on a given niche. We pragmatically consider such opportunities as part of our ongoing portfolio management and review processes, and execute divestitures if the value created by the divestiture is \n9    \nTable of Contents\ndetermined to be at an appropriate premium to the value of such business to Dover and the divestitures allow Dover shareholders to participate in the future value-creation potential from a change in ownership, including through the redeployment of divestiture proceeds into attractive add-on businesses in higher priority end-markets or through opportunistic return of capital to shareholders. \nDuring 2022 and 2023, there were no material dispositions. \nOn March 31, 2024, the Company completed the sale of the De-Sta-Co business, an operating company within the Engineered Products segment, for total consideration, net of cash transferred, of $675.9 million. The sale did not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation, as it did not represent a strategic shift that would have a major effect on operations and financial results. \nOn October 8, 2024, the Company completed the sale of the ESG business, an operating company within the Engineered Products segment, for total consideration, net of cash transferred, of $2.0 billion, subject to standard working capital adjustments. As the disposal represented a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, the sale met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation. For more details, see Note 4 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Segments \nAs noted previously, Dover's five segments are structured around businesses with similar business models, go-to-market strategies and manufacturing practices and product categories which increases management efficiency and better aligns Dover's operations with its strategic initiatives and capital allocation priorities, and provides greater transparency about performance to external stakeholders. Dover's five operating and reportable segments are as follows: Engineered Products, Clean Energy & Fueling, Imaging & Identification, Pumps & Process Solutions and Climate & Sustainability Technologies. For financial information about our segments and geographic areas, see Note 19 — Segment Information in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \nEngineered Products\nOur Engineered Products segment provides a wide range of equipment, components, software, solutions and services that have broad customer applications across a number of markets, including: aftermarket vehicle service, aerospace and defense, industrial winch and hoist, and fluid dispensing.

As a result, the loss of any single supplier has not had, and is not likely to have, a material impact on operating profits at the consolidated level. While the required raw materials are generally available, commodity pricing can be volatile, particularly for various grades of steel, copper, aluminum and select other commodities. Although cost increases in commodities may be recovered through increased prices to customers, our operating results are exposed to such fluctuations. We attempt to control such costs through index-based contracts with suppliers and customers and various other programs, such as our global supply chain activities. \nMarkets for multiple raw materials saw significant volatility and supply chain disruptions throughout 2021 into 2023. Although most commodity and logistics costs have returned to historical norms, volatility is still a risk due to economic uncertainties and supply side dynamics. These situations could still negatively impact profitability of some businesses as we were required to seek alternative sources of supply at higher costs or interrupt our normal manufacturing process flow leading to less efficient output and cost.\nResearch and Development \nOur businesses invest to develop innovative new products, as well as to upgrade and improve existing products, to satisfy customer needs, including demand for energy-efficient products designed to help customers meet sustainability goals, expand revenue opportunities geographically, maintain or extend competitive advantages, improve product reliability and reduce production costs.\nOur Imaging & Identification segment expends significant effort in research and development because the rate of product development by their customers is often quite high. Our businesses that develop product identification, printing equipment and software solutions believe their customers expect a continuing rate of product innovation, performance improvement and reduction in total cost of ownership. The result has been downward pricing trends that can only be mitigated with the continuous introduction of innovative product solutions in a market where product life cycles generally average less than seven years.\nOur \nClean Energy & Fueling\n segment invests in research and development to advance innovative traditional and alternative fuel dispensing equipment and components, payment platforms, fuel site asset management and connectivity solutions, IIoT-enabled cloud-based connected solutions for retail and commercial fleet fueling settings, components for high-criticality cryogenic gas storage and transportation applications, including hydrogen and liquefied natural gas. These technology investments align with our customer's needs and our commitment to delivering to our customers opportunities for operational cost reductions, increased sales, and an enhanced customer experience for their customers through a combination of intelligent fueling and retail solutions.\nOur Pumps & Process Solutions segment invests in research and development for new product introduction and custom solutions to drive volume and share in both existing markets and newer/faster growth markets – such as single-use biopharmaceutical manufacturing and liquid cooling of high performance electronics. These investments will allow us to take advantage of existing growth trends such as in cell and gene therapy applications, and data center cooling applications supporting investments in artificial intelligence.\nMany of our businesses are also involved in important product improvement initiatives. These businesses concentrate on working closely with customers on specific applications, expanding product lines and market applications and continuously improving manufacturing processes. Some of these businesses experience a much more rapid rate of change requiring higher product development capability and new product introduction.\nSimilarly, our businesses invest in research and development to pursue digital strategies based on customer needs and leverage the capabilities of the Dover Digital Labs to deliver on those digital strategies. For example, OPW, an operating company within the Clean Energy & Fueling segment, announced the launch of its RegO Presto-Link\n© \ndevice and RegO application integration during 2024. This application streamlines testing processes and enhances safety measures for on-site personnel performing the liquefied petroleum gas container and regulator testing. The RegO application is integrated with the Presto-Link Bluetooth device, which communicates with RegO Presto-Tap products placed on propane-system components \n12    \nTable of Contents\nrequiring testing. This connection enables swift and precise leak detection and pressure readings, eliminating the need for manual recording of results and mitigating the risks associated with human error.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur employees are our most valuable asset and are critical to our ability to deliver on our strategic plans. Our success in delivering high quality and innovative products and solutions for our customers and driving operational excellence is only achievable through the talent, expertise, and dedication of our global team. We had approximately 24,000 employees worldwide as of\n \nDecember 31, 2024. \nAttraction, Development, and Retention\nWe recognize that attracting, developing and retaining skilled talent and promoting a work environment that is professional and inclusive are essential to maintaining our leadership positions in the markets we serve. While our operating companies are the hubs of these activities — an effective model that puts ownership in the businesses and cultures that are the source of opportunities for employees — we are increasingly leveraging the corporate center to drive talent recruitment and development and consistent human capital management practices across our businesses. This center-led focus is enabling us to make development opportunities available across our enterprise which we believe promotes employee advancement, engagement and retention. We offer employees resources to continuously improve their skills and performance with the goal of further cultivating entrepreneurial talent with a range of perspectives, backgrounds, skills, and experiences inside our global businesses to fill key positions. We seek people who are proactive and dedicated, demonstrate an ownership mindset and share our commitment to the pursuit of operational excellence. We continue to make significant investments in talent development and recognize that the growth and development of our employees is essential for our continued success.\nWorkplace Environment and Inclusion\nAs noted above, we are committed to maintaining a work environment that is professional, inclusive, and free from discrimination and harassment. That includes ensuring equal opportunity in our hiring practices and in our treatment of employees regardless of their race, color, religion, disability, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, marital status, family responsibility, age, or other characteristic protected by law. Our Code of Conduct lays out guidelines to maintain a fair and safe workplace.\nWe strive to build teams that fully leverage individuals’ capabilities and the breadth of skills, perspectives and experiences represented in our workforce. We believe this motivates our employees to be engaged and productive, enables us to attract new talent, helps us effectively serve our customers, and advances innovation from ideas contributed as a result of the variety of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of our employees. To that end, we partner with human resources and leadership teams across our portfolio of companies on talent outreach action plans to identify and recruit qualified candidates with a variety of backgrounds, skills, and experiences.  We aim to cultivate an inclusive culture that enables employees to feel connected to our business objectives and valued for their contributions.\nHealth and Safety\nWe are committed to achieving our vision of a zero-harm workplace and continue to prioritize health and safety compliance, risk mitigation, and process improvement across the organization. We utilize a global EHS information management system designed to measure and track key metrics and actions pertinent to our health and safety programs. This software supports our strategy to proactively reduce hazards thereby further enhancing shop floor safety. Through our efforts, we have reduced our total recordable injury rate substantially since 2019.\n13    \nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital Investments Related to Strategic Priorities\nIn line with our strategic priorities, we have additionally invested in the following aspects of human capital resource management, among other areas:\n•\nDover Digital Labs – We are continuing to leverage our Digital Labs team to improve our digital capabilities. Our team of software developers, data scientists, manufacturing engineers, and product managers drive digital transformation across our businesses by enhancing customer experience, developing connected industrial products, enabling digital manufacturing and securing our digital products.\n•\nOperational management – Our operations teams, including our management team at the corporate center, focuses on improving operational efficiency, such as implementing production automation.\n•\nShared services – We are continuing to further centralize shared services under Dover Business Services and our India Innovation Center. Our shared services capabilities include a wide range of functional areas including transactional support, human resources, IT, finance and accounting, engineering and product development. These services enable increased productivity and growth as well as free up resources within our operating companies to focus on customers, markets and product development.\nIntellectual Property and Intangible Assets \nOur businesses own many patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property, which have been created, registered or acquired over a number of years and, to the extent relevant, expire at various times over a number of years. A large portion of our businesses' intellectual property consists of patents, unpatented technology and proprietary information constituting trade secrets that we seek to protect in various ways, including confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers where appropriate. In addition, a significant portion of our intangible assets relate to customer relationships. While our intellectual property and customer relationships are important to our success, the loss or expiration of any of these rights or relationships is not likely to materially affect our results on a consolidated basis. We believe that our commitment to continuous engineering improvements, new product development and improved manufacturing techniques, as well as strong sales, marketing and service efforts, are significant to our general leadership positions in the niche markets we serve.\nCustomers \nWe serve thousands of customers, none of which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2024. Given our diversity of served markets, customer concentrations are not significant. Businesses supplying the defense and commercial refrigeration industries tend to deal with a few large customers that are significant within those industries. This also tends to be true for businesses supplying the power generation and chemical industries. In the other markets served, there is usually a much lower concentration of customers, particularly where our companies provide a substantial number of products and services applicable to a broad range of end-use applications. \nSeasonality \nIn general, while our businesses are not highly seasonal, we do tend to have stronger revenue generation in the second half of the year, which is driven by customer capital expenditure timing and seasonal activity patterns in our end-markets. Our businesses serving the retail fueling market tend to increase in the second half of the year based on the historical purchasing patterns of their customers. Our businesses serving the major equipment markets, such as power generation, chemical and processing industries, have longer lead times geared to seasonal, commercial, or consumer demands and customers in these markets tend to delay or accelerate product ordering and delivery to coincide with those market trends which moderates the aforementioned seasonality patterns. Our food retail refrigeration business tends to face higher levels of demand in the second and third quarters as retailers avoid construction and remodeling activity during fall/winter holidays.\n14    \nTable of Contents\nCompetition\n \nOur competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of our products manufactured and the markets served. In general, most of our businesses are market leaders that compete with only a few companies, and the key competitive factors are customer service, product quality, price and innovation.

We believe that sustainability-driven innovation in response to customer demand helps us contribute positively to enhanced resource efficiency and waste reduction while presenting a valuable growth opportunity. Aligned with this commitment, in 2021, we announced science-based targets to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. These targets include an absolute reduction of scope 1 and scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions of 30 percent by 2030, from a 2019 baseline year, and an absolute reduction of scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions of 15 percent by 2030, from a 2019 baseline year.\nWe highlight key initiatives and performance metrics about our sustainability activities under the \"Sustainability\" tab on our website, www.dovercorporation.com. \nOther Matters\nOur operations are governed by a variety of international, national, state and local environmental laws. We are committed to continued compliance and believe our operations generally are in substantial compliance with these laws. In a few instances, particular plants and businesses have been the subject of administrative and legal proceedings with governmental agencies or private parties relating to the discharge or potential discharge of regulated substances. Where necessary, these matters have been addressed with specific consent orders to achieve compliance. \nThere have been no material effects upon our earnings and competitive position resulting from our compliance with laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment. We are aware of a number of existing or upcoming regulatory initiatives intended to reduce emissions in geographies where our manufacturing and warehouse/distribution facilities are located and have evaluated the potential impact of these regulations on our businesses. We anticipate that direct impacts from regulatory actions will not be significant in the short- to medium-term. We expect the regulatory impacts associated with climate change regulation would be primarily indirect and would result in \"pass-through\" costs from energy suppliers, suppliers of raw materials and other services related to our operations. \nOther Information \nWe make available free of charge through the \"Investor Information\" link on our website, www.dovercorporation.com, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to these reports. We post each of these reports on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after the report is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and Notes included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" and in the \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" preceding Part I of this Form 10-K.\nThroughout this MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). Please see \"Non-GAAP Disclosures\" at the end of this Item 7 for further detail on these financial measures. We believe these measures provide investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends. Reconciliations within this MD&A provide more details on the use and derivation of these measures.\nOVERVIEW\nDover Corporation is a diversified global manufacturer and solutions provider delivering innovative equipment and components, consumable supplies, aftermarket parts, software and digital solutions and support services. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, consolidated revenue was $7.7 billion, an increase of $61.4 million or 0.8%, as compared to the prior year. The increase is driven by acquisition-related growth of 3.0%, partially offset by a disposition-related decline of 2.0% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.2%. The results were driven by acquisitions, solid demand across most end markets and strategic pricing initiatives.\nOrganic revenue remained flat due to increases of 8.2%, 2.6%, 2.4%, and 1.4% in our Engineered Products, Clean Energy & Fueling, Imaging & Identification, and Pumps & Process Solutions segments, respectively, offset by the Climate & Sustainability Technologies segment which declined 11.2%. For further information, see \"Segment Results of Operations\" within this Item 7.\nFrom a geographic perspective, organic revenue for the U.S., our largest market, grew 3.8% as compared to the prior year, driven by broad-based growth primarily in our Engineered Products and Clean Energy & Fueling segments. Revenue in Asia and Europe declined 7.1% and 3.1%, respectively, while revenue in Other Americas grew 5.6%. All other geographic markets declined 17.4% organically year over year. \nBookings increased 7.3% over the prior year to $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. This included organic bookings growth of 6.5% and acquisition-related growth of 3.2%, partially offset by a disposition-related decline of 2.1% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.3%. \nRestructuring and other costs of $85.0 million included restructuring charges of $69.8 million and other costs of $15.2 million. Restructuring and other costs were primarily related to headcount reductions and product line and other exit costs in the Clean Energy & Fueling and Climate & Sustainability Technologies segments. Other costs (benefits) were primarily due to non-cash asset impairment charges and reorganization costs in the Climate & Sustainability Technologies and Imaging & Identification segments, respectively. For further discussion related to our restructuring and other costs, see \"Restructuring and Other Costs (Benefits),\" within this Item 7.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company completed eight business acquisitions for approx\nimately $674.0 million, net of cash acquired and inclusive of measurement period adjustments and contingent consideration. See Note 3 — Acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details regarding the businesses acquired during the year.\n29    \nTable of Contents\n \nOn March 31, 2024, the Company completed the sale of the De-Sta-Co business, an operating company within the Engineered Products segment, for total consideration, net of cash transferred of $675.9 million. This sale resulted in a pre-tax gain on disposition of $530.3 million, included within the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 4 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details. \nOn September 30, 2024, a minority owned equity method investment held within the Climate & Sustainability Technologies segment was sold and the Company received its proportionate share of the proceeds amounting to $93.0 million. The sale resulted in a preliminary pre-tax gain of $67.4 million, included within the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 4 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details. \nOn October 8, 2024, the Company completed the sale of the Environmental Solutions Group (\"ESG\") business, an operating company within the Engineered Products segment, for total consideration, net of cash transferred, of $2.0 billion. This sale resulted in a preliminary pre-tax gain on disposition of $1.6 billion, included within earnings from discontinued operations, net in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. For all periods presented, the results of ESG prior to the sale are classified as discontinued operations as the disposal represented a strategic shift with a major impact on our operations and financial results. See Note 4 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details. The discussion within this MD&A, unless otherwise noted, relates solely to our continuing operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company received a total of 2,869,282 shares upon completion of a $500 million accelerated repurchase program (the \"ASR Program\"). The total number of shares ultimately repurchased under the ASR Program was based on the volume-weighted average share price of Dover's common stock during the calculation period of the accelerated share repurchase program, less a discount, which was $174.26 over the term of the ASR Program. During the year ended December 31, 2024, exclusive of the ASR Program, there were no share repurchases. \nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n \n \nYears Ended December 31,\n% / Point Change\n(dollars in thousands, except per share figures)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nRevenue\n$\n7,745,909\n$\n7,684,476\n$\n7,844,174\n0.8 \n%\n(2.0)\n%\nCost of goods and services\n4,787,288\n4,816,932\n4,939,221\n(0.6)\n%\n(2.5)\n%\nGross profit\n2,958,621\n2,867,544\n2,904,953\n3.2 \n%\n(1.3)\n%\nGross profit margin\n38.2 \n%\n37.3 \n%\n37.0 \n%\n0.90 \n0.30 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n1,752,266\n1,648,204\n1,625,312\n6.3 \n%\n1.4 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue\n22.6 \n%\n21.4 \n%\n20.7 \n%\n1.20 \n0.70 \nOperating earnings\n1,206,355\n1,219,340\n1,279,641\n(1.1)\n%\n(4.7)\n%\nInterest expense\n131,171\n131,304\n116,456\n(0.1)\n%\n12.7 \n%\nInterest income\n(37,158)\n(13,496)\n(4,429)\n175.3 \n%\n204.7 \n%\nGain on dispositions\n(597,798)\n—\n—\nnm*\nnm*\nOther income, net\n(46,876)\n(21,468)\n(22,589)\n118.4 \n%\n(5.0)\n%\nEarnings before provision for income taxes \n1,757,016\n1,123,000\n1,190,203\n56.5 \n%\n(5.6)\n%\nProvision for income taxes\n357,048\n179,136\n200,291\n99.3 \n%\n(10.6)\n%\nEffective tax rate\n20.3 \n%\n16.0 \n%\n16.8 \n%\n4.30 \n(0.8)\nEarnings from continuing operations\n1,399,968\n943,864\n989,912\n48.3 \n%\n(4.7)\n%\nEarnings from discontinued operations, net\n1,297,158\n112,964\n75,464\nnm*\nnm*\nNet earnings\n$\n2,697,126\n$\n1,056,828\n$\n1,065,376\n155.2 \n%\n(0.8)\n%\nEarnings per common share from continuing operations - diluted\n$\n10.09 \n$\n6.71 \n$\n6.89 \n50.4 \n%\n(2.6)\n%\n *nm: not meaningful\n \n30    \nTable of Contents\n \nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $61.4 million, or 0.8% to $7.7 billion compared with 2023. Organic revenue remained flat as pricing actions and broad-based demand across most of the portfolio were offset by lower shipments of beverage can-making equipment, polymer processing equipment, and European heat exchangers. The increase in revenue was driven by acquisition-related growth of 3.0% primarily in our Clean Energy & Fueling and Pumps & Process Solutions segments, partially offset by a disposition-related decline of 2.0% in our Engineered Products segment and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.2%. Customer pricing favorably impacted revenue in 2024 by approximately 1.6% and by 3.8% in the prior year.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased $159.7 million, or 2.0% to $7.7 billion compared with 2022. Organic revenue decline of 2.8% was primarily due to general reduction in our customers' and distribution channels' inventory levels that resulted from lead time normalization and higher inventory carrying costs driven by interest rate increases. Acquisition-related growth increased by 1.0% primarily driven by our Pumps & Process Solutions segment, offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0.2%. Customer pricing favorably impacted revenue in 2023 by approximately 3.8% and by 6.7% in the prior year.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased $91.1 million, or 3.2%, to $3.0 billion compared with 2023, primarily driven by positive product mix, pricing and productivity actions. Gross profit margin increased 90 basis points to 38.2% as compared to the prior year driven by benefits from mix, pricing, price versus cost dynamics and productivity initiatives, partially offset by inflationary headwinds, acquisition integration costs and lower volumes across some of the Company's businesses.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased $37.4 million, or 1.3%, to $2.9 billion compared with 2022, primarily due to lower volumes across some end markets, partially offset by positive market conditions in certain secular growth-exposed businesses, as well as pricing, productivity initiatives and restructuring actions. Gross profit margin increased 30 basis points to 37.3% as compared to the prior year driven by benefits from pricing, productivity and restructuring actions, partially offset by lower volumes across some of the Company's businesses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $104.1 million, or 6.3% to $1.8 billion compared with 2023, primarily driven by increased employee compensation and benefits and acquisition-related amortization. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 120 basis points to 22.6%, reflecting an increase in expense which exceeded the increase in the revenue base.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $22.9 million, or 1.4% to $1.6 billion compared with 2022, primarily driven by increased restructuring, employee compensation and benefits and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, partially offset by lower contract labor costs. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 70 basis points to 21.4%, reflecting a decrease in the revenue base.\nResearch and development costs, including qualifying engineering costs, are expensed when incurred and amounted to $149.6 million, $139.1 million and $151.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These costs as a percent of revenue were 1.9%, 1.8% and 1.9% for the years December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNon-Operating Items\nInterest Expense, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, interest expense, net of interest income, decreased $23.8 million, or 20.2%, to $94.0 million compared with 2023 primarily due to interest income generated by the proceeds from the sale of ESG held in highly liquid short-term investments.\n31    \nTable of Contents\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, interest expense, net of interest income, increased $5.8 million, or 5.2%, to $117.8 million compared with 2022 primarily driven by increased higher average interest rates since the prior year, partially offset by decreased commercial paper borrowings.\nGain on Dispositions\nGain on dispositions of $597.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 was driven by the sale of the De-Sta-Co business on March 31, 2024, and the sale of a minority owned equity method investment on September 30, 2024. See Note 4 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details.\nThere were no significant dispositions in the years ended 2023 and 2022.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net includes non-service pension benefit, deferred compensation plan investments gain or loss, earnings or charges from equity method investments, foreign exchange gain or loss, and various other items. Other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $46.9 million, $21.5 million and $22.6 million, respectively. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, other income increased compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased non-service pension benefit and increased deferred compensation plan investment gain. For the year ended December 31, 2023, other income decreased compared to 2022 due to the decrease in non-service pension benefit, partially offset by increased non-operational income and increased earnings from our equity method investments.   \nIncome Taxes\nOur businesses have a global presence with 35.8%, 45.8% 46.7% of our pre-tax earnings in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, generated in foreign jurisdictions. Foreign earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that differ from the 21.0% U.S. statutory tax rate. \nOur effective tax rate was 20.3% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 16.0% and 16.8% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The 2024 tax rate was primarily driven by gains on dispositions. The 2023 rate was primarily driven by the release of a valuation allowance against non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards mainly related to an internal reorganization, partially offset by accrual of withholding taxes on current and future repatriation of certain foreign earnings.The 2022 rate was primarily driven by favorable audit resolutions, including a reduction to income taxes previously recorded related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. \nThe Company is continuing to monitor the changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. We do not expect this to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.\nSee Note 14 — Income Taxes in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details.\nEarnings from Continuing Operations \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, earnings from continuing operations increased $456.1 million, or 48.3%, to $1.4 billion, or $10.09 per diluted share, compared with earnings from continuing operations of $943.9 million, or $6.71 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Earnings from continuing operations increased primarily from gain on dispositions, pricing actions and benefits from productivity initiatives, partially offset by lower volumes across some of the Company's businesses, and increased selling, general and administrative expenses.\n32    \nTable of Contents\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, earnings from continuing operations decreased $46.0 million, or 4.7% to $943.9 million or $6.71 per diluted share compared with earnings from continuing operations of $989.9 million or $6.89 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Earnings from continuing operations decreased primarily due to lower volumes across some of the Company's businesses and increased selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by customer \npricing actions and benefits from productivity initiatives\n.\nDiscontinued Operations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the historical results of ESG were presented as discontinued operations as the sale represented a strategic shift that will have a major impact on our operations and financials results.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 earnings from discontinued operations, net were $1.3 billion, $113.0 million and $75.5 million respectively. Refer to Note 4 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in Item 8 of this form 10-K for additional information on discontinued and disposed operations.\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nThe summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our five reportable operating segments (Engineered Products, Clean Energy & Fueling, Imaging & Identification, Pumps & Process Solutions and Climate & Sustainability Technologies). Each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple markets. We evaluate our operating segment performance based on segment earnings as defined in Note 19 — Segment Information in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \nAdditionally, we use the following operational metrics in monitoring the performance of the business. We believe the operational metrics are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in assessing the performance of our segments:\n•\nBookings represent total orders received from customers in the current reporting period and exclude de-bookings related to orders received in prior periods, if any. This metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of revenue order trends. \n•\nOrganic bookings represent bookings excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions. This metric is an important measure of performance and an indicator of revenue order trends.\n•\nBook-to-bill is a ratio of the amount of bookings received from customers during a period divided by the amount of revenue recorded during that same period.

Significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchase of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. We generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for upcoming debt maturities and for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table is derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows:\n \nYears Ended December 31,\nCash Flows from Operations\n \n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash flows provided by (used in):\n \n \nOperating activities\n$\n1,087,833 \n$\n1,219,546 \n$\n746,754 \nInvesting activities\n(26,983)\n(717,715)\n(520,844)\nFinancing activities\n(1,271,673)\n(568,056)\n(260,265)\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased by $131.7 million compared to 2023. This decrease was primarily due to tax payments of $103.4 million and $20.4 million related to gains from the sales of De-Sta-Co and a minority owned equity method investment, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2024. Cash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $472.8 million compared to 2022. This increase was primarily driven by improvements in the management of working capital.\nAdjusted Working Capital: \nWe believe adjusted working capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) provides a meaningful measure of liquidity by showing changes caused by operational results. The following table provides a calculation of adjusted working capital: \nAdjusted Working Capital \n(\nin thousands)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nReceivables, net\n$\n1,354,225 \n$\n1,321,107 \nInventories, net\n1,144,838 \n1,144,089 \nLess: Accounts payable\n848,006 \n854,465 \nAdjusted working capital\n$\n1,651,057 \n$\n1,610,731 \nAdjusted working capital increased by $40.3 million, or 2.5%, to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2024, which reflected an increase in accounts receivable of $33.1 million, an increase in inventory of $0.7 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $6.5 million. \nThese amounts include the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency translation.\n \nThe increase in adjusted working capital versus year-end 2023 is primarily a result of collections timing driving higher year-end accounts receivable balances.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flow from investing activities is derived from cash inflows from proceeds from dispositions, offset by cash outflows for acquisitions and capital expenditures. The majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following:\n•\nProceeds from dispositions\n: In 2024, we received net proceeds of $768.8 million from the sales of De-Sta-Co, an operating company within the Engineered Products segment, and a minority owned equity method investment within Climate & Sustainability Technologies segment. See Note 4 — Discontinued and Disposed Operations in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n43    \nTable of Contents\n \n•\nAcquisitions: \nIn 2024, we deployed $635.3 million, net of cash acquired to acquire eight businesses. In comparison, we acquired two businesses in 2023 for total consideration of $533.6 million, net of cash acquired. Total acquisition spend in 2022 was $312.9 million, net of cash acquired and was comprised of three businesses. See Note 3 — Acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n•\nCapital spending:\n Capital expenditures, primarily to support growth initiatives, productivity and new product launches, were $167.5 million in 2024, $183.4 million in 2023, and $211.1 million in 2022. Our capital expenditures decreased $15.9 million and $27.7 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, in line with our planned expenditures for the years. \nWe anticipate that capital expenditures and any additional acquisitions we make in 2025 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, or by accessing the public debt or equity markets. We estimate capital expenditures in 2025 to range from $170.0 million to $190.0 million. \nFinancing Activities\nCash flow from financing activities generally relat\nes to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity. The majority of financing activity was attributed to the following:\n•\nRepurchase of common stock, including accelerated share repurchase program: \nDuring 2024, the Company received a total of 2,869,282 shares upon completion of the 2024 ASR Program for $500.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased no shares. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company received a total of 3,892,295 shares upon completion of the 2022 ASR Program for $500.0 million, and exclusive of the 2022 ASR Program, repurchased 641,428 shares of common stock at a total cost of $85.0 million.\n•\nCommercial paper and other short-term borrowings, net:\n \nDuring 2024 and 2023, we used $467.6 million and $267.5 million, respectively, to pay off primarily commercial paper borrowings. During 2022, we received net proceeds of $629.9 million from commercial paper and other short-term borrowings used to partially fund our accelerated share repurchase transaction and the acquisition of Malema.\n•\nDividend payments:\n Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $283.1 million in 2024, $284.3 million in 2023 and $287.6 million 2022. Our dividends paid per common share increased 1% to $2.05 per share in 2024 compared to $2.03 per share in 2023. The number of common shares outstanding decreased from 2023 to 2024, as share repurchases exceeded share issuances.\nCash Flows from Discontinued Operations\nCash flows from discontinued operations generated $1.6 billion, $107.9 million and $38.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and represents the results of ESG during the periods presented. The cash flows from discontinued operations generated for 2024 primarily relate to cash provided by investing activities of $2.0 billion, which is comprised primarily of proceeds from the sale of ESG and partially offset by cash used by operating activities of $339.5 million, comprised of $439.9 million in tax payments made related to the gain on disposition, partially offset by cash flows from ESG's operating results. Cash flows generated for 2023 primarily relate to cash provided by operating activities of $116.8 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $8.9 million. Cash flows generated for 2022 primarily relate to cash provided by operations of $59.0 million, partially offset by cash paid for an asset acquisition of $10.2 million and capital expenditures of $9.9 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows, we also measure free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) which represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue equals free cash flow divided by revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations equals free \n44    \nTable of Contents\n \ncash flow divided by earnings from continuing operations. We believe that free cash flow is an important measure of liquidity because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that may be available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities, such as funding acquisitions, paying dividends, repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock.\nThe following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities:\n \nYears Ended December 31,\nFree Cash Flow\n \n(dollars in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash flow provided by operating activities\n$\n1,087,833 \n$\n1,219,546 \n$\n746,754 \nLess: Capital expenditures\n(167,533)\n(183,406)\n(211,082)\nFree cash flow\n$\n920,300 \n$\n1,036,140 \n$\n535,672 \nCash flow from operating activities as a percentage of revenue\n14.0 %\n15.9 %\n9.5 %\nCash flow from operating activities as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations\n77.7 %\n129.2 %\n75.4 %\nFree cash flow as a percentage of revenue\n11.9 %\n13.5 %\n6.8 %\nFree cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations\n65.7 %\n109.8 %\n54.1 %\n \nFree cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased by $115.8 million compared to 2023 primarily due to tax payments made for the gain on sale of De-Sta-Co and a minority owned equity method investment totaling $123.8 million, partially offset by lower capital expenditures. The decreases in cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow as percentages of earnings from continuing operations are primarily due to the gain on sale of De-Sta-Co and a minority owned equity method investment. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $500.5 million compared to 2022 driven by higher operating cash flow, primarily as a result of improvements in cash flows related to working capital and a decrease in capital expenditures compared to the prior year. Additionally, the year ended December 31, 2022 includes a $43.5 million income tax payment related to the gain on sale of Unified Brands in the fourth quarter of 2021 and a $13.4 million tax payment in 2022 related to an internal reorganization.\nCapitalization\nWe use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock. As of December 31, 2024, we maintained $1.0 billion five-year and $500.0 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facilities (together, the \"Credit Agreements\") with a syndicate of banks which expire April 6, 2028 and April 3, 2025, respectively. We may elect to extend the maturity date of any loans under the 364-day credit facility until April 3, 2026, subject to conditions specified therein. The Credit Agreements are designated as a liquidity back-stop for the Company's commercial paper program.\nAt the Company's election, loans under the Credit Agreements will bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin. The Credit Agreements require the Company to pay facility fees and impose various restrictions on the Company such as, among other things, a requirement to maintain an interest coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. The Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreements and other long-term debt covenants at December 31, 2024 and had an interest coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of 42.5 to 1. We are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants. \nWe also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions. \n45    \nTable of Contents\n \nAt December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, of which approximately $300.5 million was held outside the United States. At December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents, including cash held for sale, totaled $415.9 million, of which $286.9 million was held outside the United States. Cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in bank deposits with highly rated banks. We regularly hold cash in excess of near-term requirements in bank deposits or invest the funds in government money market instruments or short-term investments, which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months.\nWe utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. Net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents, including cash held for sale. Net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders' equity. The following table provides a calculation of net debt to net capitalization from the most directly comparable GAAP measures:\nNet Debt to Net Capitalization Ratio \n(dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nCommercial paper\n$\n— \n$\n467,600 \n$\n734,936 \nCurrent portion of long-term debt and other\n400,056 \n682 \n836 \nTotal short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt\n400,056 \n468,282 \n735,772 \nLong-term debt\n2,529,346 \n2,991,759 \n2,942,513 \nTotal debt\n2,929,402 \n3,460,041 \n3,678,285 \nLess: Cash and cash equivalents, including cash held for sale\n(1,844,877)\n(415,861)\n(380,868)\nNet debt\n1,084,525 \n3,044,180 \n3,297,417 \nAdd: Stockholders' equity\n6,953,996 \n5,106,605 \n4,286,366 \nNet capitalization\n$\n8,038,521 \n$\n8,150,785 \n$\n7,583,783 \nNet debt to net capitalization\n13.5 \n%\n37.3 \n%\n43.5 \n%\nOur net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased to 13.5% at December 31, 2024 compared to 37.3% at December 31, 2023. Net debt decreased $2.0 billion during the period primarily due to increased cash and cash equivalents from the disposition of the ESG business. Stockholders' equity increased for the period as a result of current earnings of $2.7 billion, partially offset by share repurchases under the ASR Program and dividends paid during the period.\nOur net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased to 37.3% at December 31, 2023 compared to 43.5% at December 31, 2022. Net debt decreased $253.2 million primarily due to a decrease in commercial paper borrowings and greater cash and cash equivalents, including cash held for sale. Stockholder's equity increased for the period as a result of earnings of $1.1 billion offset by $284.3 million of dividends paid.\nOur ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing. Set forth below are our credit ratings, as of December 31, 2024, which were independently developed by the respective credit agencies. The Moody's rating and outlook were issued in December 2018, and the Standard & Poor's rating was issued in December 2017 and the outlook was most recently revised in May 2021. The ratings and outlooks from both agencies were affirmed in 2024.\nShort-Term Rating\nLong-Term Rating\nOutlook\nMoody's\nP-2\nBaa1\nStable\nStandard & Poor's\nA-2\nBBB+\nStable\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately \n$160.0 million\n outstanding in letters of credit, surety bonds, and performance and other guarantees which primarily expire on various dates through \n2035\n. These letters of credit and bonds are primarily issued as security for insurance, warranty and other performance obligations. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations, the probability of which is believed to be remote.\n46    \nTable of Contents\n \nOur estimate of future interest payments on long-term debt is \n$841.2 million\n based on the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2024.\nOperating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, purchase obligations, debt maturities and lease obligations. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. \nWe believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at current risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. \nFinancial Instruments and Risk Management \nThe diverse nature of our businesses' activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highly-rated, diversified counterparties.\nInterest Rate Exposure \nAs of December 31, 2024, and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts; however, we may in the future enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. We issue commercial paper, which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates; however, maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would not have a material impact on our pre-tax earnings. \nWe consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely long-term and fixed rate in nature. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2024 year-end fair value of our long-term debt by approximately $129.1 million. However, since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturities, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position. \nForeign Currency Exposure \nWe conduct business in various non-U.S. countries, including Canada, substantially all of the European countries, Mexico, Brazil, China, India and other Asian countries. Therefore, we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks, when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities. We have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value and/or cash flow hedging programs. \nChanges in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows when translated into U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. We have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in non-U.S. operations. We may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into fair value hedges. \nAdditionally, we have designated the €600 million and €500 million of euro-denominated notes issued November 9, 2016 and November 4, 2019, respectively, as a hedge of our net investment in euro-denominated operations. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the euro-denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment. Accordingly, changes in the value of the euro-denominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in euro-denominated operations. Due to the fluctuations of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar equivalent of this debt increases or decreases, resulting in the recognition of a \n47    \nTable of Contents\n \npre-tax gain of $66.8 million, and $80.3 million in other comprehensive (loss) earnings for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2022, respectively and a pre-tax loss of $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCommodity Price Exposure\nSome of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities, such as aluminum, steel, copper and various precious metals, among others. Our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials. In some cases, we maintain longer-term index-based contracts on raw materials and component parts and centrally drive an ongoing effort to minimize risk proactively. However, we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nRevenue Recognition\nDescription\nThe majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. In limited cases, our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery, installation, testing, certification, or other promises to deliver goods or services that may impact the timing or pattern of revenue recognized. The remainder of our revenue is recognized over time, which is primarily related to services performed and specialized goods manufactured. \nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate \nA significant level of judgment is involved in the identification of performance obligations for contracts with multiple-element arrangements and the allocation of the transaction price based on the relative stand-alone selling price. The identification requires judgment to identify all distinct goods or services and also the appropriate timing of revenue recognition for each distinct good or service based on the transfer of control to the customer. We estimate the relative stand-alone selling price for performance obligations if not directly observable. A significant level of judgment is also involved in the selection of the appropriate method to recognize revenue over time.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions \nTo the extent the judgments and estimates used or the method selected to recognize revenue over time differ or change in a future period, a change to revenue and the related assets and liabilities could impact our financial position or results of operations. The judgments, estimates, and methods used have been applied consistently over the last three fiscal years.\nValuation of Acquired Intangible Assets\nDescription\nIntangible assets represent a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet as a result of current and past acquisitions. Intangible assets primarily include customer intangibles, trademarks, unpatented technologies, and patents. The fair value of acquired intangible assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, and the Company may engage third-party appraisal firms to assist with the determination of fair values of significant intangible assets. The valuation of intangible assets is performed at the time of acquisition and may change during the acquisition measurement period until the valuation is finalized. The fair value of finite-lived intangible assets is subsequently amortized over the estimated useful life. \nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate \nThe significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer intangibles include future cash flows, customer attrition rate, and discount rate. The significant assumptions for the valuation of trademarks include future revenues, royalty rate, and discount rate. The significant assumptions for the valuation of unpatented technologies and patents include future revenues, obsolescence rate, royalty rate, and discount rate. The assumptions and estimates used in the valuation of these intangible assets are based on several factors, including historical experience with similar businesses and industries and information obtained from operating company management.\n48    \nTable of Contents\n \nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions \nWhile we believe the assumptions used in our valuation of intangible assets are reasonable and representative of expected results, actual results may differ from these assumptions. While the assumptions used for each acquisition are dependent on the acquired company, the assumptions have been applied using a consistent methodology over the last three fiscal years.\nGoodwill Impairment \nDescription\nGoodwill is the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist, or when a change in the composition of reporting units for goodwill occurs for other reasons, such as a disposition or a change in segments. The impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction. \nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate \nThe significant assumptions in the fair value analysis of goodwill are the estimated future cash flows and the discount rate. The determination of future cash flows involves significant judgment and is primarily driven by forecasted revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins for the reporting unit. These assumptions are developed based on the reporting unit’s expected future performance, which considers historical performance. We use a discount rate commensurate with the inherent risks in our internally developed forecasts of future cash flows. The discount rate may also fluctuate due to market conditions such as rising interest rates.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions \nWhile we believe the assumptions used in our annual impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results and reflective of a market participant, actual results may differ from these assumptions. The methodology used for the goodwill impairment test has remained consistent over the last three fiscal years.\nValuation of Pension Benefit Obligation\nDescription\nThe pension benefit obligation is actuarially determined in accordance with GAAP and is impacted by assumptions used to estimate the obligation, namely the discount rate. Annually, we review the actuarial assumptions used and compare the assumptions to third-party benchmarks to ensure that the selected assumptions accurately account for our future pension benefit obligations. \nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n \nOur discount rate assumptions are determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit payment streams. The plans’ expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year discount rates. The 2024 weighted-average discount rate used to measure our pension benefit obligations for non-US plans decreased to \n2.64\n% from \n2.80\n% in 2023 due to a decrease in interest rates. The U.S. Plan discount rate increased to \n5.70\n% from \n5.20\n% in 2023 due to increases in corporate bond yields over this period. \nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions \nA 25-basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased pension benefit obligations by approximately $15.3 million from the amount recorded at December 31, 2024. The methodology used for the valuation of the pension benefit obligation has remained consistent over the last three fiscal years.\nRecoverability of Deferred Income Tax Assets and Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nDescription\nWe operate in and are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions and are subject to ongoing audits by federal, state, and non-U.S. tax authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets and evaluating unrecognized tax benefits. \n49    \nTable of Contents\n \nWe have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are evaluated for recoverability and valued accordingly. Management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each jurisdiction in which the Company operates. We record valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized.\nThe provision for unrecognized tax benefits provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for determining the financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. \nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n \nIn assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance, we consider all positive and negative evidence, including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, historical and projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. Additionally, significant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. \nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions \nAlthough we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ and result in additional tax expense or benefit. If we determine a valuation allowance should be recognized to reduce the carrying value of a deferred tax asset or a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit needs to be recorded, the adjustment would result in a change to tax expense in the period such determination is made. We have not made any material changes in the process we use to assess valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits over the last three fiscal years.\nContingencies\nDescription\nLiabilities are established for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate \nThe valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense. The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues. Estimates used in the valuations include the probable outcome of such proceedings, the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred and currently accrued to-date and consider the availability and extent of insurance coverage. Such liability balances contain uncertainties due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each proceeding, changes in applicable laws and regulations, and other future events and decisions by third parties that may impact the ultimate resolution of a proceeding. \nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions \nAlthough we believe that the amount accrued to-date is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations, and we may be exposed to a material loss. For example, to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our contingent liability in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. However, the Company does not believe that it is currently involved in any legal proceedings which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. \nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 — Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and recently adopted accounting standards.\n50    \nTable of Contents\n \nNon-GAAP Disclosures\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we also disclose non-GAAP information, which we believe provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations, net debt, net capitalization, net debt to net capitalization ratio, adjusted working capital, and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, working capital or revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of liquidity. Net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ. Free cash flow and free cash flow ratios provide both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase our common stock. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital provides a meaningful measure of liquidity by showing changes caused by operational results. We believe that reporting organic revenue growth provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods.\nReconciliations and comparisons to non-GAAP measures can be found above in this Item 7, MD&A.",
