These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments, as applicable); Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol segment margin; and capital investments attributable to Valero. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between years, to help assess our cash flows, and because we believe they provide useful information as discussed further below. See the tables in note (b) beginning on page \n52\n for reconciliations of adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments, as applicable) and Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol segment margin to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also in note (b), we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of such non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information. See the table on page \n59\n for a reconciliation of capital investments attributable to Valero to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n \nAlso on page \n59\n, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information.\nOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK\nOverview\nBusiness Operations Update \nOur results for the year ended December 31, 2024 were supported by stable worldwide demand for petroleum-based transportation fuels. In addition, our focus on reliable, low-cost operations favorably impacted our results despite a weaker margin environment in 2024.\nWe reported $2.8 billion of net income attributable to Valero stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our operating results for 2024, including operating results by segment, are described in the summary on the following page, and detailed descriptions can be found under “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” beginning on page \n46\n.\nOur operations generated $6.7 billion of cash in 2024. This cash, along with cash on hand, was used to make $2.1 billion of capital investments in our business and return $4.3 billion to our stockholders through purchases of common stock for treasury and dividend payments. In addition, we reduced our outstanding debt during 2024 through the repayment of the $167 million outstanding principal balance of our 1.200 percent Senior Notes that matured in March 2024. As a result of this and other activity, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased by $595 million during 2024 to $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2024. We had $9.6 billion in liquidity as of December 31, 2024. The components of our liquidity and descriptions of our cash flows, capital investments, and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources can be found under “LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES” beginning on page \n55\n.\n43\nTable of Contents\nResults for the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nFor 2024, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $2.8 billion compared to $8.8 billion for 2023. The decrease of $6.1 billion was primarily due to a decrease in operating income of $8.1 billion, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $1.9 billion. The details of our operating income and adjusted operating income, where applicable, by segment and in total are reflected below (in millions). Adjusted operating income excludes the adjustment reflected in the tables in note (b) beginning on page \n52\n.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\nRefining segment:\nOperating income\n$\n3,971 \n$\n11,511 \n$\n(7,540)\nAdjusted operating income\n3,988 \n11,528 \n(7,540)\nRenewable Diesel segment:\nOperating income\n507 \n852 \n(345)\nEthanol segment:\nOperating income\n288 \n553 \n(265)\nAdjusted operating income\n315 \n569 \n(254)\nTotal company:\nOperating income\n3,755 \n11,858 \n(8,103)\nAdjusted operating income\n3,799 \n11,891 \n(8,092)\nWhile our operating income decreased by $8.1 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, adjusted operating income also decreased by $8.1 billion primarily due to the following:\n•\nRefining segment.\n Refining segment adjusted operating income decreased by $7.5 billion primarily due to lower gasoline and distillate (primarily diesel) margins, a decline in crude oil differentials, and a decrease in throughput volumes, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense).\n•\nRenewable Diesel segment.\n Renewable Diesel segment operating income decreased by $345 million primarily due to lower product prices (primarily renewable diesel), partially offset by lower feedstock costs. \n•\nEthanol segment.\n Ethanol segment adjusted operating income decreased by $254 million primarily due to lower ethanol and corn-related co-product prices, partially offset by lower corn prices and an increase in production volumes.\n44\nTable of Contents\nOutlook\nMany uncertainties remain with respect to the supply and demand balances in petroleum-based product markets worldwide. While it is difficult to predict future worldwide economic activity and its impact on product supply and demand, as well as any effect that the uncertainty described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements or other political or regulatory developments may have on us, we have noted several factors below that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2025.\n•\nGasoline and diesel demand have exceeded pre-pandemic levels and are expected to follow typical seasonal patterns. Jet fuel demand continues to improve, outpacing gasoline and diesel demand growth, and is approaching pre-pandemic levels in the U.S.\n•\nCombined light product (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) inventories across the U.S. and Europe remain comparable to recent historical levels. Expected reductions in refining capacity in 2025 should support high utilization of refining capacity.\n•\nCrude oil differentials are expected to remain relatively stable. However, potential sanction adjustments related to Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and potential U.S. tariffs on crude imports from Canada and Mexico could result in increased volatility in the crude oil market and potentially impact crude oil differentials.\n•\nRenewable diesel demand is expected to remain consistent with current levels.\n•\nEthanol demand is expected to follow typical seasonal patterns.\n45\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables, including the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in note (b)\n \nbeginning on page \n52\n, highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market reference prices that directly impact our operations.

This decrease in revenues was partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales of $6.8 billion primarily due to decreases in crude oil and other feedstock costs. These changes resulted in an $8.1 billion decrease in operating income, from $11.9 billion in 2023 to $3.8 billion in 2024.\nAdjusted operating income also decreased by $8.1 billion, from $11.9 billion in 2023 to $3.8 billion in 2024. The components of this $8.1 billion decrease in adjusted operating income are discussed by segment in the segment analyses that follow.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $1.9 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of a decrease in income before income tax expense.\n49\nTable of Contents\nRefining Segment Results\nThe following table includes selected financial and operating data of our Refining segment for 2024 and 2023.

The components of this decrease in the adjusted results, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are outlined below.\n•\nRefining segment margin decreased by $7.8 billion in 2024 compared to 2023. \nRefining segment margin is primarily affected by the prices for the petroleum-based transportation fuels that we sell and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we process. The table on page \n48\n reflects market reference prices and differentials that we believe impacted our Refining segment margin in 2024 compared to 2023. \nThe decrease in Refining segment margin was primarily due to the following:\n◦\nA decrease in distillate (primarily diesel) margins had an unfavorable impact of approximately $4.3 billion.\n◦\nA decrease in gasoline margins had an unfavorable impact of approximately $2.4 billion.\n◦\nA decline in crude oil differentials had an unfavorable impact of approximately $585 million.\n◦\nA decrease in throughput volumes of 67,000 barrels per day had an unfavorable impact of approximately $260 million.\n•\nRefining segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) decreased by $262 million primarily due to decreases in energy costs of $149 million, property taxes of $52 million, and chemicals and catalyst costs of $39 million.\n50\nTable of Contents\nRenewable Diesel Segment Results\nThe following table includes selected financial and operating data of our Renewable Diesel segment for 2024 and 2023.

The table on page \n49\n reflects market reference prices that we believe impacted our Ethanol segment margin in 2024 compared to 2023.\nThe decrease in Ethanol segment margin was primarily due to the following:\n•\nA decrease in ethanol prices had an unfavorable impact of approximately $875 million.\n•\nA decrease in prices for the co-products that we produce, primarily DDGs and inedible DCOs, had an unfavorable impact of approximately $300 million.\n•\nA decrease in corn prices had a favorable impact of approximately $905 million.\n•\nAn increase in production volumes of 171,000 gallons per day had a favorable impact of approximately $35 million.\n________________________\nThe following notes relate to references on pages \n46\n \nthrough \n52\n.\n(a)\nUnder current tax law, producers of second-generation biofuels that are registered with the IRS are eligible for an income tax credit of up to $1.01 per gallon of qualified biofuel that was produced and sold in the U.S. through December 31, 2024. The benefit of the tax credit is recognized as a reduction of the producer’s income tax expense. \nIn December 2024, the IRS approved our application for registration as a producer of second-generation biofuels with respect to the cellulosic ethanol produced at our ethanol plants. As a result, income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes a current income tax benefit of $79 million for the tax credit attributable to volumes of cellulosic ethanol produced and sold by us in the U.S. from 2020 through 2024.\n(b)\nWe use certain financial measures (as noted below) that are not defined under GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods after adjusting for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes their utility.\n52\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions):\n•\nRefining margin \nis defined as Refining segment operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses, as reflected in the table below.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nReconciliation of Refining operating income\nto Refining margin\nRefining operating income \n$\n3,971 \n$\n11,511 \nAdjustments:\nOperating expenses (excluding depreciation and \namortization expense)\n4,946 \n5,208 \nDepreciation and amortization expense\n2,391 \n2,351 \nOther operating expenses\n17 \n17 \nRefining margin\n$\n11,325 \n$\n19,087 \n•\nRenewable Diesel margin\n is defined as Renewable Diesel segment operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and depreciation and amortization expense, as reflected in the table below.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nReconciliation of Renewable Diesel operating income\nto Renewable Diesel margin\nRenewable Diesel operating income\n$\n507 \n$\n852 \nAdjustments:\nOperating expenses (excluding depreciation and \namortization expense)\n350 \n358 \nDepreciation and amortization expense\n265 \n231 \nRenewable Diesel margin\n$\n1,122 \n$\n1,441 \n•\nEthanol margin\n is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses, as reflected in the table below.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nReconciliation of Ethanol operating income \nto Ethanol margin\nEthanol operating income \n$\n288 \n$\n553 \nAdjustments:\nOperating expenses (excluding depreciation and \namortization expense)\n536 \n515 \nDepreciation and amortization expense \n77 \n80 \nOther operating expenses\n27 \n16 \nEthanol margin\n$\n928 \n$\n1,164 \n53\nTable of Contents\n•\nAdjusted Refining operating income \nis defined as Refining segment operating income excluding other operating expenses, as reflected in the table below.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nReconciliation of Refining operating income\nto adjusted Refining operating income\nRefining operating income\n$\n3,971 \n$\n11,511 \nAdjustment: Other operating expenses\n17 \n17 \nAdjusted Refining operating income\n$\n3,988 \n$\n11,528 \n•\nAdjusted Ethanol operating income\n is defined as Ethanol segment operating income excluding other operating expenses, as reflected in the table below.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nReconciliation of Ethanol operating income \nto adjusted Ethanol operating income\nEthanol operating income\n$\n288 \n$\n553 \nAdjustment: Other operating expenses\n27 \n16 \nAdjusted Ethanol operating income\n$\n315 \n$\n569 \n•\nAdjusted operating income\n is defined as total company operating income excluding other operating expenses, as reflected in the table below.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nReconciliation of total company operating income \nto adjusted operating income\nTotal company operating income\n$\n3,755 \n$\n11,858 \nAdjustment: Other operating expenses\n44 \n33 \nAdjusted operating income\n$\n3,799 \n$\n11,891 \n(c)\nThe RVO cost represents the average market cost on a per barrel basis to comply with the RFS program.

Proceeds from this debt issuance totaled $649 million before deducting the underwriting discount and other debt issuance costs. The net proceeds from this debt issuance are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment, repurchase, or redemption of our outstanding 3.65 percent Senior Notes due March 15, 2025 and 2.850 percent Senior Notes due April 15, 2025.\nOur debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements may increase. As of December 31, 2024, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt, including debt guaranteed by us, were at or above investment grade level as follows:\nRating Agency\nRating\nMoody’s Investors Service\nBaa2 (stable outlook)\nStandard & Poor’s Ratings Services\nBBB (stable outlook)\nFitch Ratings\nBBB (stable outlook)\nWe cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.\nWe believe we have sufficient funds from operations and from available capacity under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments over the next 12\n \nmonths and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

The debt borrowings and repayments are described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs previously noted, our operations generated $6.7 billion of cash in 2024, driven primarily by net income of $3.0 billion, noncash charges to income of $2.9 billion, and a positive change in working capital of $795 million. Noncash charges primarily included $2.8 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. Details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for an analysis of the significant components of our net income.\nOur investing activities of $2.0 billion primarily consisted of $2.1 billion\n \nin capital investments, as defined on the following page under “Capital Investments,” of which $321 million related to capital investments made by DGD.\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nIn 2023, we used the $9.2 billion of cash generated by our operations and the $2.4 billion in debt borrowings to make $1.9 billion of investments in our business, repay $2.7 billion of debt and finance lease obligations (including premiums paid on the early retirement of debt), return $6.6 billion to our stockholders through purchases of our common stock for treasury and dividend payments, and increase \n56\nTable of Contents\nour available cash on hand by $562 million. The debt borrowings and repayments are described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs previously noted, our operations generated $9.2 billion of cash in 2023, driven primarily by net income of $9.1 billion and noncash charges to income of $2.4 billion, partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $2.3 billion. Noncash charges primarily included $2.7 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and $103 million of deferred income tax expense. Details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see “RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for an analysis of the significant components of our net income.\nOur investing activities primarily consisted of $1.9 billion in capital investments, of which $294 million related to capital investments made by DGD.\nOur Capital Resources\nOur material cash requirements as of December 31, 2024 primarily consisted of working capital requirements, capital investments, contractual obligations, and other matters, as described below. Our operations have historically generated positive cash flows to fulfill our working capital requirements and other uses of cash as discussed below.\nCapital Investments\nCapital investments are composed of our capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures, as reflected in our statements of cash flows as shown on page \n74\n. Capital investments exclude acquisitions, if any.\nWe also identify our capital investments by the nature of the project with which the expenditure is associated as follows:\n•\nSustaining capital investments\n are generally associated with projects that are expected to extend the lives of our property assets, sustain their operating capabilities and safety (including deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures), or comply with regulatory requirements. Regulatory compliance capital investments are generally associated with projects that are incurred to comply with government regulatory requirements, such as requirements to reduce emissions and prohibited elements from our products.\n•\nGrowth capital investments\n, including low-carbon growth capital investments that support the development and growth of our low-carbon renewable diesel and ethanol businesses, are generally associated with projects for the construction of new property assets that are expected to enhance our profitability and cash-generating capabilities, including investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe have developed an extensive multi-year capital investment program, which we update and revise based on changing internal and external factors. Our capital investment program aims to manage our capital investments on average over a multi-year period given the year-to-year variability with respect to timing, costs, and other aspects of capital projects, particularly growth capital projects. Capital projects may be accelerated, deferred, or canceled based on costs, market and economic conditions, regulatory approvals, project execution, competing uses of capital, and other variables, and capital investments and costs may particularly increase or decrease at the beginning and ending of a project. The variability in our \n57\nTable of Contents\nyear-to-year growth capital investments primarily reflects shifts in expected timing and costs of capital projects rather than a change in our capital allocation strategy.\nThe following table reflects our expected capital investments for the year ending December 31, 2025 by nature of the project and reportable segment, along with historical amounts for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions).

We believe that our allocation of growth capital into low-carbon projects to date has been consistent with such targets and ambition. Certain low-carbon projects have been completed or are already in execution and the associated capital investments are included in our expected capital investments for 2025. Our capital investments in future years to achieve these targets and ambition are expected to include investments associated with certain low-carbon projects currently at various stages of progress, evaluation, or approval. See “ITEMS 1. and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES—OUR COMPREHENSIVE LIQUID FUELS STRATEGY—\nOur Low-Carbon Projects\n” for a description of our low-carbon projects.\n58\nTable of Contents\nCapital Investments Attributable to Valero\nCapital investments attributable to Valero is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects our net share of capital investments and is defined as all capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures, excluding the portion of DGD’s capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member and all of the capital expenditures of other consolidated VIEs.\nWe are a 50 percent joint venture member in DGD and consolidate its financial statements, and DGD’s operations compose our Renewable Diesel segment. As a result, all of DGD’s net cash provided by operating activities (or operating cash flow) is included in our consolidated net cash provided by operating activities. DGD’s members use DGD’s operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. Because DGD’s operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member, only 50 percent of DGD’s capital investments should be attributed to our net share of capital investments. We also exclude all of the capital expenditures of other VIEs that we consolidate because we do not operate those VIEs. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the VIEs that we consolidate. We believe capital investments attributable to Valero is an important measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments.\nCapital investments attributable to Valero should not be considered as an alternative to capital investments, which is the most comparable GAAP measure, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our cash flows as reported under GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define it differently, which may diminish its utility.\nThe following table (in millions) reconciles our capital investments to capital investments attributable to Valero for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nReconciliation of capital investments\nto capital investments attributable to Valero\nCapital expenditures (excluding VIEs)\n$\n649 \n$\n665 \nCapital expenditures of VIEs:\nDGD\n250 \n235 \nOther VIEs\n8 \n11 \nDeferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures\n(excluding VIEs)\n1,079 \n946 \nDeferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures\nof DGD\n71 \n59 \nInvestments in nonconsolidated joint ventures\n— \n— \nCapital investments\n2,057 \n1,916 \nAdjustments:\nDGD’s capital investments attributable to the other\njoint venture member\n(161)\n(147)\nCapital expenditures of other VIEs\n(8)\n(11)\nCapital investments attributable to Valero\n$\n1,888 \n$\n1,758 \n59\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nBelow is a summary of our contractual obligations (in millions) as of December 31, 2024 that are expected to be paid within the next year and thereafter.

Operating lease liabilities and finance lease obligations reflected in this table include related interest expense. \n(d)\nOther long-term liabilities are described in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other long-term liabilities exclude amounts related to the long-term portion of operating lease liabilities that are separately presented above.\n(e)\nPurchase obligations are described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations are based on (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (ii) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions.\nThe amount outstanding associated with the IEnova Revolver, as defined and described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is reflected in current portion of debt and finance lease obligations in our balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, and also included in the table above in debt obligations – short-term. The IEnova Revolver is subject to repayment on demand; however, we do not expect the lender to demand repayment during the next 12 months. Thus, the final cash flows for this instrument cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.\nIn 2024, we repaid $167 million of our public debt that matured in March 2024. We will continue to evaluate further deleveraging opportunities.\nWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.\nOther Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources\nStock Purchase Programs\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we purchased for treasury 19,115,715 of our shares for a total cost of $2.9 billion. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.8 billion and $2.5 billion remaining available for purchase under the February 2024 and September 2024 Programs, respectively. We will continue to evaluate the timing of purchases when appropriate. We have no obligation to make purchases under these programs.\n60\nTable of Contents\nPension Plan Funding\nDuring 2025, we plan to contribute approximately $130 million and $20 million to our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our employee benefit plans.\nTax Matters\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has introduced a framework that provides for a 15 percent global minimum effective tax rate for large multinational corporations on the income arising in each jurisdiction where they operate, known as Pillar Two. While all OECD countries and jurisdictions have agreed to Pillar Two, the related rules are being implemented on a country-by-country basis. The U.S. has not yet implemented these rules; however, countries in which we operate, such as Canada, the U.K., and Ireland, have enacted tax legislation to implement Pillar Two with effective dates in 2024, and we are subject to the tax laws of those countries. These rules did not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in 2024, and we currently do not expect that compliance with these rules will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in 2025.\nCash Held by Our Foreign Subsidiaries\nAs of December 31, 2024, $3.7 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held by our foreign subsidiaries can be repatriated to us through dividends without any U.S. federal income tax consequences, but certain other taxes may apply, including, but not limited to, withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions, U.S. state income taxes, and U.S. federal income tax on foreign exchange gains. Therefore, there is a cost to repatriate cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries to us.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by government authorities relating to, among other matters, the release or discharge of materials into the environment, climate, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG and other emissions, our facilities and operations, and characteristics and composition of many of our products. Because environmental laws and regulations have become more complex and stringent and new or revised environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future costs and expenditures required for environmental matters could increase. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of our environmental liabilities. In addition,\n \nsee Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our accounting for these liabilities under “Environmental Matters.” See also “ITEMS 1. and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES—GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS” and the items incorporated by reference therein.\nConcentration of Customers\nOur operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions, including the uncertainties concerning worldwide events causing volatility in the global crude oil markets. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. See also “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS—Legal, Government, and Regulatory Risks—\nWe are subject to risks arising from legal, regulatory, and political developments regarding climate-related matters, GHG emissions, and the environment, or that are adverse to or restrict refining and marketing operations\n.”\n61\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nWe take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that ultimately may not be allowed by the relevant taxing authorities. When we take such positions, we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions, if any, that should be recognized in our financial statements. Tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained.\nThe evaluation of tax positions and the determination of the benefit arising from such positions that are recognized in our financial statements requires us to make significant judgments and estimates based on an analysis of complex tax laws and regulations and related interpretations. These judgments and estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and changes in legislation.\nDetails of our changes in unrecognized tax benefits, along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits, are included in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets (primarily property, plant, and equipment) are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, with fair value determined based on discounted estimated net cash flows or other appropriate methods.\nIn order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, assumptions about future sales volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, the use or disposition of the asset, the asset’s estimated remaining useful life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset’s existing service potential in light of existing and expected regulations. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings.\n62\nTable of Contents\nNew environmental and tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing laws and regulations, are continuously being enacted or proposed. The implementation of future legislative and regulatory initiatives (such as those discussed in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS) that may adversely affect our operations could indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and result in an impairment loss that could be material. If the circumstances that trigger an impairment also result in a reduction in the estimated useful life of the asset, then we may also be required to recognize an asset retirement obligation for that asset.
