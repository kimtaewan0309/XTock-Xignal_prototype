MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis is the company’s analysis of its financial performance, financial condition, and significant trends that may affect future performance.  It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe term “earnings” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refers to net income attributable to Phillips 66.  The terms “results,” “before-tax income” or “before-tax loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to income (loss) before income taxes. \nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nPhillips 66 is uniquely positioned as a leading integrated downstream energy provider operating with Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, Marketing and Specialties (M&S), and Renewable Fuels segments.  At December 31, 2024, we had total assets of $72.6 billion.\nExecutive Overview\nDuring 2024, we reported earnings of $2.1 billion and generated $4.2 billion in cash from operating activities.  We funded capital expenditures and investments of $1.9 billion, completed acquisitions for cash consideration of $625 million, purchased government obligations of $1.1 billion that were ultimately used to extinguish debt, and received proceeds from asset dispositions of $1.1 billion.  Additionally, we received proceeds from debt issuances, net of debt repayments, of $2.1 billion.  We paid $3.5 billion to repurchase common stock and $1.9 billion to fund dividends on our common stock.  We ended 2024 with $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $4.6 billion of total committed capacity available under our credit facilities.  \nStrategic Priorities\nIn November 2022, we announced financial and operational targets toward achieving the company’s strategic priorities, and in October 2023, we announced updates and enhancements to certain of those targets.  The strategic priority targets were focused on achieving financial and operational goals through year-end 2024, with an emphasis on delivering shareholder returns; improving refining performance; capturing value from wellhead-to-market; executing business transformation initiatives; maintaining financial strength and flexibility; and driving disciplined growth and returns. \nIn January 2025, we announced the next phase of priorities along with financial and operational initiatives through year-end 2027.  With these targets, the company is continuing to focus on creating shareholder value; driving disciplined growth and returns; and maintaining financial strength and flexibility.  As the company has completed its business transformation efforts, the company has shifted to operational and cost reduction targets intended to drive world-class operations across its portfolio, while maintaining emphasis on growing its Midstream and Chemicals businesses. \n•\nShareholder Returns –\n We believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, a secure, competitive and growing dividend, complemented by share repurchases.  With the return of $5.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during 2024, we achieved our target of returning between $13 billion and $15 billion to our shareholders from July 2022 to year-end 2024, as we distributed a total of $13.6 billion to shareholders.  Our new target aims to return greater than 50% of net cash provided by operating activities to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  The amount and timing of future dividend payments and the level and timing of future share repurchases is subject to the discretion of, and approval by, our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors including our share price, results of operations, financial condition and cash required for future business plans.  \n48\n•\nWorld-Class Operations – \nWe are focused on achieving operational excellence by optimizing utilization rates and product yield at our refineries through reliable and safe operations, which will enable us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins.  With our new targets, we will remain focused on a competitive cost structure and plan to enhance Refining segment returns and increase our utilization rates by focusing on low-capital, higher-return projects that increase asset reliability and improve market capture.  \nAt year-end 2024, we achieved final total company run-rate cost savings of $1.5 billion through our business transformation efforts, including a $0.3 billion reduction of sustaining capital, exceeding our targeted savings on a run-rate basis.  Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 95% for 2024, and our worldwide refining clean product yield was 87%, compared to 92% and 85%, respectively, in 2023.  Our new priorities for 2025-2027 continue to focus on Refining performance, targeting an annual clean product yield of greater than 86%, crude oil capacity utilization rates higher than industry average, and continuing to improve our competitive cost structure.\n•\nDisciplined Growth and Returns – \nA disciplined capital allocation process ensures we invest in projects that are expected to generate competitive returns.  Our strategy remains focused on growing our Midstream and Chemicals businesses.  Within our Midstream segment, we are primarily focused on maximizing the value of our fully integrated natural gas liquids (NGL) wellhead-to-market value chain.  \n▪\nDuring 2024, we completed the conversion of our San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, into the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex (Rodeo Complex).  \n▪\nIn 2024, we funded capital expenditures and investments of $1.9 billion and completed acquisitions of $0.6 billion through disciplined capital allocation and $1.1 billion in proceeds from asset dispositions.  In January 2025, we received proceeds from asset dispositions of $2.1 billion and we will continue to evaluate future opportunities to rationalize our asset portfolio.  We have budgeted $2.1 billion for 2025 capital expenditures and investments, exclusive of acquisitions, which includes $1.1 billion of growth capital, primarily in our Midstream segment.  \n▪\nDuring 2024, we expanded our Midstream NGL wellhead-to-market platform with the acquisition of Pinnacle Midland Parent LLC (Pinnacle Midstream) and approval of a follow-on processing plant expansion in the Midland Basin expected to be completed in mid-2025.  In addition, we achieved over $500 million of run-rate synergies from the integration of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, which is comprised of the businesses, activities, assets and liabilities of DCP Midstream, LP (DCP LP) and its subsidiaries and general partner entities, surpassing our target.  \n▪\nOur new financial targets for 2025-2027 reflect our plans to grow Midstream and Chemicals businesses, as well as maintain total annual capital expenditures and investments of approximately $2 billion, excluding acquisitions.\n•\nFinancial Strength and Flexibility – \nWe use a variety of funding sources to support our liquidity requirements, including cash from operations, debt and proceeds from dispositions.  Our focus remains on protecting the stable cash generation from the Midstream and Marketing and Specialties (M&S) businesses while balancing continued portfolio optimization.  \n▪\nDuring 2024, we used available cash and proceeds from asset dispositions and debt offerings to fund capital expenditures and investments, complete the acquisition of Pinnacle Midstream, purchase government obligations that were ultimately used to extinguish debt, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock.  \n▪\nWe are targeting reductions of total debt to $17 billion and reductions of our debt to capital ratio.\n49\nBasis of Presentation\nEffective April 1, 2024, we changed the internal financial information reviewed by our chief executive officer to evaluate performance and allocate resources to our operating segments.  This resulted in changes to the composition of our operating segments, as well as measurement changes for certain activities between our operating segments.  The primary effects are summarized below.  Prior period information has been recast for comparability.  \n•\nEstablishment of a Renewable Fuels operating segment, which includes renewable fuels activities and assets historically reported in our Refining, M&S and Midstream operating segments.  \n•\nChange in method of allocating results for certain Gulf Coast distillate export activities from our M&S operating segment to our Refining operating segment. \n•\nReclassification of certain crude oil and international clean products trading activities between our M&S operating segment and our Refining operating segment.\n•\nChange in reporting of our investment in NOVONIX Limited (NOVONIX) from our Midstream operating segment to Corporate and Other.  \nIn the third quarter of 2024, we began presenting the line item “Capital expenditures and investments” on our consolidated statement of cash flows exclusive of acquisitions, net of cash acquired.  Prior period information has been reclassified for comparability. \nStarting on August 18, 2022, our Midstream operating segment and consolidated results reflect the impacts of the merger of DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger (DCP Midstream Merger).  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n50\nBusiness Environment\nThe Midstream segment includes our Transportation and NGL businesses.  Our Transportation business contains fee-based operations not directly exposed to commodity price risk.  Our NGL business, including DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Southern Hills), contains both fee-based operations and operations directly impacted by NGL and natural gas prices.  The weighted-average NGL price was $0.68 per gallon during 2024, compared with $0.67 per gallon during 2023.  The Henry Hub natural gas price was $2.24 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) during 2024, compared with $2.53 per MMBtu during 2023.  The increase in NGL prices was primarily due to higher demand and increased exports, while the decrease in natural gas prices was partially due to increased production and constraints on Permian natural gas exit capacity.\nThe Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).  The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand, as well as cost factors.  The benchmark high-density polyethylene chain margin was 17.7 cents per pound in 2024, compared with 16.4 cents per pound in 2023.  The increase was mainly due to improved polyethylene sales prices and lower natural gas and ethane prices.\nOur Refining segment results are driven by several factors, including market crack spreads, refinery throughput, feedstock costs, product yields, turnaround activity, and other operating costs.  Market crack spreads are used as indicators of refining margins and measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil.  The composite 3:2:1 market crack spread for our business decreased to an average of $16.95 per barrel during 2024, from an average of $28.37 per barrel in 2023.  The decrease in the composite market crack spread was primarily driven by higher supply due to increased global refining utilization and lower global prices for gasoline and diesel.  The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil, West Texas Intermediate at Cushing, Oklahoma, decreased to an average of $75.83 per barrel during 2024, from an average of $77.69 per barrel in 2023.  The decrease in crude oil prices was primarily driven by increased production in the United States and other countries outside of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).  \nResults for our M&S segment depend largely on marketing fuel and lubricant margins and sales volumes of our refined products.  While marketing fuel and lubricant margins are primarily driven by market factors, largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand, marketing fuel margins, in particular, are influenced by trends in spot prices, and where applicable, retail prices for refined products in the regions and countries where we operate.\nOur Renewable Fuels segment consists of the operations and assets of the Rodeo Complex, as well as the global activities to procure renewable feedstocks, manage certain regulatory credits, and market renewable fuels.  Results for our Renewable Fuels segment are impacted by several factors, including the market price of renewable fuels, feedstock costs, throughput, operating costs, and the value of certain regulatory credits, as well as other market factors, largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand.\n51\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results\nA summary of income (loss) before income taxes by operating segment with a reconciliation to net income attributable to Phillips 66 follows:\n \n \nMillions of Dollars\nYear Ended December 31\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nMidstream\n$\n2,638\n \n2,819 \n5,176 \nChemicals\n876\n \n600 \n856 \nRefining\n(365)\n5,340 \n7,976 \nMarketing and Specialties\n1,011\n \n1,897 \n2,072 \nRenewable Fuels\n(198)\n153 \n171 \nCorporate and Other\n(1,287)\n(1,340)\n(1,612)\nIncome before income taxes\n2,675\n \n9,469 \n14,639 \nIncome tax expense \n500\n \n2,230 \n3,248 \nNet income \n2,175\n \n7,239 \n11,391 \nLess: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n58\n \n224 \n367 \nNet income attributable to Phillips 66\n$\n2,117\n \n7,015 \n11,024 \n2024 vs. 2023 \nNet income attributable to Phillips 66 for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $2,117 million, compared with $7,015 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.  The decrease in 2024 was primarily due to a decline in realized refining margins primarily driven by lower market crack spreads, partially offset by lower income tax expense.  \n2023 vs. 2022 \nNet income attributable to Phillips 66 for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $7,015 million, compared with $11,024 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.  The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to the recognition of an aggregate before-tax gain of $3,013 million in 2022 in our Midstream segment in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger, and a decline in realized refining margins, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense and lower unrealized investment losses related to our investment in NOVONIX. \nSee the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results and Note 24—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.  See also Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the DCP Midstream Merger. \n52\nStatement of Income Analysis\n2024 vs. 2023 \nSales and other operating revenues\n decreased 3%, primarily due to lower prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil, partially offset by an increase in prices for NGL.  \nPurchased crude oil and products\n increased 1% in 2024, primarily due to higher refined product purchase volumes, partially offset by lower prices for refined petroleum products.\nEquity in earnings of affiliates\n decreased 12% in 2024, primarily due to lower equity earnings from WRB Refining LP (WRB) as a result of decreased margins, Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (REX) due to the sale of our ownership interest in 2024, South Texas Gateway Terminal due to the sale of our ownership interest in 2023, and Excel Paralubes LLC due to declining margins, partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower maintenance costs.  These decreases were partially offset by higher equity earnings from CPChem.  See the Chemicals segment analysis in the “Segment Results” section for additional information.  \nNet gain on dispositions\n increased $206 million in 2024, primarily due to a before-tax gain of $238 million associated with the sale of our ownership interest in REX, as well as a before-tax gain of $67 million associated with the foreign currency forward contracts entered into in connection with the sale of our ownership interest in Coop Mineraloel AG (Coop).  These increases were partially offset by before-tax gains totaling $137 million associated with the sales of our ownership interests in the South Texas Gateway Terminal and the Belle Chasse Terminal in 2023.  See Note 9—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our sales of REX and Coop.\nOther income\n decreased 32% in 2024, primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower cash balances and decreased results from trading activities.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n increased 11% in 2024, mainly driven by an accrual of $605 million recorded during the third quarter of 2024 related to litigation with Propel Fuels, Inc. (Propel Fuels).  The increase was partially offset by lower employee-related expenses and selling expenses.  See Note 17—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our litigation with Propel Fuels.\nDepreciation and amortization\n increased 20% in 2024, primarily due to $253 million of accelerated depreciation recorded in 2024 associated with our plan to cease operations at our Los Angeles Refinery during the fourth quarter of 2025, as well as depreciation and amortization associated with the startup of additional production capacity at the Rodeo Complex.  See Note 4—Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our plans to cease operations at our Los Angeles Refinery.\nImpairments\n increased $432 million in 2024, primarily due to before-tax impairments recorded in our Midstream segment of certain gathering and processing assets in Texas, an equity investment in a crude pipeline in Oklahoma and certain crude gathering assets in Texas.  In 2024, we also recorded before-tax impairments in our Midstream and Refining segments related to certain crude oil processing and logistics assets in California.  See Note 12—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding impairments. \nTaxes other than income taxes\n decreased 53% in 2024, primarily due to an increase in tax credits generated from higher renewable diesel production and blending activity. \nIncome tax expense\n decreased 78% in 2024, primarily due to lower income before income taxes.  See Note 24—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our income taxes.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n decreased 74% in 2024.  The decrease primarily reflects the impacts of the acquisition of all publicly held common units of DCP LP in June 2023 (DCP LP Merger), as well as the impacts of before-tax impairments reported in our Midstream segment related to certain DCP LP gathering and processing assets in Texas.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, and Note 12—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n53\n2023 vs. 2022 \nSales and other operating revenues\n and \npurchased crude oil and products\n decreased 13% and 15%, respectively, in 2023.  These decreases were mainly due to lower prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL.\nEquity in earnings of affiliates\n decreased 32% in 2023, resulting from lower equity earnings from DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills, DCP Southern Hills and Gray Oak Pipeline as a result of the DCP Midstream Merger in August 2022, as well as decreased equity earnings from WRB and CPChem primarily due to lower margins, partially offset by lower operating costs.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the Chemicals segment analysis in the “Segment Results” section for additional information.\nNet gain on dispositions\n increased $108 million in 2023, primarily due to a before-tax gain recognized in the Midstream segment in the third quarter of 2023 associated with the sale of our 25% ownership interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal.\nOther income\n decreased $2,378 million in 2023, primarily due to an aggregate before-tax gain of $3,013 million recognized in our Midstream segment in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger in August 2022.  The decrease was partially offset by lower unrealized investment losses on our investment in NOVONIX in 2023 compared with 2022, and higher interest income.  See Note 5—Business Combinations, and Note 19—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the aggregate before-tax gain, and for additional information regarding our investment in NOVONIX.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n increased 16% in 2023, mainly driven by the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills starting in August 2022 and higher costs associated with our business transformation.  These increases were partially offset by lower selling expenses due to decreased refined petroleum product prices.  See Note 4—Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding business transformation restructuring costs. \nDepreciation and amortization\n increased 21% in 2023, primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization related to assets acquired as a result of consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Southern Hills and DCP Sand Hills starting in August 2022. \nTaxes other than income taxes\n increased 33% in 2023, primarily due to consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills starting in August 2022 and an increase in environmental taxes. \nInterest and debt expense\n increased 45% in 2023, primarily driven by higher interest expense as a result of consolidating DCP Midstream Class A Segment, new debt issuances in 2023 related to the DCP LP Merger, and a $53 million before-tax loss on the early redemption of DCP LP’s 5.850% junior subordinated notes.\nIncome tax expense\n decreased 31% in 2023 primarily due to lower income before income taxes.  See Note 24—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our income taxes.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n decreased 39% in 2023.  The decrease reflects the impacts of the DCP LP Merger in June 2023, and the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills and the derecognition of a noncontrolling interest related to Gray Oak Holdings as a result of the DCP Midstream Merger in August 2022.  The decrease also reflects the impact of the merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners LP (Phillips 66 Partners), a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, in March 2022.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, and Note 30—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the DCP Midstream Merger and the Phillips 66 Partners merger, respectively. \n54\nSegment Results\nMidstream\n \n \nYear Ended December 31\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nMillions of Dollars\nIncome Before Income Taxes\nTransportation\n$\n1,292\n \n1,310 \n1,176 \nNGL \n1,346\n \n1,509 \n4,000 \nTotal Midstream\n$\n2,638\n \n2,819 \n5,176 \nThousands of Barrels Daily\nTransportation Volumes\nPipelines*\n3,053\n \n3,069 \n3,089 \nTerminals\n3,123\n \n3,246 \n2,981 \nOperating Statistics\nWellhead Volume (billion cubic feet per day)**\n4.3\n \n4.6 \n4.4 \nNGL production**\n436\n \n437 \n423 \nPipeline Throughput–Y-Grade to Market***\n754\n \n707 \n704 \nNGL fractionated\n728\n \n711 \n529 \n* Pipelines represent the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed consolidated pipeline segment, excluding NGL’s pipelines.\n*\n* Includes 100% of DCP Midstream Class A Segment’s volumes from August 18, 2022, forward.\n*** Represents volumes delivered to major fractionation market hubs, including Mont Belvieu, Sweeny and Conway.  Includes 100% of DCP Midstream Class A Segment and Phillips 66’s direct interest in DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills.\nThe Midstream segment provides crude oil and refined petroleum product transportation, terminaling and processing services; NGL production, transportation, storage, fractionation, processing, marketing and export services; natural gas gathering, compressing, treating, processing, storage, transportation and marketing services; and condensate recovery.  \nIn connection with the DCP Midstream Merger, the results of our Transportation business reflect a decrease in our indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline to 6.5% from August 18, 2022, forward.  Prior to August 18, 2022, the Transportation results presented in the table above reflect Gray Oak Holdings’ 65% economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline.  In addition, the results of our NGL business include the consolidated results of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills from August 18, 2022, forward.  Prior to August 18, 2022, our investments in DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills were accounted for using the equity method and equity earnings from these investments were included in the results of our NGL business.\nIn the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, for additional information regarding the DCP Midstream Merger.\n55\n2024 vs. 2023 \nResults from our Midstream segment decreased $181 million in 2024, compared with 2023. \nResults from our Transportation business decreased $18 million in 2024, compared with 2023.  The decrease in 2024 was primarily due to before-tax impairments totaling $122 million, partially offset by an increase in before-tax gains on sales of assets.  We sold our ownership interest in REX in 2024 and recorded a before-tax gain of $238 million, compared to before-tax gains recorded in 2023 associated with the sales of our ownership interests in the South Texas Gateway Terminal and the Belle Chasse Terminal which totaled $137 million.  \nResults from our NGL business decreased $163 million in 2024, compared with 2023.  The decrease was primarily due to before-tax impairment charges recognized in 2024 associated with certain gathering and processing assets in Texas, as well as unfavorable pricing driven by falling natural gas prices and winter weather impacts.  These decreases were partially offset by improved pipeline volumes and higher liquefied petroleum gas cargo volumes and margins. \nSee Note 12—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding impairments.  See Note 9—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the sale of our ownership interest in REX.\nSee the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting 2024 results.\n2023 vs. 2022  \nResults from our Midstream segment decreased $2,357 million in 2023, compared with 2022. \nResults from our Transportation business increased $134 million in 2023, compared with 2022.  The increase in 2023 was primarily due to higher volumes and tariffs, as well as decreased operating costs, partially offset by lower before-tax gains on sales and transfers of interests in equity affiliates.  In August 2023, we recognized a $101 million before-tax gain on the sale of our 25% ownership interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal, while in August 2022, we recognized a before-tax gain of $182 million related to the transfer of an indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline as part of the DCP Midstream Merger.\nResults from our NGL business decreased $2,491 million in 2023, compared with 2022.  The decrease was primarily due to an aggregate before-tax gain of $2,831 million recognized in the third quarter of 2022 from remeasuring our previously held equity investments in DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills to their fair values in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger.  The decrease was partially offset by the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills from August 18, 2022, forward, as well as increased fractionation volumes at the Sweeny Hub reflecting the startup of Frac 4 in October 2022. \nSee Note 5—Business Combinations, and Note 19—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the before-tax gains recorded in connection with the DCP Midstream Merger.  \n56\nChemicals\n \n \nYear Ended December 31\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nMillions of Dollars\nIncome Before Income Taxes\n$\n876\n \n600 \n856 \n \nMillions of Pounds\nCPChem Externally Marketed Sales Volumes*\n24,088\n \n23,798 \n23,749 \n* Represents 100% of CPChem’s outside sales of produced petrochemical products, as well as commission sales from equity affiliates.\nOlefins and Polyolefins Capacity Utilization (percent)\n97\n \n%\n96 \n91 \nThe Chemicals segment consists of our 50% interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method.  CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals.  These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals.  CPChem produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products.  Ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe.  CPChem manufactures and/or markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, cyclohexane, styrene and polystyrene, as well as manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products.

During 2024, we generated $4.2 billion in cash from operations.  We funded capital expenditures and investments of $1.9 billion, completed acquisitions for cash consideration of $625 million, purchased government obligations of $1.1 billion that were ultimately used to extinguish debt, and received proceeds from asset dispositions of $1.1 billion.  Additionally, we received proceeds from debt issuances, net of debt repayments, of $2.1 billion.  We paid $3.5 billion to repurchase common stock and $1.9 billion to fund dividends on our common stock.  During 2024, cash and cash equivalents decreased $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion.  At this time, we believe that our cash on hand, as well as the sources of liquidity described herein, will be sufficient to fund our obligations over the short- and long-term. \nSignificant Sources of Capital\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2024, cash generated by operating activities was $4.2 billion, a $2.8 billion decrease compared with 2023.  The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings, driven by a decline in realized refining margins, partially offset by more favorable working capital impacts.\nDuring 2023, cash generated by operating activities was $7.0 billion, a $3.8 billion decrease compared with 2022.  The decrease was primarily due to lower realized refining margins, working capital impacts, reduced operating distributions from equity affiliates, completion of long-term crude oil exchanges and higher contributions to our pension plans. \nOur short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices and chemicals margins.  Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control.  Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. \nThe level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows.  Factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability, and weather conditions can affect output.  We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by fluctuations in margins and prices.  Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 95%, 92% and 90% in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Our worldwide refining clean product yield was 87%, 85% and 84% in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n64\nEquity Affiliate Operating Distributions\nOur operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates.  Over the three years ended December 31, 2024, operating cash flows included aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of $4.2 billion.  We cannot control the amount of future dividends from equity affiliates; therefore, future dividend payments by these equity affiliates are not assured.\nDebt Issuances\nOn September 9, 2024, Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, issued $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Phillips 66.  The senior unsecured notes issuance consisted of: \n•\n$600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250% Senior Notes due 2031 (Additional 2031 Notes).\n•\n$600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.950% Senior Notes due 2035 (2035 Notes).\n•\n$600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2055 (2055 Notes).\nInterest on the Additional 2031 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year and commenced on December 15, 2024.  Interest on the 2035 Notes and 2055 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, commencing on March 15, 2025.  \nOn February 28, 2024, Phillips 66 Company issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Phillips 66.  The senior unsecured notes issuance consisted of: \n•\n$600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250% Senior Notes due 2031 (2031 Notes).\n•\n$400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.300% Senior Notes due 2033 (Additional 2033 Notes).\n•\n$500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.650% Senior Notes due 2054 (2054 Notes).\nInterest on the 2031 Notes and 2054 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year and commenced on June 15, 2024.  Interest on the Additional 2033 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 30 of each year and commenced on June 30, 2024.  \nOn March 29, 2023, Phillips 66 Company issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Phillips 66.  The senior unsecured notes issuance consisted of:\n•\n$750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.950% Senior Notes due December 2027.\n•\n$500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.300% Senior Notes due June 2033.\nDischarge of Senior Notes\nOn September 20, 2024, we extinguished (i) the remaining $441 million outstanding principal amount of Phillips 66 Company’s 3.605% senior notes due February 2025 (2025 P66 Co Notes), and (ii) the remaining $650 million outstanding principal amount of Phillips 66’s 3.850% senior notes due April 2025 (the 2025 PSX Notes, and together with the 2025 P66 Co Notes, the Discharged Notes), whereby we irrevocably transferred a total of $1,100 million in government obligations to the trustee of the 2025 P66 Co Notes and the 2025 PSX Notes.  The cash paid to purchase the government obligations is included within investing cash flows on our consolidated statement of cash flows.  These government obligations will yield sufficient principal and interest over their remaining term to permit the trustee to satisfy the remaining principal and interest due on the Discharged Notes.  Phillips 66 and Phillips 66 Company are no longer the primary obligors under the Discharged Notes.  The transfer of the government obligations to the trustee was accounted for as a transfer of financial assets.  If the trustee is unable to apply the government obligations to fund the remaining principal and interest payments on the Discharged Notes, then the Company’s obligations under the Indenture with respect to the Discharged Notes will be revived and reinstated.  We deem the likelihood of such event to be remote with no impact to the legal isolation of the assets.  Accordingly, the senior notes and the government obligations were derecognized on our balance sheet at December 31, 2024.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized an immaterial gain on the extinguishment of this debt.\n65\nTerm Loan Agreement\nOn March 27, 2023, Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, entered into a $1.5 billion delayed draw term loan agreement guaranteed by Phillips 66 (the Term Loan Agreement).  The Term Loan Agreement provides for a single borrowing during a 90-day period commencing on the closing date, which borrowing was contingent upon the completion of the DCP LP Merger.  The Term Loan Agreement contains customary covenants similar to those contained in our revolving credit agreement, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.  The Term Loan Agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts after grace periods; and violation of covenants.  We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.  Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at either: (a) the adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate plus the applicable margin, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $550 million and $1.25 billion were borrowed under the Term Loan Agreement, which matures in June 2026, respectively.  \nRelated Party Advance Term Loan Agreements\nAt December 31, 2023, borrowings outstanding under our Advance Term Loan agreements with WRB totaled $290 million.  Borrowings under these agreements were due between 2035 and 2038 and bore interest at a floating rate based on an adjusted term SOFR plus an applicable margin, payable on the last day of each month.  On December 31, 2024, WRB distributed its Advance Term Loan with a principal balance of $290 million, including the right to receive any accrued but unpaid interest, to Phillips 66 Company, resulting in the reduction of our related party debt balance and our investment in WRB by $290 million.  The distribution was recognized as a non-cash investing and financing transaction.   \nAccounts Receivable Securitization\nOn September 30, 2024, Phillips 66 Company entered into a 364-day, $500 million accounts receivable securitization facility (the Receivables Securitization Facility).  Under the Receivables Securitization Facility, Phillips 66 Company sells or contributes on an ongoing basis, certain of its receivables, together with related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, to its wholly owned subsidiary, Phillips 66 Receivables LLC (P66 Receivables), a consolidated and bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity created for the sole purpose of transacting under the Receivables Securitization Facility.  Under the Receivables Securitization Facility, P66 Receivables may borrow and incur indebtedness from, and/or sell certain receivables in an amount not to exceed $500 million in the aggregate, and will secure its obligations with a pledge of undivided interests in such receivables, together with related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, to PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the secured parties thereunder.  Accounts outstanding under the Receivables Securitization Facility accrue interest at an adjusted SOFR plus the applicable margin.  In all instances, Phillips 66 Company retains the servicing of the accounts receivables transferred.\nP66 Receivables’ sole activity consists of purchasing receivables from Phillips 66 Company, providing those receivables as collateral for P66 Receivables’ borrowings or on-selling certain of its receivables under the Receivables Securitization Facility.  P66 Receivables is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors, who will be entitled, upon its liquidation, to be satisfied out of P66 Receivables’ assets prior to assets or value in P66 Receivables becoming available to P66 Receivables’ equity holders.  The assets of P66 Receivables, including any funds of P66 Receivables that may be commingled with funds of any of its affiliates for purposes of cash management and related efficiencies, are not available to pay creditors of Phillips 66 Company, Phillips 66 or any affiliate thereof.  Collections on receivables in excess of amounts owed by P66 Receivables under the Receivables Securitization Facility are available to P66 Receivables for payment to Phillips 66 Company, for sales of its receivables to P66 Receivables under the Receivables Securitization Facility, and otherwise for distribution to Phillips 66 Company, in each case, subject to the terms set forth in the Receivables Securitization Facility.  The amount available for borrowing or sale of receivables may be limited by the availability of eligible receivables and other customary factors and conditions, as well as the covenants set forth in the Receivables Securitization Facility.\n66\nSales of accounts receivables under the Receivables Securitization Facility meet the sale criteria under ASC 860, \nTransfers and Servicing, \nand are derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet.  P66 Receivables guarantees payment, in full, for accounts receivables sold to the purchasers.  Cash receipts from the sale of accounts receivables under the Receivables Securitization Facility, received at the time of sale, are classified as cash flows from operating activities. For the year-ended December 31, 2024, we sold $125 million of accounts receivables in exchange for a $125 million reduction in our borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility, which was recognized as a non-cash financing transaction.  We recognized an immaterial charge associated with the transfer of financial assets, which is included as a component within the line item “Selling, general and administrative expense” on our consolidated statement of income during the year ended December 31, 2024.  At December 31, 2024, $121 million of the sold accounts receivable remained outstanding, which represents our maximum potential future exposure under the guarantee.\nBorrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility are recognized as short-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.  Borrowings are secured by the accounts receivables, held by P66 Receivables, which remain reported as accounts receivables on the consolidated balance sheet.  At December 31, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of $375 million under the Receivables Securitization Facility, secured by approximately $4.6 billion of accounts receivable held by P66 Receivables.  \nAt December 31, 2024, we had no unused capacity under the Receivables Securitization Facility.\nCredit Facilities and Commercial Paper\nPhillips 66 and Phillips 66 Company\nOn January 13, 2025, we entered into a $200 million uncommitted credit facility (the 2025 Uncommitted Facility) with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor.  The 2025 Uncommitted Facility contains covenants and events of default customary for unsecured uncommitted facilities.  The 2025 Uncommitted Facility has no commitment fees or compensating balance requirements.  Outstanding borrowings under the 2025 Uncommitted Facility bear interest at a rate of either (a) the adjusted term SOFR plus the applicable margin, (b) the adjusted daily simple SOFR plus the applicable margin or (c) the base rate, in each case plus the applicable margin.  Each borrowing matures six months from the date of such borrowing.  We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. At February 21, 2025, no amount had been drawn under the 2025 Uncommitted Facility.\nOn June 25, 2024, we entered into a $400 million uncommitted credit facility (the 2024 Uncommitted Facility) with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor.  The 2024 Uncommitted Facility contains covenants and events of default customary for unsecured uncommitted facilities.  The 2024 Uncommitted Facility has no commitment fees or compensating balance requirements.  Outstanding borrowings under the 2024 Uncommitted Facility bear interest at a rate of either (a) the adjusted term SOFR, (b) the adjusted daily simple SOFR or (c) the reference rate, in each case plus the applicable margin.  Each borrowing matures six months from the date of such borrowing.  We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. At December 31, 2024, the entire $400 million had been drawn under the 2024 Uncommitted Facility.\n67\nOn February 28, 2024, we entered into a new $5 billion revolving credit agreement (the Facility) with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor and a scheduled maturity date of February 28, 2029.  The Facility replaced our previous $5 billion revolving credit facility dated as of June 23, 2022, with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor, and the previous revolving credit facility was terminated.  The Facility contains customary covenants similar to the previous revolving credit facility, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.  The Facility has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts after grace periods; and violation of covenants. We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings under the Facility, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.  We have the option to increase the overall capacity to $6 billion, subject to certain conditions.  We also have the option to extend the scheduled maturity of the Facility for up to two additional one-year terms, subject to, among other things, the consent of the lenders holding the majority of the commitments and of each lender extending its commitment.  Outstanding borrowings under the Facility bear interest at either: (a) the adjusted term SOFR (as described in the Facility) in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate (as described in the Facility) plus the applicable margin.  The pricing levels for the commitment fee and interest-rate margins are determined based on the ratings in effect for our senior unsecured long-term debt from time to time.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, no amounts were drawn under the Facility or the previous revolving credit facility, respectively.\nPhillips 66 also has a $5 billion uncommitted commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs that is supported by the Facility.  Commercial paper maturities are contractually limited to less than one year.  At December 31, 2024, $435 million of commercial paper had been issued under this program.  At December 31, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under this program. \nDCP Midstream Class A Segment\nOn March 15, 2024, DCP LP terminated its $1.4 billion credit facility and its accounts receivable securitization facility that previously provided for up to $350 million of borrowing capacity.  At December 31, 2023, DCP LP had $25 million in borrowings outstanding under its $1.4 billion credit facility and $350 million of borrowings outstanding under its accounts receivable securitization facility, both of which were repaid during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nTotal Committed Capacity Available\nAt December 31, 2024, and 2023, we had $4.6 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, of total committed capacity available under the credit facilities described above. \nAsset & Investment Dispositions\nOn December 10, 2024, we sold our equity interests in certain pipeline and terminaling assets in North Dakota for cash proceeds of approximately $143 million.\nOn August 30, 2024, we sold certain Midstream gathering and processing assets in Texas for cash proceeds of $41 million.\nOn August 1, 2024, we sold our ownership interests in certain gathering and processing assets in Louisiana and Alabama for cash proceeds of $173 million.\nOn June 14, 2024, we sold our 25% ownership interest in REX for cash proceeds of $685 million.\nOn August 1, 2023, we sold our 25% ownership interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal for approximately $275 million.\nOn February 28, 2023, we sold the Belle Chasse Terminal for approximately $76 million. \n68\nSubsequent Investment Dispositions\nOn January 30, 2025, we sold our 25% ownership interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline LLC for cash proceeds of $853 million.  \nOn January 31, 2025, we sold our 49% ownership interest in Coop.  We received cash proceeds of 1.06 billion Swiss francs, consisting of a sales price of approximately 977 million Swiss francs and a final dividend relating to financial year 2024 of 83 million Swiss francs from Coop that was paid on January 30, 2025.  We also settled the foreign currency forward contracts entered into in connection with the asset sale, in which we sold 1.06 billion Swiss francs in exchange for $1.24 billion U.S. dollars.  \nSee Note 9—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables and Note 10—Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding asset and investment dispositions.\nPhillips 66 Availability of Debt Financing\nWe have an A3 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service and a BBB+ credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s.  These investment grade ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders.  We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a rating downgrade by one or both rating agencies.  Failure to maintain investment grade ratings could prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, although we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.\nDCP LP Availability of Debt Financing\nDCP LP has a Baa3 credit rating, with a positive outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service and a BBB+ credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard and Poor’s.  These ratings facilitate DCP LP’s access to a variety of lenders.  DCP LP does not have any ratings triggers on any of its corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact access to liquidity, in the event of a rating downgrade by one or more rating agencies.\n69\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nLease Residual Value Guarantees\nUnder the operating lease agreement for our headquarters facility in Houston, Texas, we have the option, at the end of the lease term in September 2025, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility or assist the lessor in marketing it for resale.  We have a residual value guarantee associated with the operating lease agreement with a maximum potential future exposure of $514 million at December 31, 2024.  We also have residual value guarantees associated with railcar, airplane and truck leases with maximum potential future exposures totaling $175 million.  These leases have remaining terms of one to ten years.\nDakota Access, LLC (Dakota Access) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCO)\nIn 2020, the trial court presiding over litigation brought by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (the Tribe) ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) addressing an easement under Lake Oahe in North Dakota.  The trial court later vacated the easement.  Although the easement is vacated, the USACE has no plans to stop pipeline operations while it proceeds with the EIS, and the Tribe’s request for a shutdown was denied in May 2021.  In June 2021, the trial court dismissed the litigation entirely.  Once the EIS is completed, new litigation or challenges may be filed.  \nIn February 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court (the Supreme Court) denied Dakota Access’ writ of certiorari requesting the Supreme Court to review the trial court’s decision to order the EIS and vacate the easement.  Therefore, the requirement to prepare the EIS stood.  Also in February 2022, the Tribe withdrew as a cooperating agency, causing the USACE to halt the EIS process while the USACE engaged with the Tribe on their reasons for withdrawing.  \nThe draft EIS process resumed in August 2022, and in September 2023, the USACE published its draft EIS for public comment.  The USACE identified five potential outcomes but did not indicate which one it preferred.  The options comprise two “no action” alternatives where the USACE would deny an easement to Dakota Access and require it to shut down the pipeline and either remove the pipe from under Lake Oahe or allow the pipeline to be abandoned-in-place under the lake.  The USACE also identified three “action” alternatives; two of them contemplate that the USACE would reissue the easement to Dakota Access under essentially the same terms as 2017 with either the same or a larger volume of oil allowed through the pipeline, while the third alternative would require decommissioning of the current pipeline and construction of a new line 39 miles upstream from the current location. \nThe public comment period concluded on December 13, 2023.  The USACE plans to review the comments and issue its final EIS in early 2026.  The Record of Decision will follow within 30 to 60 days after the issuance of the final EIS.  The final EIS must be completed before the USACE can reauthorize the easement for the pipeline.  If reauthorization occurs, new litigation challenging the reauthorization may be filed. \nIn October 2024, the Tribe filed another lawsuit against the USACE in federal district court in Washington, D.C., again challenging USACE’s allowance of pipeline operations while the EIS process proceeds.  In this lawsuit, the Tribe purports to introduce new evidence regarding the pipeline’s proximity to a reservoir and attempts to relitigate arguments about the need for injunctive relief to support its position that the Supreme Court should halt pipeline operations.  A consortium of 13 states has joined Dakota Access as intervenors.  The consortium argues that the pipeline reduces pollution compared to other modes of transportation and that Dakota Access is integral to the health of regional energy and agriculture markets.  The Tribe’s prior request for a shutdown was denied in May 2021.  This latest lawsuit seeking a shutdown does not change the current deadline for the issuance of the final EIS.\nDakota Access and ETCO have guaranteed repayment of senior unsecured notes issued by a wholly owned subsidiary of Dakota Access.  On April 1, 2024, Dakota Access’ wholly owned subsidiary repaid $1 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior notes upon maturity.  We funded our 25% share of the repayment, or $250 million, with a capital contribution of $171 million in March 2024 and $79 million of distributions we elected not to receive from Dakota Access in the first quarter of 2024.  At December 31, 2024, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of Dakota Access’ senior unsecured notes was $850 million.\n70\nIn addition, Phillips 66 Partners and its co-venturers in Dakota Access also provided a Contingent Equity Contribution Undertaking (CECU) in conjunction with the notes offering.  Under the CECU, the co-venturers may be severally required to make proportionate equity contributions to Dakota Access if there is an unfavorable final judgment in the above-mentioned ongoing litigation.  At December 31, 2024, our 25% share of the maximum potential equity contributions under the CECU was approximately $215 million.  If the pipeline is required to cease operations, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  Should operations cease and Dakota Access and ETCO not have sufficient funds to pay its expenses, we also could be required to support our 25% share of the ongoing expenses, including scheduled interest payments on the notes of approximately $10 million annually, in addition to the potential obligations under the CECU at December 31, 2024.\nSee Note 9—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial statements for additional information regarding our investments in Dakota Access and ETCO.  See Note 16—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding guarantees.\n71\nCapital Requirements\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section below.  \nDebt Financing\nOur debt balance at December 31, 2024, was $20.1 billion and our total debt-to-capital ratio was 41%.  See Note 15—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our annual debt maturities over the next five years and more information on debt repayments.\nRepayments\nOn December 16, 2024, upon maturity, Phillips 66 Company and Phillips 66 Partners repaid the 2.450% Senior Notes due December 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of $300 million. \nOn March 29, 2024, DCP LP redeemed $300 million of its 5.375% Senior Notes due July 2025.  After the redemption, an aggregate principal amount of $525 million remained outstanding.  \nOn March 4, 2024, Phillips 66 Company repaid $700 million of the $1.25 billion borrowed under its delayed draw term loan that matures in June 2026. \nOn February 15, 2024, upon maturity, Phillips 66 repaid its 0.900% senior notes due February 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of $800 million.\nDCP LP Cash Distributions to Unitholders\nDCP LP’s partnership agreement requires it to distribute all available cash within 45 days after the end of each quarter.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, DCP LP made cash distributions of $47 million to common unitholders other than Phillips 66 and its subsidiaries.  See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Midstream, LP Mergers, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the DCP LP public common unit acquisition.\nAcquisitions\nOn October 1, 2024, we acquired a marketing business on the U.S. West Coast in our M&S segment for total consideration of $65 million.  These operations were acquired to support the placement of renewable diesel produced by the Rodeo Complex.  \nOn July 1, 2024, we acquired Pinnacle Midstream in our Midstream segment to expand our natural gas gathering and processing operations in the Permian Basin for cash consideration of $565 million.  \nMidstream Pending Acquisition\nOn January 6, 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all issued and outstanding equity interests in each of EPIC Y-Grade GP, LLC (Y-Grade GP) and EPIC Y-Grade, LP (Y-Grade LP, and, together with Y-Grade GP and their respective subsidiaries, EPIC Y-Grade), which own various long haul natural gas liquids pipelines, fractionation facilities and distribution systems, for cash consideration of $2.2 billion, subject to certain closing adjustments.  The closing date of this transaction is dependent on regulatory approval and completion of other customary closing conditions.    \nDividends\nOn February 12, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.15 per common share.  The dividend is payable March 5, 2025, to holders of record at the close of business on February 24, 2025.  \nShare Repurchases\nSince July 2012, our Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate of $25 billion of repurchases of our outstanding common stock, and we have repurchased 238 million shares at an aggregate cost of $21.5 billion.  In 2024, we repurchased 24.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $3.4 billion.  Our share repurchase authorizations do not expire.  Any future share repurchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend on various factors including our share price, results of operations, financial condition and cash required for future business plans.  Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.  \n72\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations primarily consist of purchase obligations, outstanding debt principal and interest obligations, operating and finance lease obligations, and asset retirement and environmental obligations.\nPurchase Obligations\nOur purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms.  We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled with operating cash flows in the period when due.  At December 31, 2024, our purchase obligations totaled $85.3 billion, with $31.2 billion due within one year.  \nThe majority of our purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of commodities such as crude oil and NGL.  The commodities are used to supply our refineries and fractionators and optimize our supply chain.  At December 31, 2024, commodity purchase commitments with third parties and related parties were $47.4 billion and $24.9 billion, respectively.  The remaining purchase obligations mainly represent agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products, and our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.  \nDebt Principal and Interest Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2024, our aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt was $20.2 billion, with $1.8 billion due within one year.  Our obligations for interest on the debt totaled $10.6 billion, with $925 million due within one year.  See Note 15—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our outstanding debt principal and interest obligations. \nFinance and Operating Lease Obligations\nSee Note 21—Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our lease obligations and timing of our expected lease payments.\nAsset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\nSee Note 13—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding asset retirement and environmental obligations.\n73\nCapital Spending\n \nOur capital expenditures and investments represent consolidated capital spending.\n \nMillions of Dollars\n \n2025\nBudget\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCapital Expenditures and Investments*\nMidstream**\n$\n975 \n751\n \n625 \n737 \nChemicals\n— \n—\n \n— \n— \nRefining\n822 \n582\n \n586 \n607 \nMarketing and Specialties\n154 \n85\n \n101 \n87 \nRenewable Fuels\n74 \n375\n \n753 \n323 \nCorporate and Other\n75 \n66\n \n90 \n134 \nTotal Capital Expenditures and Investments\n$\n2,100 \n1,859\n \n2,155 \n1,888 \nSelected Equity Affiliates***\nCPChem\n$\n714 \n809\n \n1,009 \n701 \nWRB\n171 \n121\n \n189 \n177 \nTotal Selected Equity Affiliates\n$\n885 \n930\n \n1,198 \n878 \n* In the third quarter of 2024, we began presenting the line item “Capital expenditures and investments” on our consolidated statement of cash flows exclusive of acquisitions, net of cash acquired.  Prior period information has been reclassified for comparability.  Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were $625 million, $263 million and $306 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n** Includes 100% of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills capital expenditures and investments from August 18, 2022,                                                    forward. \n*** Our share of joint ventures’ capital spending.\nMidstream\nCapital spending in our Midstream segment was $2.1 billion for the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, including:\n•\nExpansion of gathering and processing systems in the Denver-Julesburg Basin and the Permian Basin.\n•\nContributions to Dakota Access for a pipeline optimization project, including a contribution to fund our 25% share of Dakota Access’ debt repayment. \n•\nContinued development and expansion of fractionation capacity at our Sweeny Hub.  \n•\nSpending associated with other return, reliability, and maintenance projects in our Transportation and NGL businesses. \nChemicals\nDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, CPChem had a self-funded capital program that totaled $5 billion on a 100% basis.  Capital spending was primarily for the development of petrochemical projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Middle East, as well as sustaining, debottlenecking and optimization projects on existing assets.\n74\nRefining\nCapital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, was $1.8 billion, primarily for projects to enhance the yield of higher-value products and sustain the reliability and safety of our refineries.  \nKey projects funded during the three-year period included:\n•\nInstallation of facilities to improve market capture at our refineries.\n•\nInstallation of facilities to improve utilization and product value at our refineries.\n•\nCapital spending to improve reliability at our refineries.\nMarketing and Specialties\nCapital spending for the M&S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, was $273 million, primarily for the continued development and enhancement of retail sites in Europe, spend associated with marketing and commercial fleet fueling businesses on the U.S. West Coast, marketing-related information technology enhancements, and reliability and maintenance projects for our Specialties business.  \nRenewable Fuels\nCapital spending for the Renewable Fuels segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, was $1.5 billion, primarily related to the construction of facilities to produce renewable fuels at the Rodeo Complex.\nCorporate and Other\nCapital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, was $290 million, primarily related to information technology and facilities.\n2025 Budget\nOur 2025 capital budget is $2.1 billion, including $998 million for sustaining capital and $1.1 billion for growth capital.  Our projected $2.1 billion capital budget excludes our portion of planned capital spending by our major joint ventures CPChem and WRB totaling $885 million and acquisitions, including the pending acquisition of EPIC Y-Grade, which is subject to regulatory approval and completion of other customary closing conditions.  See Note 5—Business Combinations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the pending acquisition of EPIC Y-Grade.\nThe Midstream capital budget of $975 million comprises $429 million for sustaining projects and $546 million for growth projects.  The Midstream capital budget advances the integrated NGL wellhead-to-market value chain by strengthening our position in key basins, including by increasing gas processing capacity.  In Refining, we plan to invest $822 million, including $414 million for sustaining capital.  Refining growth capital of $408 million supports high-return, low-capital projects that will increase asset reliability and improve market capture.  The M&S capital budget of $154 million reflects the continued enhancement of our branded network.  The Renewable Fuels capital budget of $74 million reflects investments at the Rodeo Complex related to feedstock optimization and logistics for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel production.  The Corporate and Other capital budget of $75 million will primarily fund information technology projects.\n75\nContingencies\nA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us.  We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites.  We regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies.  In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable.  If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued.  We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries.  If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.  In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is uncertain.\nOther than with respect to the legal matters described herein, based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.  As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures.  Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters.  Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties.  Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.\nLegal and Tax Matters\nOur legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations, respectively.  These organizations apply their knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions.  We employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor legal proceedings.  Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation.  Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.  In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we monitor tax legislation and court decisions, the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability.\n76\nPropel Fuels Litigation\nIn late 2017, as part of Phillips 66 Company’s evaluation of various opportunities in the renewable fuels business, Phillips 66 Company engaged with Propel Fuels, a California company that distributes E85 and other alternative fuels through fueling kiosks.  Ultimately, the parties were not able to reach an agreement and negotiations were terminated in August 2018.  On February 17, 2022, Propel Fuels filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, County of Alameda (the Propel Court), alleging that Phillips 66 Company misappropriated trade secrets related to Propel Fuels’ renewable fuels business during and after due diligence.  On October 16, 2024, a jury returned a verdict against Phillips 66 Company for $604.9 million in compensatory damages and issued a willfulness finding.  In 2025, the Propel Court is expected to rule on motions anticipated to be filed by Propel Fuels seeking exemplary damages and attorneys’ fees.  Propel Fuels has asked the Propel Court to grant treble damages and Phillips 66 Company has filed a brief in opposition to that request.  Also in 2025, the Propel Court is expected to rule on Phillips 66 Company’s motions for a judgment in its favor as a matter of law, or in the alternative to reduce the jury’s verdict or to grant a new trial.  Phillips 66 Company denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend its position.  As a result of the jury verdict, the Company has recorded an accrual of $604.9 million which is included in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2024, and is reported in the M&S segment.  In addition, the accrued amount is reflected as “Other liabilities and deferred credits” on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.  However, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of the loss could change based on the progression of the case, including the appeals process.  Because of the uncertainties associated with ongoing litigation, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss that may be attributable to exemplary damages, if any, in excess of the amount accrued.  If information were to become available that would allow us to reasonably estimate a range of potential exposure in an amount higher or lower than the amount already accrued, we would adjust our accrued liabilities accordingly.  While Phillips 66 Company believes the jury verdict is not legally or factually supported and intends to pursue post-judgment remedies and file an appeal, there can be no assurances that such defense efforts will be successful.  To the extent Phillips 66 Company is required to pay exemplary damages, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nEnvironmental\nWe are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  Among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the:\n•\nU.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.\n•\nU.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into bodies of water.\n•\nEuropean Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (EU REACH), which governs production, marketing and use of chemicals and the United Kingdom’s legislation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, which replaced EU REACH in the United Kingdom in 2021 following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (BREXIT). \n•\nU.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.\n•\nU.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.\n•\nU.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.\n•\nU.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990, under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of crude oil into navigable waters of the United States.\n•\nEuropean Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as the United Kingdom Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), which replaced the EU ETS in the United Kingdom in 2021, following BREXIT. \n77\nThese laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits.  They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations.  These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming.  In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application.  Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.\nOther countries and many states where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities.  While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders.  For example, in California the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) approved amendments to the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) that became effective in 2016, which required a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022, affecting refineries in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.  In 2017, SCAQMD required additional nitrogen oxide emissions reductions through 2025 and, on November 5, 2021, promulgated new regulations to replace the RECLAIM program with a traditional command and control regulatory regime.\nThe ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emissions standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve.  However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate.  Notable areas of potential impacts include air emissions compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.\nAn example of this in the fuels area is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA).  The law requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types.  Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) form the mechanism used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to record compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).  If an obligated party has more RINs than it needs to meet its obligation, it may sell or trade the extra RINs, or instead choose to “bank” them for use the following year.  We have met the EPA’s renewable volume obligations (RVO) to date.  These obligations have been met using a variety of operating and capital strategies.  We are also implementing advanced and different technologies to address projected future RVOs.  On June 21, 2023, the EPA finalized RVO for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 compliance years.  These standards increase cellulosic volumes, which reflect the EPA’s forecast for increasing compressed natural gas and NGL volumes derived from biogas.  In addition, the EPA increased total advanced biofuel volumes from the 5.63 billion gallons established for the 2022 compliance year to 7.33 billion gallons in 2025.  We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products and increased program costs if not fully recovered in the market.  This program continues to be the subject of possible Congressional review and re-promulgation in revised form, and the EPA’s final regulations establishing RVO requirements have been and continue to be subject to legal challenge, further creating uncertainty regarding RVO requirements.\nWe are required to purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy the portion of our obligation under the RFS that is not fulfilled by blending renewable fuels into the motor fuels we produce.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, we were able to fully satisfy our obligations under the RFS through blending renewable fuels into the motor fuel we produce.  For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred expenses of $323 million and $478 million, respectively, associated with our obligation to purchase RINs in the open market to comply with the RFS for our wholly owned refineries.  These expenses are included in the “Purchased crude oil and products” line item on our consolidated statement of income.  Our jointly owned refineries also incurred expenses associated with the purchase of RINs in the open market, of which our share was $255 million, $389 million and $437 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  These expenses are included in the “Equity in earnings of affiliates” line item on our consolidated statement of income.  The amount of these expenses and fluctuations between periods is primarily driven by the market price of RINs, refinery and renewable fuels production, blending activities, and RVO requirements.\n78\nWe also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations, including CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents.  Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States.  Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards.  In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether for soil and groundwater and both the EPA and many states may adopt cleanup standards for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, which may have been a constituent in certain firefighting foams used or stored at or near some of our facilities.\nAt RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions.  If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations.  In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs is typically borne solely by us.  We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years.  Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.\nWe occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute.  On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties.  These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations.  At December 31, 2023, we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 21 sites within the United States.  During 2024, our legal organization approved the removal of two sites, which left 19 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2024.\nFor the majority of Superfund sites, our potential liability will be less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low.  Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially.  Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned.  Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.  In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability.  Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain the EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan.  There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.\nWe incur costs related to the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of environmental pollution.  Expensed environmental costs were $849 million in 2024 and are expected to be approximately $923 million and $791 million in 2025 and 2026, respectively.  Capitalized environmental costs were $111 million in 2024 and are expected to be approximately $168 million and $231 million, in 2025 and 2026, respectively.  These amounts do not include capital expenditures made for other purposes that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance. \nAccrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).\n79\nMany of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations, or at sites where our generated waste was disposed.  We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities.  If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.  In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA.  Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties.  Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that those costs and liabilities will not be material.  However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.\nClimate Change\nThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG emissions reduction, including various regulations proposed or issued by the EPA.  These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states and/or countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future.  Laws regulating GHG emissions continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance, lengthening project implementation and agency reviews, or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products.  Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:\n \n•\nEU ETS, which is part of the European Union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial GHG emissions.  EU ETS impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all EU member states.  As a result of BREXIT, those types of entities in the United Kingdom are now subject to the UK ETS, rather than the EU ETS.\n•\nEU Renewable Energy Directive II, which increases the EU’s energy consumption from renewable sources in the electricity, heat, and transportation sectors to 32% by 2030. \n•\nUnited Kingdom’s Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, which is intended to reduce the GHG emissions from fuel used in the United Kingdom transportation sector by encouraging the supply of renewable fuels. \n•\nCalifornia’s Senate Bill No. 32, which requires reduction of California's GHG emissions to 40% below the 1990 emission level by 2030, and Assembly Bill 398, which extends the California GHG emission cap and trade program through 2030.  Other GHG emissions programs in states in the western U.S. have been enacted or are under consideration or development, including amendments to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, California’s Advanced Clean Cars and Trucks Programs, California’s Carbon Neutrality by 2045 Scoping Plan, Oregon's Low Carbon Fuel Standard and Climate Protection Plan, and Washington's carbon reduction programs.\n•\nUnited States’ Inflation Reduction Act, which contains tax inducements and other provisions that incentivize investment, development, and deployment of alternative energy sources and technologies, which is intended to accelerate the energy transition.\n•\nThe Supreme Court decision in \nMassachusetts v. EPA\n, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.\n•\nThe EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act.  These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. \n80\n•\nThe EPA's 2015 Final Rule regulating GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electrical generating units under the Federal Clean Air Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan.  The EPA commenced rulemaking in 2017 to rescind the Clean Power Plan and, in August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule as its replacement.  On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia invalidated the ACE rule and remanded the matter to the EPA, essentially restarting this rulemaking process. \n•\nCarbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.\n•\nGHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions.\nIn the EU, the first phase of the EU ETS completed at the end of 2007.  Phase II was undertaken from 2008 through 2012, and Phase III ran from 2013 through to 2020.  Phase IV runs from January 1, 2021 through 2030 and sectors covered under the ETS must reduce their GHG emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels and there is agreement between the EU Member States, the European Parliament, and the EU Commission (which is pending ratification by the EU Council and European Parliament) to increase the Phase IV GHG emissions reduction to 63% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.  The United Kingdom is no longer part of the EU ETS and, instead, has been under the UK ETS since 2021.  Phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the EU ETS and assets that are subject to the UK ETS.\nFrom November 30 to December 12, 2015, more than 190 countries, including the United States, participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France.  The conference culminated in what is known as the “Paris Agreement,” which, upon certain conditions being met, entered into force on November 4, 2016.  The Paris Agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic GHG emission reductions.  In January 2025, President Trump signed an executive order directing the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and it is expected that President Trump and the Republican-led Congress will diverge from the previous administration’s positions and GHG commitments.  However, future emission reduction targets and other provisions of legislative or regulatory initiatives and policies enacted in the future by the United States could be brought by future administrations or, in the absence of federal action, states may become more active and focused on taking legislative or regulatory actions aimed at climate change and minimizing GHG emissions.\nIn the United States, some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming, particularly at the state level in the absence of federal action, with respect to GHG emissions.  Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in additional financial burden in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. \nCompliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading program, GHG reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation.  Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources.  \nAn example of one such program is California’s cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State’s Global Warming Solutions Act.  The program had been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in January 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California.  Inclusion of transportation fuels in California’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs.  Additionally, certain states have recently passed legislation seeking to recover financial damages allegedly associated with climate change from fossil fuel companies like the Vermont Climate Superfund Act passed by the Vermont Legislature in May 2024.  While such novel laws and implementing regulations may be subject to legal challenges, additional states may follow suit.  The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nWhether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.\n•\nThe nature of the legislation or regulation, such as a cap and trade system, a tax on emissions or financial damages.\n•\nThe GHG reductions required.\n81\n•\nThe price and availability of offsets.\n•\nThe demand for, amount and allocation of allowances.\n•\nTechnological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.\n•\nAny potential significant physical effects of climate change, such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature.\n•\nWhether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.\nWe consider and take into account anticipated future GHG emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects, and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce GHG emissions.  Data on our GHG emissions, legal requirements regulating such emissions, and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning, investment, and risk management decision-making.  We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation efforts throughout our operations.\nIn February 2022, we announced a target to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity related to our operations by 50% of 2019 levels by the year 2050.  The 2050 target builds upon our 2030 GHG emissions intensity targets to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from our operations by 30% and Scope 3 emissions from our energy products by 15% compared to 2019 levels.\nIn addition to the disclosures above, we have issued our 2024 Sustainability and People Report that is accessible on our website and provides more detailed information regarding our environmental, social and governance and human capital initiatives, including information on environmental metrics and other topics of interest to our stakeholders, which may not be considered material for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting purposes.   The information contained in the Sustainability and People Report is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Annual Report.\n82\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of our major accounting policies.  Some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used.  The following discussion of critical accounting estimates addresses accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.\nBusiness Combination\nIn accounting for a business combination, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition.  The excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively.  A significant amount of judgment is made in estimating the individual fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, noncontrolling interests and other assets and liabilities.  We use available information to make these fair value determinations and engage third-party specialists in the valuation process as necessary.\nThe fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity specific differences.  The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain.  Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the estimated results used to determine fair value.\nSee Note 5—Business Combinations, and Note 19—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our acquisitions.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments\nLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows.  If the sum of the undiscounted expected future before-tax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value.  Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets.  Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple for similar assets; historical market transactions including similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary; or replacement cost adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence.  The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments, including future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.\n83\nInvestments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount.  When it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value.  When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery.  When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, if appropriate.  Different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.\nSee Note 12—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about impairments.\n84\nGUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nWe have various cross guarantees between Phillips 66 and its wholly owned subsidiary Phillips 66 Company (together, the Obligor Group) with respect to publicly held debt securities.  Phillips 66 conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries, including Phillips 66 Company, and those subsidiaries generate substantially all of its operating income and cash flow.  Phillips 66 has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of Phillips 66 Company with respect to its publicly held debt securities.  In addition, Phillips 66 Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of Phillips 66 with respect to its publicly held debt securities.  All guarantees are full and unconditional.  At December 31, 2024, $14.4 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding has been guaranteed by the Obligor Group.\nSummarized financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis.  Intercompany transactions among the members of the Obligor Group have been eliminated.  The financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries has been excluded from the summarized financial information.  Significant intercompany transactions and receivable/payable balances between the Obligor Group and non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented separately in the summarized financial information.\n85\nThe summarized results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the summarized financial position at December 31, 2024, of the Obligor Group on a combined basis were:\nSummarized Combined Statement of Income\nMillions of Dollars\nSales and other operating revenues\n$\n108,141\n \nRevenues and other income—non-guarantor subsidiaries\n11,576\n \nPurchased crude oil and products—third parties\n64,734\n \nPurchased crude oil and products—related parties\n20,519\n \nPurchased crude oil and products—non-guarantor subsidiaries\n27,748\n \nLoss before income taxes\n(747)\nNet loss\n(533)\nSummarized Combined Balance Sheet\nMillions of Dollars\nAccounts and notes receivable—third parties\n$\n1,229\n \nAccounts and notes receivable—related parties\n1,422\n \nDue from non-guarantor subsidiaries, current\n3,102\n \nTotal current assets\n10,228\n \nInvestments and long-term receivables \n10,640\n \nNet properties, plants and equipment\n12,186\n \nGoodwill\n1,047\n \nDue from non-guarantor subsidiaries, noncurrent\n1,171\n \nOther assets associated with non-guarantor subsidiaries\n1,306\n \nTotal noncurrent assets\n28,380\n \nTotal assets\n38,608\n \nDue to non-guarantor subsidiaries, current\n$\n5,398\n \nTotal current liabilities\n14,236\n \nLong-term debt\n14,969\n \nDue to non-guarantor subsidiaries, noncurrent \n8,319\n \nTotal noncurrent liabilities\n29,640\n \nTotal liabilities\n43,876\n \nTotal equity\n(5,268)\nTotal liabilities and equity\n38,608\n \n86\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS\nRefining\nOur realized refining margins measure the difference between (a) sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of petroleum products manufactured at our refineries and (b) costs of feedstocks, primarily crude oil, used to produce the petroleum products.  The realized refining margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint venture refineries’ realized margins, as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.”  The realized refining margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs (primarily crude oil) measured on a barrel basis, including our share of inputs processed by our joint venture refineries.  Our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins, which are known as “crack spreads.”  As discussed in “Executive Overview and Business Environment—Business Environment,” industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil.  We believe realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry refining margins.\nThe GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the Refining segment’s “income (loss) before income taxes per barrel.”  Realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income (loss) before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses.  It also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries’ realized refining margins and excludes special items.

The realized marketing fuel margins are adjusted to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.”  The realized marketing fuel margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by sales volumes measured on a barrel basis.  We believe realized marketing fuel margin per barrel demonstrates the value uplift our marketing operations provide by optimizing the placement and ultimate sale of our facilities’ fuel production.\nWithin the M&S segment, the GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized marketing fuel margin per barrel is the marketing business’ “income before income taxes per barrel.”  Realized marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses.  Because realized marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes these items, and because realized marketing fuel margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool.
