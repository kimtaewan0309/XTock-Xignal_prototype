MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness overview \nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand Kellanova, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 1 of this report. Our MD&A references consumption and net sales in discussing our sales trends for certain categories and brands.  We record net sales upon delivery of shipments to our customers.  Consumption and share data noted within is based on Nielsen x-AOC or other comparable source, for the applicable period. Consumption refers to consumer purchases of our products from our customers. Unless otherwise noted, consumption and shipment trends are materially consistent.\nConsumers count on Kellanova for great-tasting, high-quality and nutritious foods. Currently, these foods include snacks, such as crackers, savory snacks, toaster pastries, cereal bars and bites; and convenience foods, such as, ready-to-eat cereals, frozen waffles, veggie foods and noodles. Kellanova products are manufactured and marketed globally.  \nProposed merger\nOn August 13, 2024, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which (and subject to the terms and conditions in the Merger Agreement) Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation. Each share of public common stock, par value $0.25 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned by (i) the Company or its subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries (including Acquiror and its subsidiaries) or (ii) stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive $83.50 per share in cash, without interest.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of antitrust approval from the EC.\n \nShareowner approval of the Merger Agreement, and all other regulatory approvals required to complete the Merger have been obtained. Based on the expected timeline of the EC’s ongoing investigation into the Merger, the Company expects the Merger to close towards the end of 2025; however, the exact timing of the completion of the Merger, if at all, cannot be predicted with any certainty.\nFor further discussion about the Merger, see Note 1 Accounting Policies - Proposed Merger, our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 14, 2024, June 25, 2025 and June 26, 2025, and our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on September 26, 2024. See the section titled, “Risk Factors” included under Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024 filed with the SEC on February 21, 2025 for more information regarding risks associated with the Merger.\nSegments\nWe manage our operations through four operating segments that are based primarily on geographic location – North America which includes the U.S. businesses and Canada; Europe which consists principally of European countries; Latin America which consists of Central and South America and includes Mexico; and AMEA (Asia Middle East Africa) which consists of Africa, Middle East, Australia and other Asian and Pacific markets. These operating segments also represent our reportable segments. \nNon-GAAP financial measures\nThis filing includes non-GAAP financial measures that we provide to management and investors that exclude certain items that we do not consider part of on-going operations. Items excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are discussed in the \"Significant items impacting comparability\" section of this filing. Our management team consistently utilizes a combination of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate business results, to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions, including incentive compensation. As a result, we believe the presentation of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our management team and improves investors’ understanding of our underlying operating performance and in their analysis of ongoing operating trends. All historic non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. \n26\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP financial measures used for evaluation of performance include currency-neutral and organic net sales, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), currency-neutral adjusted gross profit, currency neutral adjusted gross margin, adjusted effective tax rate, net debt, and free cash flow. We determine currency-neutral results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\n•\nCurrency-neutral net sales and organic net sales\n: We adjust the GAAP financial measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral net sales. In addition, we exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency, resulting in organic net sales. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying net sales performance. By providing these non-GAAP net sales measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of net sales performance for the Company and each of our reportable segments for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives behind net sales growth, pricing realization, and the impact of mix on our business results. These non-GAAP measures are also used to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions. \n•\nAdjusted: gross profit, gross margin, operating profit, operating margin, and diluted EPS:\n We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, costs of the separation transaction, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments and certain foreign currency contracts, and other costs impacting comparability resulting in adjusted. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's profitability measures for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments. \n•\nCurrency-neutral adjusted: gross profit, gross margin, operating profit, operating margin, and diluted EPS:\n We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, costs of the separation transaction, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments and certain foreign currency contracts, other costs impacting comparability, and foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral adjusted. We excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's profitability measures for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments. \n•\nAdjusted effective income tax rate:\n We adjust the GAAP financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, costs of the separation transaction, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments and certain foreign currency contracts, and other costs impacting comparability\n. \nWe excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our pre-tax income and the related tax effect of those items on our adjusted effective income tax rate, and other impacts to tax expense. By providing this non-GAAP measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's effective tax rate, excluding the pre-tax income and tax effect of the items noted above, for the periods presented. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to monitor the effectiveness of initiatives in place to optimize our global tax rate.\n•\nNet debt\n: Defined as the sum of long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable, less cash and cash equivalents. With respect to net debt, cash and cash equivalents are subtracted from the GAAP measure, total debt liabilities, because they could be used to reduce the Company’s debt obligations. Company management and investors use this non-GAAP measure to evaluate changes to the Company's capital structure and credit quality assessment.\n27\nTable of Contents\n•\nFree cash flow:\n Defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases once all of the Company’s business needs and obligations are met. Additionally, certain performance-based compensation includes a component of this non-GAAP measure.\nThese measures have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.\nSignificant items impacting comparability\nMark-to-market \nWe recognize mark-to-market adjustments for pension and postretirement benefit plans, commodity contracts, and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred. Actuarial gains/losses for pension plans are recognized in the year they occur. \nMark-to-market gains/losses for certain equity investments are recorded based on observable price changes.\n Changes between contract and market prices for commodity contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gains/losses that are recognized in the quarter they occur.  We recorded a pre-tax mark-to-market gain of $7 million and loss of $10 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 27, 2025, respectively. We recorded a pre-tax mark-to-market gain of $60 million and $82 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 28, 2024, respectively.  \nSeparation costs\nThe Company successfully completed the separation transaction on October 2, 2023.  We incurred pre-tax charges related to the separation of $2 million and $11 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 27, 2025, respectively. We incurred pre-tax charges of $10 million and $29 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 28, 2024, respectively.  \nNetwork optimization\nCosts related to reorganizations to increase the productivity and efficiency of the Company's supply chain. As a result, we incurred pre-tax charges, primarily related to severance and asset impairment, of $8 million and $22 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 27, 2025, respectively. We recorded pre-tax charges of $12 million and $121 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 28, 2024, respectively. \nProposed merger costs\nIn August 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement under which Mars has agreed to acquire Kellanova, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. In conjunction with the agreement, we incurred pre-tax charges, primarily related to legal and consulting costs, of $16 million and $28 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 27, 2025, respectively. We recorded pre-tax charges of $22 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 28, 2024. \nBusiness and portfolio realignment\nCosts related to reorganizations in support of our Deploy for Growth priorities and a reshaped portfolio; investments in enhancing capabilities prioritized by our Deploy for Growth strategy; and prospective divestitures and acquisitions. As a result, we recorded pre-tax charges, primarily related to reorganizations, of $2 million and $3 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 27, 2025, respectively. We recorded $2 million and $6 million for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 28, 2024.\n28\nTable of Contents\nDomestic tax benefit\nIn September 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell a foreign subsidiary in Egypt. In conjunction with the agreement, we recognized a tax benefit of $41 million for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, related to the excess of tax basis over book on our investment in the subsidiary. The sale of the subsidiary was completed in the second quarter of 2025.\nForeign currency translation\nWe evaluate the operating results of our business on a currency-neutral basis. We determine currency-neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.\n29\nTable of Contents\nFinancial results\nFor the quarter ended September 27, 2025, our reported net sales increased slightly year on year, on growth momentum in noodles in Africa and positive foreign currency translation, partially offset by category softness elsewhere and a related shift in business mix. Organic net sales decreased slightly from the prior year excluding foreign currency.\nThird quarter reported operating profit decreased 1% year on year, \ndue to a significantly lower mark-to-market benefit than the prior year, the gross profit impacts of lower net sales outside Africa, and higher costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. \nCurrency-neutral adjusted operating profit increased 6.6%, after excludin\ng the impact of mark-to-market, costs of the proposed merger, network optimization costs, separation costs, business and portfolio realignment, and foreign currency.     \nReported diluted EPS of $0.88 for the quarter decreased 16% compared to the prior year quarter of $1.05, \n reflecting the lower mark-to-market benefit, a higher effective tax rate, including the lapping of a prior-year tax benefit, the gross profit impacts of lower net sales outside Africa, and higher costs.\n Currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS of $0.93 for the quarter increased 2.2% from the prior year quarter after excluding mark-to-market, costs of the proposed merger, network optimization costs, separation costs\n, business and portfolio realignment, domestic tax benefit, and foreign currency.      \nReconciliation of certain non-GAAP Financial Measures\n \nQuarter ended\nYear-to-date period ended\nConsolidated results\n(dollars in millions, except per share data)\nSeptember 27,\n2025\nSeptember 28,\n2024\nSeptember 27,\n2025\nSeptember 28,\n2024\nReported net income\n$\n309\n \n$\n367 \n$\n912\n \n$\n978 \nMark-to-market (pre-tax)\n7\n \n60 \n(10)\n82 \nSeparation costs (pre-tax)\n(2)\n(10)\n(11)\n(29)\nNetwork optimization (pre-tax)\n(8)\n(12)\n(22)\n(121)\nProposed merger costs (pre-tax)\n(16)\n(22)\n(28)\n(22)\nBusiness and portfolio realignment (pre-tax)\n(2)\n(2)\n(3)\n(6)\nIncome tax impact applicable to adjustments, net*\n1\n \n(5)\n10\n \n20 \nDomestic tax benefit\n—\n \n41 \n—\n \n41 \nAdjusted net income\n$\n329\n \n$\n317 \n$\n975\n \n$\n1,013 \nForeign currency impact\n2\n \n— \n(2)\n— \nCurrency-neutral adjusted net income\n$\n327\n \n$\n317 \n$\n977\n \n$\n1,013 \nReported diluted EPS\n$\n0.88\n \n$\n1.05 \n$\n2.61\n \n$\n2.83 \nMark-to-market (pre-tax)\n0.02\n \n0.17 \n(0.03)\n0.24 \nSeparation costs (pre-tax)\n—\n \n(0.03)\n(0.03)\n(0.08)\nNetwork optimization (pre-tax)\n(0.02)\n(0.03)\n(0.06)\n(0.35)\nProposed merger costs (pre-tax)\n(0.04)\n(0.06)\n(0.08)\n(0.06)\nBusiness and portfolio realignment (pre-tax)\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.03)\nIncome tax impact applicable to adjustments, net*\n—\n \n(0.02)\n0.03\n \n0.06 \nDomestic tax benefit\n—\n \n0.12 \n—\n \n0.12 \nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$\n0.94\n \n$\n0.91 \n$\n2.79\n \n$\n2.93 \nForeign currency impact\n0.01\n \n— \n—\n \n— \nCurrency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS\n$\n0.93\n \n$\n0.91 \n$\n2.79\n \n$\n2.93 \nCurrency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth\n2.2\n \n%\n(4.8)\n%\nNote: Tables may not foot due to rounding.\nFor more information on the reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\n*Represents the estimated income tax effect on the reconciling items, using weighted-average statutory tax rates, depending upon the applicable jurisdiction.\n30\nTable of Contents\nNet sales and operating profit\nThe following tables provide an analysis of net sales and operating profit performance for the third quarter of 2025 versus 2024:\n \nQuarter ended September 27, 2025\n(millions)\nNorth\nAmerica\nEurope\nLatin\nAmerica\nAMEA\nCorporate\nKellanova\nConsolidated\nReported net sales\n$\n1,627\n \n$\n653\n \n$\n308\n \n$\n672\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,260\n \nForeign currency impact\n(1)\n27\n \n5\n \n13\n \n—\n \n43\n \nOrganic net sales\n$\n1,628\n \n$\n627\n \n$\n303\n \n$\n658\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,217\n \nQuarter ended September 28, 2024\n(millions)\nReported net sales\n$\n1,673 \n$\n660 \n$\n311 \n$\n590 \n$\n(1)\n$\n3,233 \nDivestiture\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nOrganic net sales\n$\n1,673 \n$\n660 \n$\n311 \n$\n590 \n$\n(1)\n$\n3,233 \n% change -

Initiatives undertaken are generally expected to recover cash implementation costs within a 1 to 5-year period subsequent to completion. Completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs) is when the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company announced a reconfiguration of the North America frozen supply chain network, designed to drive increased productivity. The project is now complete as of the quarter ended September 27, 2025. The overall project resulted in cumulative pretax charges of approximately $\n65\n million, which include employee-related costs of $\n7\n million, other cash costs of $\n15\n million, and non-cash costs, primarily consisting of asset impairment, accelerated depreciation, and asset disposals of $\n43\n million. Charges incurred related to this restructuring program were immaterial during the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 27, 2025, respectively. Charges incurred related to this restructuring program were $\n7\n million and $\n40\n million during the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 28, 2024, respectively. These charges primarily related to severance costs and asset impairment and were recorded in COGS.\n39\nTable of Contents\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company proposed a reconfiguration of the European cereal supply chain network and completed collective bargaining obligations and consultation with impacted employees during the quarter ended June 29, 2024. The project, designed to drive efficiencies, is expected to be substantially completed by late 2026, with resulting efficiencies expected to begin contributing to gross margin improvements in late 2026. The overall project is expected to result in cumulative pretax charges of approximately $\n120\n million, which include employee-related costs of $\n50\n million, other cash costs of $\n30\n million, and non-cash costs, primarily consisting of asset impairment, accelerated depreciation, and asset disposals of $\n40\n million. Charges incurred related to this restructuring program were $\n8\n million and $\n22\n million during the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 27, 2025, respectively. Charges incurred related to this restructuring program were $\n5\n million and $\n74\n million during the quarter and year-to-date periods ended September 28, 2024, respectively. These charges primarily related to severance costs and asset impairment and were recorded in COGS.\nAll other restructuring projects were immaterial during the periods presented.\nForeign currency translation\nThe reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Nigerian naira, Polish zloty, and Egyptian pound. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. This could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar is substantial.\nInterest expense\nFor the quarters ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, interest expense was $\n60\n million and $\n75\n million, respectively. For the year-to-date periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, interest expense was $186 million and $241 million, respectively. The decrease from the prior year is due primarily to lower average debt outstanding and lower interest rates on commercial paper and floating rate debt versus the prior year.\nIncome Taxes\nOur reported effective tax rate for the quarters ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 was 22% and 9%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year-to-date periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 was 21% and 18%, respectively. The increase in the consolidated effective tax rate from the prior year quarter and year-to-date period is due to the recognition of a $41 million domestic tax benefit during the third quarter of 2024 for the excess of tax basis over book on the Company's investment in a subsidiary. The adjusted effective income tax rate for the quarters ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 was 21% and 18%, respectively. The effective tax rate for both year-to-date periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 was 21%.  \nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon U.S. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory rates. Additionally, the rate could be impacted by tax legislation and if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “Act”) was enacted. The Act provides for several corporate tax changes including, but not limited to, restoring full expensing of domestic research and development costs, restoring immediate deductibility of certain capital expenditures, and changes in the computations of U.S. taxation on international earnings. We do not expect the new provisions of the Act to have a material impact to tax expense and cash flows for 2025.\n40\nTable of Contents\n \nQuarter ended\nYear-to-date period ended\nConsolidated results (dollars in millions)\nSeptember 27,\n2025\nSeptember 28,\n2024\nSeptember 27,\n2025\nSeptember 28,\n2024\nReported income taxes\n$\n89\n \n$\n34 \n$\n245\n \n$\n213 \nMark-to-market\n2\n \n15 \n(3)\n21 \nSeparation costs\n—\n \n(2)\n(1)\n(6)\nNetwork Optimization\n(2)\n(3)\n(5)\n(29)\nProposed merger costs\n—\n \n(5)\n(2)\n(5)\nBusiness and portfolio realignment\n—\n \n— \n1\n \n(1)\nDomestic tax benefit\n—\n \n(41)\n—\n \n(41)\nAdjusted income taxes\n$\n90\n \n$\n70 \n$\n255\n \n$\n274 \nReported effective income tax rate\n22.3\n \n%\n8.6 \n%\n21.1\n \n%\n17.8 \n%\nMark-to-market\n0.1\n \n%\n3.0 \n%\n—\n \n%\n0.6 \n%\nSeparation costs\n—\n \n%\n(0.1)\n%\n0.1\n \n%\n— \n%\nNetwork optimization\n—\n \n%\n(0.2)\n%\n—\n \n%\n(0.3)\n%\nProposed merger costs\n0.8\n \n%\n(0.3)\n%\n0.3\n \n%\n— \n%\nBusiness and portfolio realignment\n—\n \n%\n0.2 \n%\n0.1\n \n%\n— \n%\nDomestic tax benefit\n—\n \n%\n(12.1)\n%\n—\n \n%\n(3.7)\n%\nAdjusted effective income tax rate\n21.4\n \n%\n18.1 \n%\n20.6\n \n%\n21.2 \n%\nNote: Tables may not foot due to rounding.\nFor more information on the reconciling items in the table above, please refer to the Significant items impacting comparability section.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nWe anticipate current cash and marketable security balances, operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other financing sources including commercial paper, credit and bond markets, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. We currently have $2.5 billion of ongoing unused revolving credit agreements, including $1.5 billion effective through 2026 and $1.0 billion effective through December 2025, as well as continued access to the commercial paper markets. We are currently in compliance with all debt covenants and do not have material uncertainty about our ability to maintain compliance in future periods. \nOur principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. Our cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs. Our liquidity and operating cash flows may also be impacted by the timing and closing of the Merger, including as a result of the payment of any termination fee if the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company under certain circumstances permitted thereby. \nWe have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while optimizing the timing of payment of our trade payables. The impacts of the extended customer terms program and the monetization programs on core working capital are largely offsetting\n.\n \nWe periodically monitor our supplier payment terms to assess whether our terms are competitive and in line with local market terms. To the extent that such assessment indicates that our supplier payment terms are not aligned with local market terms, we may seek to adjust our terms, including extending or shortening our payment due dates as appropriate. Supplier payment term modifications did not have a material impact on our cash flows during 2024, and are not expected to have a material impact in \n2025\n.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments. These factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, fund acquisition opportunities, and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts. We had negative working capital of $1.6 billion and $0.9 billion as of September 27, 2025 and December 28, 2024, respectively. \n41\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reflects net debt amounts:\n(millions)\nSeptember 27, 2025\nDecember 28, 2024\nNotes payable\n$\n526\n \n$\n113 \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n759\n \n632 \nLong-term debt\n4,341\n \n4,998 \nTotal debt liabilities\n$\n5,626\n \n$\n5,743 \nLess:\nCash and cash equivalents\n240\n \n694 \nNet debt\n$\n5,386\n \n$\n5,049 \nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows:\n \nYear-to-date period ended\n(millions)\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n788\n \n$\n1,293 \nInvesting activities\n(478)\n(589)\nFinancing activities\n(736)\n(417)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n(28)\n8 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(454)\n$\n295 \nOperating activities\nThe principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture, distribute, and market our products.\nNet cash provided by our operating activities for the year-to-date period ended September 27, 2025, totaled $788 million compared to $1,293 million in the prior year period. The decrease is due primarily current year pension contributions totaling $157 million as well as lapping the distribution from the Company's postretirement benefit plan of $175 million during the first quarter of 2024.  \nWe measure free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. Our free cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, as follows:\n \nYear-to-date period ended\n(millions)\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n788\n \n$\n1,293 \nAdditions to properties\n(468)\n(440)\nFree cash flow\n$\n320\n \n$\n853 \nOur non-GAAP measure for free cash flow decreased to $320 million in the year-to-date period ended September 27, 2025, from $853 million in the prior year.  The decrease is due primarily to current year pension contributions totaling $157 million as well as lapping of the distribution from the Company's postretirement benefit plan of $175 million during the first quarter of 2024 and by higher capital expenditures. Additionally, cash flow from core working capital declined versus the prior year period.\nInvesting activities\nOur net cash used in investing activities totaled $478 million for the year-to-date period ended September 27, 2025 compared to $589 million in the comparable prior year period due primarily to the purchase of marketable securities in conjunction with the distribution from the postretirement healthcare plan in the prior year quarter partially offset by higher capital expenditures.\n42\nTable of Contents\nFinancing activities\nOur net cash used in financing activities for the year-to-date period ended September 27, 2025 totaled $736 million compared to cash used of $417 million during the comparable prior year period as certain long-term debt was repaid and replaced with the issuance of commercial paper. \nIn March 2025, the Company repaid its €600 million ten-year 1.250% Euro Notes due 2025 financed primarily with the issuance of U.S. commercial paper.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, Kellanova issued $300 million of thirty-year 5.75% Notes due 2054, resulting in net proceeds after discount and underwriting commissions of $296 million. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2024, Kellanova issued €300 million of ten-year 3.75% Notes due 2034, resulting in net proceeds after discount and underwriting commissions of €297 million. The proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the payment of offering related fees and expenses, repayment of a portion of the €600 million 1.00% Notes when they matured on May 17, 2024. \nIn December 2022, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of the Company's common stock through December 2025. This authorization is intended to allow the Company to repurchase shares for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs. As of September 27, 2025, $1.3 billion remains available under the authorization.\nThe Company did not repurchase shares during the year-to-date periods ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024. \nWe paid cash dividends of $598 million during the year-to-date period ended September 27, 2025, compared to $580 million during the comparable prior year period. In October 2025, the Board of Directors declared a dividend \nof $.58 per common share, payable on December 15, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 1, 2025. \nWe continue to maintain both \na Five-Year and a 364-Day Credit Agreement, which had no outstanding borrowings as of September 27, 2025, and contain customary covenants and warranties, including specified restrictions on indebtedness, liens and a specified interest expense coverage ratio. If an event of default occurs, then, to the extent permitted, the administrative agents may terminate the commitments under the credit facilities, accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreements, and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lender's letter of credit exposure plus interest.\nOur Notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions and also contain a change of control provision. There are no significant restrictions on the payment of dividends. We were in compliance with all covenants as of \nSeptember 27, 2025\n.\nThe Notes do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. A change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the U.S. short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future. However, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our 364-Day Credit Facility, which expires in December 2025, as well as our Five-Year Credit Agreement, which expires in December 2026. This source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it.\n43\nTable of Contents\nMonetization and Supplier Finance Programs\nWe have a program in which customers could extend their payment terms in exchange for the elimination of early payment discounts (Extended Terms Program). In order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the Extended Terms Program for discrete customers, we entered into agreements to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions (Monetization Programs). Transfers under the Monetization Programs are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Monetization Programs provide for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving basis until terminated by either party; however the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently approximately $975 million, but may be increased or decreased as customers move in or out of the Extended Terms Program and as additional financial institutions move in or out of the Monetization Programs. Accounts receivable sold of $762 million and $653 million remained outstanding under this arrangement as of \nSeptember 27, 2025\n and December 28, 2024, respectively. \nThe Monetization Programs are designed to directly offset the impact the Extended Terms Program would have on the days-sales-outstanding (DSO) metric that is critical to the effective management of the Company's accounts receivable balance and overall working capital. Current DSO levels within North America are consistent with DSO levels prior to the execution of the Extended Term Program and Monetization Programs. \nRefer to Note 3 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the sale of accounts receivable.\nWe periodically monitor our supplier payment terms to assess whether our terms are competitive and in line with local market terms. To the extent that such assessment indicates that our supplier payment terms are not aligned with local market terms, we may seek to adjust our terms, including extending or shortening our payment due dates as appropriate, however, we do not expect supplier payment term modifications to have a material impact on our cash flows during 2025. \nThe Company establishes competitive market-based terms with our suppliers, regardless of whether they participate in supplier finance programs, which generally range from 0 to 150 days dependent on their respective industry and geography. We have agreements with third parties (Supplier Finance Programs) to provide accounts payable tracking systems which facilitate participating suppliers’ ability to monitor and, if elected, sell our payment obligations to designated third-party financial institutions. Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to sell one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial institutions. We have no economic interest in the sale of these suppliers’ receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to sell amounts under the arrangements. However, our right to offset balances due from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by the agreements for those payment obligations that have been sold by suppliers.\nRefer to Note 1 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to accounts payable.\nIf financial institutions were to terminate their participation in the Monetization Programs and we are not able to modify related customer payment terms, working capital could be negatively impacted. Additionally, working capital could be negatively impacted if we shorten our supplier payment terms as a result of supplier negotiations. For suppliers participating in the Supplier Finance Programs, financial institutions may terminate their participation or we could experience a downgrade in our credit rating that could result in higher costs to suppliers. If working capital is negatively impacted as a result of these events and we were unable to secure alternative programs, we may have to utilize our various financing arrangements for short-term liquidity or increase our long-term borrowings.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCritical accounting estimates\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nWe review our operating segment and reporting unit structure annually or as significant changes in the organization occur and assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our reporting units with goodwill. Similarly, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these intangible assets. No interim triggering events requiring further impairment assessments of goodwill or indefinite-life intangibles have been noted during 2025. Annually during the fourth quarter, in conjunction with our annual budgeting process, we perform qualitative or quantitative testing, depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations. Refer to our Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2024 Form 10-K for further details on the methodologies used for evaluating goodwill and intangible assets.\nThe annual testing for goodwill and intangible asset impairment is currently underway and will be reported on in the 2025 Form 10-K. Fair value determinations used in the annual testing require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets requires making assumptions and estimates regarding the Company’s future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of the Company’s control, such as market comparables, rising discount rates, income tax rates, foreign currency exchange rate volatility, or inflation, change, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, then one or more of our reporting units or indefinite-lived assets could become impaired in the future. \nForward-looking statements\nThis Report contains “forward-looking statements” with projections and expectations concerning, among other things, the Company’s restructuring programs; the timing, completion and other effects of the Merger; the integration of acquired businesses; our strategy, financial principles, and plans; initiatives, improvements and growth; sales, margins, advertising, promotion, merchandising, brand building, operating profit, and earnings per share; innovation; investments; capital expenditures; asset write-offs and expenditures and costs related to productivity or efficiency initiatives; the impact of accounting changes and significant accounting estimates; our ability to meet interest and debt principal repayment obligations; minimum contractual obligations; future common stock repurchases or debt reduction; effective income tax rate; cash flow and core working capital improvements; interest expense; commodity and energy prices; ESG performance; and employee benefit plan costs and funding.
