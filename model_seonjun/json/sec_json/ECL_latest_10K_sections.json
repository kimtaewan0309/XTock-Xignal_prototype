Food & Beverage also designs, engineers and installs CIP (“clean-in-place”) process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer base. Water savings, energy savings, and operating efficiency are among our sources of value creation for our customers. Products for use in processing facilities are sold primarily by our corporate account and field sales employees, while products for use on farms are sold through dealers and independent, third-party distributors.\n​\nWe believe we are one of the leading global suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the dairy plant, dairy, swine and poultry farm, beverage/brewery, food, meat and poultry, and beverage/brewery processing industries.\n​\nPaper\n​\nPaper provides water and process applications for the pulp and paper industries, offering a comprehensive portfolio of programs that are used in all principal steps of the papermaking process and across all grades of paper, including graphic grades, board and packaging, and tissue and towel. While Paper provides its customers similar types of products and programs for water treatment and wastewater treatment as those offered by Water, Paper also offers two specialty programs that differentiate its offerings from Water—pulp applications and paper applications. Our pulp applications maximize process efficiency and increase pulp cleanliness and brightness in bleaching operations, as well as predict and monitor scaling potential utilizing on-line monitoring to design effective treatment programs and avoid costly failures. Our paper process applications focus on improving our customers’ operational efficiency, in part through water savings, energy savings and operating efficiency. Advanced digital sensing, monitoring and automation combine with innovative chemistries and detailed process knowledge to provide a broad range of customer solutions. Specialty products include flocculants, coagulants, dewatering aids and digester yield additives. Our offerings are sold primarily by our corporate account and field sales employees.\n​\nWe believe we are one of the leading global suppliers of water treatment products and process aids to the pulp and papermaking industry.\n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Institutional & Specialty\n​\nThis reportable segment consists of the Institutional and Specialty operating segments, which provide specialized cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, government, education and retail industries. The underlying operating segments exhibit similar manufacturing processes, distribution methods and economic characteristics. Descriptions of the two operating segments which comprise our Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment follow below.\n​\nInstitutional\n​\nInstitutional sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes, glassware, flatware, foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment (“warewashing”), plus specialized cleaners for various applications throughout food service operations, on-premise laundries (typically used by hotel and healthcare customers) and general housekeeping functions. We also sell food safety products and equipment, water filters, dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice, lodging, educational and healthcare industries. Institutional also provides pool and spa treatment programs for hospitality and other commercial customers, as well as a broad range of janitorial cleaning and floor care products and programs to customers in hospitality, healthcare and commercial facilities. Institutional develops various digital monitoring and chemical dispensing systems which are used by our customers to efficiently and safely dispense our cleaners and sanitizers, and through these products, systems and our on-site sales and service expertise, develop better results for our customers including water savings, energy savings and operating efficiency. In addition, Institutional markets a lease program comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives and sanitizers, including full machine maintenance. Through our EcoSure Brand Protection business, Institutional also provides customized on-site evaluations, training and quality assurance services to foodservice and hospitality operations.\n​\nInstitutional sells its products and programs primarily through its direct field sales and corporate account sales personnel. Corporate account sales personnel establish relationships and negotiate contracts with larger multi-unit or “chain” customers. We also utilize independent, third-party foodservice, broad-line and janitorial distributors to provide logistics to end customers that prefer to work through these distributors. Many of these distributors also participate in marketing our product and service offerings to the end customers. Through our field sales personnel, we generally provide the same customer support to end-use customers supplied by these distributors as we do to direct customers.\n​\nWe believe we are one of the leading global suppliers of warewashing and laundry products and programs to the food service, hospitality and lodging markets.\n​\nSpecialty\n​\nSpecialty supplies cleaning and sanitizing products and related items primarily to regional, national and international quick service restaurant (“QSR”) chains and food retailers (i.e., supermarkets and grocery stores). Its products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners, degreasers, sanitizers, polishes, hand care products and assorted cleaning tools and equipment which are primarily sold under the “Ecolab” and “Kay” brand names. QSR’s program also includes a lease program comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives and sanitizers, including full machine maintenance. Specialty’s cleaning and sanitation programs are customized to meet the needs of the market segments it serves and are designed to provide highly effective cleaning performance, promote food safety, reduce labor, water and energy costs and enhance user and guest safety. A number of dispensing options are available for products in the core product range. Specialty supports its product sales with training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers.\n​\nBoth Specialty’s QSR business and its food retail business utilize their corporate account sales force which manages relationships with customers at the corporate and regional office levels (and, in the QSR market segment, at the franchisee level) and their field sales force which provides program support at the individual restaurant or store level. QSR customers are primarily supplied through third party distributors while most food retail customers utilize their own distribution networks. While Specialty’s customer base has broadened significantly over the years, Specialty’s business remains largely dependent upon a limited number of major QSR chains and franchisees and large food retail customers.\n​\nFood Safety Solutions supplies a digital platform that combines software, hardware and multiple services to automate kitchen procedures for efficiency and compliance. It also offers a unique variety of products, tools and equipment for food preparation, food rotation labeling, temperature management, cleaning and employee safety across all food service customers. \n​\nWe believe we are one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the global QSR market and the global food retail market. \n​\n​\n​\n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Healthcare & Life Sciences\n​\nThis reportable segment consists of the Healthcare and Life Sciences operating segments, which provide specialized cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care and pharmaceutical industries. The underlying operating segments exhibit similar manufacturing processes, distribution methods and economic characteristics. Descriptions of the two operating segments which comprise our Global Healthcare & Life Sciences reportable segment follow below.\n​\nHealthcare\n​\nHealthcare provides infection prevention solutions to acute care hospitals, surgery centers and medical device Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”). Healthcare’s proprietary infection prevention solutions (hand hygiene, hard surface disinfection, digital monitoring systems and instrument cleaning) are sold primarily under the \"Ecolab\" and “Anios” brand names to various departments within the acute care environment (Infection Control, Environmental Services, Central Sterile and Operating Room). Healthcare sells its products and programs principally through its field sales personnel and corporate account personnel but also sells through healthcare distributors. \n​\nWe believe we are one of the leading suppliers of infection prevention solutions in the United States and Europe. \n​\nLife Sciences\n​\nLife Sciences provides end-to-end cleaning and contamination control solutions to pharmaceutical and personal care manufacturers. These products are primarily sold under the “Ecolab” brand name, and include detergents, cleaners, sanitizers, disinfectants, surface wipes, as well as cleaning systems, electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products. The Life Sciences portfolio includes premium fluid treatment and purification solutions with a broad range of unique products sold under the “Purolite” brand name, particularly focusing on biopharma purification solutions, active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API’s”) and high value industrial applications. The Life Sciences portfolio also includes decontamination systems and services utilizing hydrogen peroxide vapor, which are sold under the “Bioquell” brand name. The pharmaceutical clean room environment is the primary area that Ecolab and Bioquell products are utilized. Products and programs are sold primarily through our field sales and corporate account personnel, and to a lesser extent through distributors.\n \n​\nLife Sciences is comprised of customers and accounts related to manufacturing in the following industries: pharmaceutical, animal health and medicine, blood purification and dialysis, biologic products, cosmetics and medical devices. Our tailored, comprehensive solutions and technical know-how focus on ensuring product quality, safety and compliance standards are met while improving operational efficiency in customers’ cleaning, sanitation and disinfection processes. We believe we are one of the leading suppliers of process purification solutions in Europe and North America and of contamination control solutions in Europe, with a growing presence in North America and other regions. \n​\n​\nGlobal Pest Elimination\n​\nThis reportable segment consists of the Pest Elimination operating segment. \n​\nPest Elimination\n​\nPest Elimination provides services designed to detect, prevent and eliminate pests, such as rodents and insects, in full-service and quick-service restaurants, food and beverage processors, hotels, grocery operations and other commercial segments including education, life sciences and healthcare.\n​\nIn addition to the United States, which constitutes our largest operation, we operate in various countries in Asia Pacific, Greater China, Western Europe, Latin America, and Africa.\n​\nWe believe Pest Elimination is a leading service provider of effective, high-quality pest elimination programs that deliver high quality outcomes to commercial segments in the geographies it serves.\n​\n​\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAdditional Information\n​\nInternational Operations\n \n​\nWe directly operate in approximately 100 countries outside of the United States through wholly-owned subsidiaries or, in some cases, through a joint venture with a local partner. In certain countries, selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors, agents or licensees, although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues. In general, our businesses conducted outside the United States are similar to those conducted in the United States.\n​\nOur business operations outside the United States are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations, including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws, international business laws and regulations, tax laws, currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions. The profitability of our international operations is generally lower than the profitability of our businesses in the United States, due to (i) the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions with varying laws and regulations, (ii) higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions, (iii) the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size, and (iv) the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins. Proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations.\n​\nCompetition\n​\nIn general, the markets in which the businesses in our Global Industrial reportable segment compete are led by a few large companies, with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services. Our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value, technical expertise, innovation, digital technology, chemical formulations, global customer support, detection equipment, monitoring capabilities, and dosing and metering equipment. Through the combination of our digitally enabled end-to-end water management and hygiene solutions, data-driven insights and personalized service, our Global Industrial businesses deliver outcomes that help our customers optimize water and energy use, improve productivity, advance food safety, and achieve sustainability and net zero goals, while optimizing total cost of operations.\n​\nThe businesses in our Global Institutional & Specialty and Global Pest Elimination reportable segments have two significant classes of competitors. First, we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale. Second, we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies, product lines and/or end-use customer segments. We believe we compete principally by providing superior value, premium customer support, training, service, and innovative and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation and improve their operational efficiency.\n​\nWithin the Global Healthcare & Life Sciences reportable segment, the Healthcare business competes geographically with companies primarily focused on a smaller range of product categories, with few globally scaled competitors. The Life Sciences business competes in the European market versus several mid-size and regional competitors and competes against two large and other mid-size or regional competitors in North America. Outside of North America and Europe competitors are much more fragmented and do not offer the same level of service or coverage as Ecolab. Our businesses in this segment compete by enabling our customers success through improved hygiene, digitally enabled programs in operating room and patient room space as well as a tailored approach to delivering key inputs that directly impact our customers patients globally.\n​\nSales\n​\nOur products, systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by our Company-trained direct field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and most efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation, water treatment and process chemistry needs. Independent, third-party distributors and, to a lesser extent, sales agents, are utilized in several markets, as described in the segment descriptions found above.\n​\nCustomers and Classes of Products\n​\nWe believe our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer. Additionally, although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constituted 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues in 2024, 2023 or 2022, we do have customers and independent third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position. No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit.\n​\nWe sold one class of products within the Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment which comprised 10% or more of consolidated net sales in the last three years. Sales of warewashing products were approximately 12% of consolidated net sales in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n​\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital\n​\nAs of December 31, 2024, Ecolab employed approximately 48,000 employees. The largest component of our workforce is more than 25,000 sales and service employees. Our innovation efforts are supported by approximately 3,000 research, development, engineering and digital experts. Approximately 44% of the employees are employed in North America, 21% in Europe, 12% in Latin America, 8% in Asia Pacific, 8% in India, Middle East and Africa, and 7% in Greater China. \n​\nWe believe that doing the right thing, the right way, is good for business. We believe that driving performance and growing fast, we can deliver a net positive impact in our own operations and what we deliver for our customers. We believe that Ecolab’s century-long growth, innovation and high performance have benefited from a workplace where individuals from all backgrounds are encouraged to reach their full potential. We believe in providing training and career development opportunities to all employees and in compensating and rewarding our employees equitably.\n​\nOur commitment to the safety of our employees, contractors, and customers is evident in the way we operate, the products we develop, and the customers we serve. In addition, we are committed to promoting the health and well-being of our employees, our customers, and their customers by contributing to programs and initiatives that enhance the quality of life in the communities where they work and live. In support of these overall objectives, key areas of focus include: \n​\nWorkplace Culture: \nWith approximately 48,000 associates in more than 170 countries, Ecolab representatives engage daily with a diverse range of colleagues, customers, and communities. We are committed to developing a culture where all voices are heard and equitable employment opportunities are available to everyone. To sustain our success, we work to embed our values of inclusivity and engagement throughout our people processes, including recruitment, retention and development. \n​\nWe also have a vibrant and growing community of 11 Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) that are open to all Ecolab associates, to help employees connect with colleagues, take part in career and leadership development experiences, and provide important insights that help advance our workplace culture. All employees are welcome and encouraged to join, participate, or become leaders and allies within any of our ERGs.\n​\nEmployee Training and Development: \nEcolab’s growth has been characterized by a century of supporting customers by combining science, technology and innovation with the expertise of our associates. Beyond rigorous technical, functional, and business-specific training courses, our Global Corporate Flagship Development Programs for supervisors, managers and leaders are designed to deepen leadership capability and prepare potential successors for key leadership roles. \n​\nCompensation and Benefits:\n Ecolab has a market-competitive and performance-based pay philosophy, and we believe in compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are committed to rewarding and recognizing employees for their contributions to the success of the organization. This includes our global merit increase program and our short- and long-term variable pay programs, which include goals and targets that are tied to the success of the business. We test our pay and wage data against compensation surveys to align our pay with the competitive external market. In the U.S., we conduct pay equity studies, and we are in the process of expanding pay equity studies outside the U.S.\n​\nEcolab also provides market-competitive benefits based on country-specific needs and government requirements. While our benefits packages vary by market, they are designed to attract top talent and build long-term connections with our associates. Aligned to the applicable market and local regulations, elements of our benefits programs may include medical and dental insurance, retirement savings, employee stock purchase plan, paid time off, parental leave and adoption assistance, life and disability insurance, and employee assistance plans.\n​\nSafety, Health, and Wellness: \nAt Ecolab, the safety of our employees and contractors is a top priority and is embedded into our company values. Our safety goals are simple: zero accidents, zero injuries, and zero violations. We communicate that this is a collective goal all employees commit to, own, and deliver on every day. Our leadership teams and a network of Safety, Health, and Environment professionals around the world support employees with robust safety programs, processes, and platforms. Understanding underlying and potential risks is a critical component to improving safety outcomes. Our Global Safety Dashboard tracks our performance on a range of leading and lagging safety indicators and helps us measure the effectiveness of our safety programs.\n​\n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, a Be Well Program is available to U.S. employees and their families to empower, educate and support their personal journey to overall well-being by making positive lifestyle choices while creating a culture of wellness throughout Ecolab. Over the last few years, we’ve expanded our offerings to include comprehensive child and elder caregiver resources to help employees balance the demands of work and personal responsibilities. Wellness initiatives are also underway outside the U.S. aligned to country-specific needs and market practices.\n​\nPatents and Trademarks\n​\nWe own and license a number of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property. While we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action, when appropriate, to prevent infringement, except for the items listed below, we do not believe our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark.\n​\n●\nTrademarks related to Ecolab, Nalco and 3D TRASAR, which collectively are material to all of our reportable segments. The Ecolab, Nalco and 3D TRASAR trademarks are registered or applied for in all of our key markets and we anticipate maintaining them indefinitely.\n​\nSeasonality\n​\nWe experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to seasonal sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments. Part II, Item 8, Note 20, entitled “Quarterly Financial Data” of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference. \n​\nInvestments in Equipment\n​\nWe have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in process control and monitoring equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our products as well as to monitor water systems. The investment in such equipment is discussed under the heading \"Investing Activities\" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.\n​\nManufacturing and Distribution\n​\nWe manufacture most of our products and related equipment in Company-operated manufacturing facilities. Some products are also produced for us by third-party contract manufacturers. Other products and equipment are purchased from third-party suppliers. Additional information on product/equipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located under Part I, Item 2. “Properties,” of this Form 10-K.\n​\nDeliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and third-party logistics service providers. We use common carriers, our own delivery vehicles, and distributors for transport. Additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located under Part I, Item 2. “Properties,” of this Form 10-K.\n​\nRaw Materials\n​\nRaw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals, including alkalis, acids, biocides, phosphonates, phosphorous materials, silicates and salts; and organic chemicals, including acids, alcohols, amines, fatty acids, surfactants, solvents, monomers and polymers. Pesticides used by Pest Elimination are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors. We also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems. We purchase more than 10,000 raw materials, with the largest single raw material representing approximately four percent of raw material purchases. Our raw materials, with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture, are generally purchased on an annual contract basis and are ordinarily available in adequate quantities from a diverse group of suppliers globally. When practical, global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs.\n​\nResearch and Development\n​\nOur research and development program consists principally of developing and validating the performance of new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of those already existing, improving service program content, evaluating the environmental compatibility of products and technical support. Key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry, microbiology, data science and predictive analytics, process and packaging engineering, digital and remote monitoring engineering and product dispensing technology. Substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research, development and engineering personnel. \n​\nWe believe continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position within the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers. \n​\n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\nJoint Ventures\n​\nOver time, we have entered into partnerships or joint ventures in order to meet local ownership requirements, to achieve quicker operational scale, to expand our ability to provide our customers a more fully integrated offering or to provide other benefits to our business or customers. During 2024, the impact on our consolidated net income of our joint ventures, in the aggregate, was approximately three percent. We will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic, technological and product reach.\n​\nEnvironmental and Regulatory Considerations\n​\nOur businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health. While we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects, some risks are inherent in our businesses. Among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean-up, fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations. Similarly, the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations. Changes in such laws and regulations, including among others, air, water, chemical and product regulations, could impact the sales of some of our products or services. In addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products, a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products.\n​\nAdditionally, although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances, there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below.\n​\nIngredient Legislation\n: Various laws and regulations have been enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous, volatile organic compounds, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment. Under California Proposition 65, for example, label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by California. Chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by several states. \n​\nEnvironmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in a number of states to date, and in recent years have been considered by several other state legislatures. Cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress in each of the past few years but has not passed, and several states are considering further regulations in this area. In 2017, California passed the Cleaning Product Right to Know Act of 2017, that required ingredient transparency on-line and on-label by 2020 and 2021, respectively. The U.S. Government is monitoring “green chemistry” initiatives through a variety of initiatives, including its “Design for the Environment” (“DfE”)/“Safer Choice” program. DfE/Safer Choice has three broad areas of work (recognition of safer products on a DfE/Safer Choice label, development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals), and we are involved in these to varying degrees. Our Global Institutional and Global Industrial cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stay-in-market expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern. To date, we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications. Such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows to date.\n​\nTSCA\n: The nation’s primary chemicals management law, the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), was updated with the passage of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (“LCSA”) in 2016. The LCSA modernizes the original 1976 legislation, aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in commerce and improve the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) capability and authority to regulate existing and new chemical substances. For Ecolab, the TSCA changes mainly impact testing and submission costs for new and existing chemical substances in the United States. As a result of reform and multiple administration changes, EPA reviews are resulting in the majority of new substances being regulated in some manner by the agency. As the agency continues to review existing chemistries, the likelihood that substances manufactured, imported, or processed by Ecolab may be subject to additional testing costs and/or risk management decisions is increasing. Future EPA risk evaluation decisions may result in the reduction or elimination of future uses for some products. Compliance with new requirements under TSCA are similar to the costs associated with REACH in the European Union, which is discussed below.\n​\nREACH\n: The European Union has enacted a regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”), which aims to manage chemical safety risks. REACH established a European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”) in Helsinki, Finland, which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in Europe. We met all REACH registration requirements. To help manage this program, we have been simplifying our product lines and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements. In addition, Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, India, Chile and Colombia and other countries have implemented or are implementing similar requirements. In addition, the European Green Deal will include the revision of chemical management regulation to achieve a circular economy and toxic-free environment (Chemical Strategy for Sustainability) which may impact sales in Ecolab’s raw material portfolio. Potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position.\n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGHS\n: In 2003, the United Nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (“GHS”). GHS is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets (“SDSs”). As of 2024, most countries in which we operate have adopted or are expected to adopt GHS-related legislation. The primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising SDSs and product labels. We have met applicable deadlines and are working toward a phased-in approach to mitigate the costs of GHS implementation in remaining countries (e.g., Peru, Chile, India). We are also implementing updates, where applicable, of GHS revisions in countries where it is already present (e.g., US, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore). Potential costs to us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position.\n​\nPesticide and Biocide Legislation\n: Various international, federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. We manufacture and sell certain disinfecting, sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) on hard environmental surfaces, in process fluids and on certain food products. Such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the principal federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides. We maintain several hundred product registrations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay on-going registration fees. In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by FIFRA. However, California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and California imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state. While the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows to date, the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase. Total fees paid to the EPA and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position.\n​\nIn Europe, the Biocidal Products Regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products. We are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met all relevant deadlines of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances and biocide products. Anticipated registration costs, which will be incurred through the multi-year phase-in period, will be significant; however, these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position. The same is true for emerging biocide regulations in Asia.\n​\nIn addition, Pest Elimination applies restricted-use pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties. That business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides. Such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations. We have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements. \n​\nFDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements\n: Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and foods. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food. The FDA codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality, safety and effectiveness. The FDA also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including proposing regulations for over-the-counter antiseptic drug products, which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the FDA.\n​\n​\n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMedical Device, Drug and Cosmetic Product Requirements\n: As a manufacturer, distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs, we also are subject to regulation by the FDA and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state, local and foreign governments in which we sell our products. These regulations govern the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products, including Advanced Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“API”), excipients and resins for biopharmaceutical processing. \n​\n●\nIn the \nUnited States\n, we are required to register with the FDA as a medical device, drug and cosmetic manufacturer, comply with post-market reporting (e.g., Adverse Event Reporting, MDR and Recall) requirements, and to comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Practice Guidelines (“GxPs”), which ensure that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards and must be approved by the competent authorities.\n​\n●\nCountries in the \nEuropean Union\n require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “CE mark,” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards, and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements (e.g., Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (“MDR”), and ISO 13485). We have CE mark approval to sell various medical devices. Implementation of the MDR has required additional investments, including system, product, process, technical file and product improvements. Additionally, pharmaceutical products in the EU must comply with regulations such as the GxP guidelines.\n​\n●\nIn \nAustralia\n, products must comply with the regulations set by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”). Medical devices must be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (“ARTG”) and meet the Essential Principles for safety and performance. Therapeutic goods, including drugs and cosmetics, must adhere to specific standards and regulatory frameworks for safety, quality, efficacy, labelling, and claims. \n​\n●\nNon-EU export markets\n are also subject to government regulation and country-specific rules and regulations.\n​\nEquipment:\n Ecolab’s products are dispensed by equipment that is subject to state and local regulatory requirements, as well as being subject to UL, NSF, and other approval requirements. For certain digitally connected product offerings, Federal Communication Commission (“FCC”) and corresponding international requirements are applicable. We have both dedicated manufacturing facilities and third-party production of our equipment. We are developing processes to monitor and manage changing regulatory regimes and assist with equipment systems compliance. To date, such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n​\nOther Environmental Legislation\n: Our manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the United States are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We are also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air, land and water. The products we produce and distribute into Europe are also subject to directives governing electrical waste (WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU) and restrictive substances (RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU). Similar legal requirements apply to Ecolab’s facilities globally. We make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles. To date, such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our capital expenditures for environmental, health and safety projects worldwide were approximately $56 million in 2024, $46 million in 2023 and $35 million in 2022. Approximately $60 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2025. \n​\nClimate Change\n: Various laws and regulations addressing climate change are being implemented or considered at international, national, regional, and state levels, particularly focusing on reducing greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Notable regulations include California's 2023 GHG emissions reporting regulations addressing emissions, climate-related risks, and reduction claims, and the European Commission’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which became effective January 2024 and is applicable to both EU and certain non-EU companies with a phased introduction. We are or may become subject to many of these laws. We continue to monitor and evaluate these regulations and incorporate reporting and disclosure obligations as appropriate. \n​\nEcolab recognizes that climate change presents both risks and opportunities. We assess climate-related risks within our Enterprise Risk Management process, aligned with the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations. Our TCFD disclosures are available in our annual CDP Climate report on our website. Since our first TCFD-aligned climate risk assessment in 2021, we have continued to review and adapt our strategies to manage climate risks and leverage opportunities for customer impact. We also evaluate potential water-related risks in our operations, disclosing the results in our Growth and Impact Report. Future analyses will explore nature-related risks linked to climate and water, aligned with the Task Force on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (“TNFD”) recommendations. \n​\nAs a corporate policy, we support a balanced approach to reducing GHG emissions while sustaining economic growth. We have established climate related goals to further our commitment. In 2019, we announced goals to reduce operational GHG emissions by half by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050, in alignment with the UN Global Compact’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C. In 2020, we further committed to move to 100% renewable energy by 2030 and set a science-based target (“SBT”) for Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions. In 2024, our net zero target for Science Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”) validation was \n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\napproved, including a near term Scope 3 target. Our near-term SBT aims to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% from 2018 levels, and Scope 3 emissions by 25% from 2022 levels, by 2030.\n​\nIn 2023, we invested $63 million and $5.7 million in capital and operating environmental program expenses, respectively. The investments resulted in a reduction of total energy consumption by almost 5.7 billion BTUs; reduction of emissions by 700 metric tons CO2e; and over 153 million gallons (~580,000 cubic meters) of water savings from reduction and recycling projects. These reductions are calculated using direct measurements (such as meter readings and utility reports for water) and best-practice methodologies, with 2018 as the baseline year.\n​\nBeyond our operations, we help customers in over 170 countries reduce their energy and GHG emissions through high-efficiency solutions in cleaning, sanitation, water, paper, and energy services. Our 2030 goals include: customer GHG emissions reduction of 6.0 million metric tons; water stewardship to restore over 50% of our water withdrawal and achieve Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard certification in high-risk watersheds; and water conservation to reduce net water withdrawals by 40% per unit of production and help customers conserve over 300 billion gallons of water annually.\n​\nThe science of sustainability is evolving. For factors that may affect our sustainability initiatives, goals, and targets, see Item 1A of this Form 10-K, entitled “Risk Factors.”\n​\nEnvironmental Remediation and Proceedings\n: Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties (“PRP”), we are currently involved with waste disposal site clean-up activities imposed by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) or state equivalents at 16 sites in the United States. Additionally, we have similar liability at six sites outside the United States. In general, under CERCLA, we and each other PRP that actually contributed hazardous substances to a Superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site. Customarily, the PRPs will work with the EPA to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. \n​\nBased on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings, our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph, and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other PRPs which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares, we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites. In establishing accruals, potential insurance reimbursements are not included. The accrual is not discounted. It is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes.\n​\nWe have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances, including multi-party lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services. While we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information, there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n​\nWe have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries, but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future, and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures. In each of these chemical exposure cases, our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf (with or without reservation) and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible; however, we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance.\n​\nOur worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately $0.7 million in 2024, $0.3 million in 2023 and $1.4 million in 2022. Our worldwide accruals at December 31, 2024 for probable future remediation expenditures, excluding potential insurance reimbursements, totaled approximately $19.6 million. We review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate. While the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n​\n​\nAvailable Information.\n​\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n​\nThe following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.\n​\nThe discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this MD&A, and “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K. We also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled “Results of Operations” of this MD&A for reconciliation information of Non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP.\n​\nComparability of Results\n​\nImpact of Acquisitions and Divestitures\n​\nOur non-GAAP financial measures for organic sales, organic operating income and organic operating income margin are at fixed currency and exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition and the results of divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture. As part of the separation of ChampionX in 2020, we entered into an agreement with ChampionX to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a transitionary period. Transitionary period sales of product to ChampionX under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. The remaining sales to ChampionX are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Global Industrial segment along with the related cost of sales. Further, due to the sale of the global surgical solutions business on August 1, 2024, we have excluded the results of the business for August through December 2023 from these organic measures for the year ended December 31, 2023 to remain comparable to the corresponding period in 2024. These transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\n​\nComparability of Reportable Segments\n​\nEffective January 1, 2024, the former Textile Care and Colloidal Technologies Group (“CTG”) operating segments are now part of the Water operating segment which continues to remain in the Global Industrial reportable segment. Additionally, the Pest Elimination operating segment, formerly aggregated with the Textile Care and CTG operating segments within Other, is now reported as the stand-alone Global Pest Elimination reportable segment. We made other immaterial changes, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments. After these changes, we have eight operating segments.\n​\nFixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates\n​\nManagement evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Public currency rate data provided within the “Segment Performance” section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.\n​\n​\n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n​\nIn 2024, we delivered record sales, operating income margin, free cash flow, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our team generated high single digit sales growth in Institutional & Specialty and Pest Elimination while Industrial and Healthcare and Life Sciences generated good sales growth. Operating income grew by strong double digits, as strong value pricing, lower delivered product costs, and higher volumes overcame investments in the business.\n​\nSales\n​\nReported sales increased 3% to $15.7 billion in 2024 from $15.3 billion in 2023. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 3% compared to the prior year. Organic sales increased 4% compared to the prior year.\n​\nGross Margin\n​\nOur reported gross margin was 43.5% of sales for 2024, compared to our 2023 reported gross margin of 40.2%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales, our adjusted gross margin was 43.5% in 2024 and 40.4% in 2023. Our gross profit increase reflected strong value pricing and lower delivered product costs. \n​\nOperating Income \n​\nReported operating income increased 41% to $2.8 billion in 2024, compared to $2.0 billion in 2023. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges increased 23% in 2024 as strong value pricing, lower delivered product costs, and higher volumes were partially offset by investments in the business. Organic operating income increased 26% in 2024.\n \n​\nEarnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (“EPS”)\n \n​\nReported diluted EPS increased 54% to $7.37 in 2024 compared to $4.79 in 2023. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2024 were driven primarily by the gain on sale of the global surgical solutions business and restructuring expense and 2023 were driven primarily by restructuring expense. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items increased 28% to $6.65 in 2024 compared to $5.21 in 2023 which reflected solid organic sales growth, lower delivered product costs and continued investments in the business.\n​\nBalance Sheet\n​\nWe remain committed to maintaining “A” range ratings metrics over the long-term, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/A3/A- by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Services and Fitch, respectively. Our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.\n​\nCash Flow\n​\nCash flow from operating activities was $2.8 billion in 2024 compared to $2.4 billion in 2023. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. \n​\nDividends \n​\nDividends declared per common share in 2024 was $2.36 per share. In December 2024 we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 14% to $0.65 per share, representing our 33\nrd\n consecutive annual dividend rate increase. We have paid cash dividends on our common shares for 88 consecutive years. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our long-term growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.\n​\n​\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n​\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (“Notes”).\n​\nPreparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.\n​\nBesides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following:\n​\nRevenue Recognition\n​\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. Revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. Revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. Service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. Revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under Topic 842 Leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.\n​\nOur revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions. We record an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our estimates of expected future credit losses. \n​\nThe revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. We apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. Application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. We determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. In addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. For additional information on revenue recognition, refer to Note 17.\n​\nLitigation and Environmental Liabilities\n​\nOur business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.\n​\nWe record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, refer to Note 15.\n​\n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\nActuarially Determined Liabilities\n​\nPension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans\n​\nThe measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries in their valuations and calculations. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future pension contributions, benefit payments and expense or income recognized.\n​\nThe significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rates, expected returns on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality tables.\n​\n●\nThe discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bonds that have an average rating of AA when averaging available Moody’s Investor Services, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch ratings. The discount rates are calculated by matching each plans’ projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2024 and 2023, we measured service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. In determining our U.S. pension obligations and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2024, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 5.58% from 4.95% at year-end 2023.\n​\n●\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected returns on U.S. plan assets used in determining the U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 8.00% for 2024, 7.75% for 2023 and 7.00% for 2022.\n​\n●\nProjected salary is based on our long-term actual experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the U.S. pension expenses was 3.60% for 2024 and 4.03% for 2023 and 2022. \n​\n●\nFor postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December 31, 2024, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 8.59% for pre-65 costs. Post-65 costs are no longer used. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 4.5% in 2035 and remain at those levels thereafter.\n​\n●\nWe use mortality tables appropriate in the circumstances, which generally are the recently available mortality tables as of the respective U.S. and international measurement dates. Our year-end U.S. valuations reflect mortality tables that estimate the impacts of COVID in an endemic state. This represents a change from prior year when the impact of COVID on future mortality could not be reasonably estimated.\n​\nThe effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized gains or losses and amortized into earnings in the future. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations and income or expense. The unrecognized net losses on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans increased to $526 million as of December 31, 2024, from $495 million as of December 31, 2023 (both before tax), primarily due to lower actual return on assets partially offset by current year net actuarial gains.\n​\nThe effect of a decrease in the discount rate or in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2024, on the December 31, 2024 defined benefit obligation and 2025 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels. Expense amounts reflect the accounting for gains or losses as a component of other comprehensive income or expense and recognition of the impacts into earnings over time:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nEffect on U.S. Pension Plans\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIncrease in\n​\nHigher\n​\n​\nAssumption\n​\nRecorded\n​\n2025\n(millions)\n​\nChange\n​\nObligation\n​\nExpense\nDiscount rate\n    \n-.25 pts\n​\n​\n $33.5\n​\n​\n​\n $2.5\n​\nExpected return on assets\n \n-.25 pts\n​\n​\nN/A\n​\n​\n​\n 4.6\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nEffect on U.S. Postretirement\n​\n​\nHealth Care Benefits Plans\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIncrease in\n​\nHigher\n​\n​\nAssumption\n​\nRecorded\n​\n2025\n(millions)\n​\nChange\n​\nObligation\n​\nExpense\nDiscount rate\n    \n-.25 pts\n    \n​\n $2.0\n​\n    \n​\n $-\n​\nExpected return on assets\n \n-.25 pts\n​\n \nN/A\n​\n​\n​\n -\n​\n​\n​\n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.\n​\nRefer to Note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.\n​\nSelf-Insurance\n​\nGlobally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis. \n​\nIncome Taxes\n​\nJudgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits.\n​\nEffective Income Tax Rate\n​\nOur effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of unrecognized tax benefits. We recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in light of changing facts and circumstances. \n​\nTax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.\n​\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances\n​\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, we recognize tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, sources of future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. \n​\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\n​\nA number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed examinations of our U.S. federal income tax returns through 2018 and the years 2019 through 2020 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\n​\nThe tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have established a liability for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $34.1 million and $24.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For additional information on income taxes refer to Note 12.\n​\n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\nLong-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n​\nLong-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets\n​\nPurchased long-lived and amortizable intangible assets not acquired as part of a business combination are recorded as of their acquisition date at cost, whereas long-lived and amortizable assets acquired as part of a business combination are recorded as of their acquisition date at their fair values based on the fair value requirements defined in U.S. GAAP. This requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions relating to the present value of its future cash flows, such as growth rates, royalty rates or discount rates.\n​\nWe review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $6.5 billion and $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for impairment when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the manner in which asset or asset groups are being used or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset’s or assets group’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. \n​\nWe use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.\n​\nGlobally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer bases acquired from our Nalco, Laboratoires Anios (“Anios”), Copal Invest NV, including its primary operating entity CID Lines (collectively, “CID Lines”) and Purolite transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rates, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer bases. If our customer retention rates or other post-acquisition operational activities change materially, we would evaluate the financial impacts and significance of the events given rise to the change which could result in impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets, or absent an impairment, an acceleration of amortization expense.\n​\nIn addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying amount or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.\n​\nGoodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets\n​\nGoodwill arises from our acquisitions and represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration exchanged over the fair value of net assets acquired. We had total goodwill of $7.9 billion and $8.1 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are our eight operating segments. We assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the second quarter. If circumstances change or events occur that demonstrate it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we complete an interim goodwill impairment assessment of that reporting unit prior to the next annual assessment. If the results of an annual or interim goodwill impairment assessment demonstrate the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, we will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to that reporting unit. \n​\nFor our annual 2024 goodwill impairment assessment, we completed our impairment assessment for our eight reporting units using discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated assumptions regarding future growth rates, terminal values and discount rates. Our goodwill impairment assessments for 2024 indicated the estimated fair values of each of these eight reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts of the respective reporting units by a significant margin. No events were noted during the second half of 2024 that required completion of an interim goodwill impairment assessment in the second half of 2024 for any of our eight reporting units. There has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented. \n​\nThe Nalco trade name is our only indefinite life intangible asset, which is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the second quarter. For our annual 2024 indefinite life intangible asset impairment assessment, we completed our impairment assessment of the Nalco trade name using the relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections, royalty rates and discount rates. Our Nalco tradename impairment assessment for 2024 indicated the estimated fair value of the Nalco trade name exceeded its $1.2 billion carrying amount by a significant margin. No events were noted during the second half of 2024 that required completion of an interim impairment assessment of our Nalco trade name in the second half of 2024. There has been no impairment of the Nalco trade name intangible since it was acquired. \n​\n​\n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n​\nNet Sales\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n      \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPercent Change\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n(millions)\n​\n2024\n​\n2023\n​\n2022\n​\n2024\n​\n2023\nProduct and equipment sales\n​\n​\n $12,473.6\n​\n    \n​\n $12,316.8\n​\n    \n​\n $11,446.2\n​\n    \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nService and lease sales\n​\n​\n 3,267.8\n​\n​\n​\n 3,003.4\n​\n​\n​\n 2,741.6\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nReported GAAP net sales\n​\n​\n 15,741.4\n​\n​\n​\n 15,320.2\n​\n​\n​\n 14,187.8\n​\n​\n 3\n%  \n​\n 8\n%\nEffect of foreign currency translation\n​\n \n 131.6\n​\n \n \n 55.3\n​\n​\n \n 5.0\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNon-GAAP adjusted fixed currency sales\n​\n​\n 15,873.0\n​\n​\n​\n 15,375.5\n​\n​\n​\n 14,192.8\n​\n​\n 3\n%  \n​\n 8\n%\nEffect of acquisitions and divestitures\n​\n​\n (131.5)\n​\n​\n​\n (252.5)\n​\n​\n​\n*\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNon-GAAP organic sales\n​\n​\n $15,741.5\n​\n​\n​\n $15,123.0\n​\n​\n​\n*\n​\n​\n 4\n%  \n​\n*\n​\n* Not meaningful\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThe percentage components of the year-over-year sales change are shown below:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n(percent)\n​\n2024\n​\n2023\nVolume\n​\n  \n​\n 2\n%  \n​\n  \n*\n%  \nPrice changes\n​\n \n​\n2 \n​\n​\n \n*\n​\nOrganic sales change\n​\n \n​\n4 \n​\n​\n \n*\n​\nAcquisitions and divestitures\n​\n \n​\n (1)\n​\n​\n \n*\n​\nFixed currency sales change\n​\n \n​\n3 \n​\n​\n \n8 \n​\nForeign currency translation\n​\n \n​\n -\n​\n​\n \n -\n​\nReported GAAP net sales change\n​\n \n​\n3 \n%  \n​\n \n8 \n%  \n* Not meaningful\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAmounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.\n​\nCost of Sales (“COS”) and Gross Profit Margin (“Gross Margin”)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2024\n​\n2023\n​\n2022\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nGross\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nGross\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nGross\n(millions/percent)\n​\nCOS\n​\n​\nMargin\n​\n​\nCOS\n​\n​\nMargin\n​\n​\nCOS\n​\n​\nMargin\nProduct and equipment cost of sales\n​\n $6,990.0\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n $7,389.2\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n $7,212.8\n​\n​\n​\n​\nService and lease cost of sales\n​\n 1,909.7\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 1,765.7\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 1,618.2\n​\n​\n​\n​\nReported GAAP COS and gross margin\n​\n 8,899.7\n​\n​\n43.5 \n%  \n​\n​\n 9,154.9\n​\n​\n40.2 \n%\n​\n​\n 8,831.0\n​\n​\n37.8 \n%\nSpecial (gains) and charges\n​\n 5.3\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 22.5\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 69.9\n​\n \n​\n​\nNon-GAAP adjusted COS and gross margin\n​\n $8,894.4\n​\n​\n43.5 \n%  \n​\n​\n $9,132.4\n​\n​\n40.4 \n%\n​\n​\n $8,761.1\n​\n​\n38.2 \n%\n​\nOur COS values and corresponding gross margin are shown above.

As a program within this initiative, we also announced that we commenced a restructuring plan to leverage our digital technologies to realign the functional work done in many countries into global centers of excellence. We anticipate restructuring costs of $175 million ($136 million after tax) or $0.47 per diluted share and special charges of $50 million ($39 million after tax) or $0.14 per diluted share by the end of 2027. We anticipate that the restructuring costs will primarily be cash expenditures for severance costs relating to team reorganization.\n​\nIn anticipation of this One Ecolab initiative, a limited number of actions were taken in the first and second quarter of 2024. As a result, we reclassified $5.3 million ($4.0 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share from other restructuring to One Ecolab in the third quarter of 2024.\n​\nIn 2024 we recorded restructuring charges of $76.5 million ($59.0 million after tax), or $0.21 per diluted share primarily related to severance and professional services. In addition, we recorded non-restructuring special charges of $23.7 million ($17.9 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share in 2024 primarily related to professional services. We have recorded $81.8 million ($63.0 million after tax), or $0.22 per diluted share of cumulative restructuring charges and $23.7 million ($17.9 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share of cumulative special charges under the One Ecolab initiative. Net cash payments were $26.9 million during 2024.\n​\nThe net restructuring liability related to the One Ecolab initiative was $54.9 million as of December 31, 2024. The remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities.\n​\nOne Ecolab has delivered $12 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annualized cost savings of $140 million in continuing operations by 2027.\n​\nOther restructuring \n​\nOther restructuring activities are primarily related to the Combined Program which is described below. These activities have been included as a component of cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\nFurther details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3.\n​\nCombined Program\n​\nIn November 2022, we approved a Europe cost savings program. In February 2023, we expanded our previously announced Europe cost savings program to focus on our Institutional and Healthcare businesses in other regions. In connection with the expanded program (the “Combined Program”), we expected to incur total pre-tax charges of $195 million ($150 million after tax) or $0.52 per diluted share. These restructuring charges were completed at the end of 2024. Program actions included headcount reductions from terminations, not filling \n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncertain open positions, and facility closures. The Combined Program charges were primarily cash expenditures related to severance and asset disposals.\n​\nIn anticipation of this Combined Program, a limited number of actions were taken in the fourth quarter of 2022. As a result, we reclassified $19.3 million ($14.5 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share from other restructuring to the Combined Program in the first quarter of 2023.\n​\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022 we recorded restructuring charges of $25.2 million ($18.6 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share, $77.7 million ($66.4 million after tax) or $0.23 per diluted share and $67.2 million ($56.0 million after tax) or $0.20 per diluted share, respectively, primarily related to severance and professional services. Restructuring activities were completed at the end of 2024, with total costs $184.1 million ($151.5 million after tax), or $0.53 per diluted share. \n​\nWe reclassified $5.3 million ($4.0 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share from the combined restructuring program to other restructuring activities in the second quarter of 2024.\n​\nThe net liability related to the Combined Program was $12.8 million and $43.1 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash payments were $48.9 million and non-cash net charges were $1.3 million during 2024.The remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities.\n​\nThe Combined Program has delivered our targeted $175 million of annual cost savings.\n​\nOther Restructuring Activities\n​\nDuring 2024, we recorded restructuring charges of $10.6 million ($8.0 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share related to an immaterial restructuring plan approved in the second quarter. This plan became part of the One Ecolab initiative in the third quarter.\n​\nDuring 2023 and 2022, we recorded restructuring charges of $8.0 million ($6.0 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share and $40.0 million ($31.1 million after tax), or $0.11 per diluted share, respectively, related to immaterial or subsequently concluded restructuring programs. The charges were primarily related to severance and asset write-offs.\n​\nThe restructuring liability balance for all other restructuring plans excluding the One Ecolab and Combined Program, were $6.5 million and $8.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. Cash payments during 2024 related to all other restructuring plans excluding the One Ecolab and Combined Programs were $2.2 million.\n​\nSale of global surgical solutions business\n \nOn April 27, 2024, we reached a definitive agreement to sell our global surgical solutions business, which closed on August 1, 2024. During 2024 we recorded a gain on sale of $355.9 million ($257.7 million after tax) or ($0.90) per diluted share, as described in Note 4. Excluding the gain on sale, we recorded charges of $15.6 million ($12.0 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share in 2024, which are primarily related to professional fees to support the sale. During 2023 we recorded charges of $10.3 million ($7.7 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share, primarily related to professional fees to support the sale.\n​\nAcquisition and integration related costs\n​\nAcquisition and integration related costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2024 include $12.6 million ($9.6 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share, primarily related to the Purolite transaction.\n​\nAcquisition and integration related costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2023 include $16.1 million ($12.0 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share. Charges are integration related costs primarily related to the Purolite transaction.\n​\nAcquisition and integration related costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2022 include $14.5 million ($11.4 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share. Charges are related primarily to the Purolite transaction and consist of integration related costs, advisory and legal fees. Acquisition and integration related costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2022 include $25.0 million ($19.6 million after tax) or $0.07 per diluted share. Charges are related primarily to the recognition of fair value step-up in the Purolite inventory and other integration costs.\n​\nOther operating activities \n​\nDuring 2022, we recorded other operating activities to cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income of $23.5 million ($19.6 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share relating primarily to COVID-19 activities.\n​\nDuring 2024, we recorded other operating activities to special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income of $18.7 million ($13.9 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, relating primarily to a liability relating to a prior divestiture, COVID-19 activities, and certain legal charges. During 2023 and 2022, we recorded other operating activities to special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statements of Income of $21.8 million ($16.7 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, and $40.2 million ($31.4 million after tax), or $0.11 per diluted share, respectively, relating primarily to certain legal charges.\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOther (income) expense\n​\nDuring 2022, we incurred settlement expense recorded in other (income) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income of $50.6 million ($38.2 million after tax) or $0.13 per diluted share, respectively, related to U.S. pension plan lump-sum payments to retirees.\n​\nOperating Income and Operating Income Margin\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n      \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n      \n​\n​\nPercent Change\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n(millions)\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\n​\n​\n2024\n​\n2023\nReported GAAP operating income\n​\n​\n $2,802.4\n​\n​\n​\n $1,992.3\n​\n​\n​\n $1,562.5\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 41\n%  \n​\n​\n 28\n%  \nSpecial (gains) and charges\n \n​\n (183.6)\n​\n​\n​\n 133.9\n​\n​\n​\n 210.4\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n​\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating income\n \n​\n 2,618.8\n​\n​\n​\n 2,126.2\n​\n​\n​\n 1,772.9\n​\n​\n​\n \n 23\n​\n​\n \n 20\n​\nEffect of foreign currency translation\n \n​\n 32.9\n​\n​\n​\n 9.4\n​\n​\n​\n (5.3)\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n​\nNon-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income \n​\n​\n 2,651.7\n​\n​\n​\n 2,135.6\n​\n​\n​\n 1,767.6\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nEffect of acquisitions and divestitures\n​\n​\n (7.5)\n​\n​\n​\n (38.4)\n​\n​\n​\n*\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNon-GAAP organic operating income \n​\n​\n $2,644.2\n​\n​\n​\n $2,097.2\n​\n​\n​\n*\n​\n​\n​\n​\n 26\n%  \n​\n​\n*\n​\n* Not meaningful\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n(percent)\n    \n2024\n​\n2023\n​\n2022\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nReported GAAP operating income margin\n​\n​\n17.8\n%  \n​\n​\n 13.0\n%  \n​\n​\n 11.0\n%  \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating income margin\n​\n​\n16.6\n%  \n​\n​\n 13.9\n%  \n​\n​\n 12.5\n%  \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNon-GAAP adjusted fixed currency operating income margin \n​\n​\n16.7\n%  \n​\n​\n 13.9\n%  \n​\n​\n 12.5\n%  \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNon-GAAP organic operating income margin\n​\n​\n16.8\n%  \n​\n​\n 13.9\n%  \n​\n​\n*\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n* Not meaningful\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOur operating income and corresponding operating income margin are shown in the previous tables. Operating income margin is defined as operating income divided by sales.\n​\nOur reported operating income was $2,802.4 million, $1,992.3 million and $1,562.5 for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our 2024, 2023 and 2022 operating incomes were negatively (positively) impacted by special (gains) and charges of ($183.6 million), $133.9 million, and $210.4 million, respectively. \n​\nExcluding the impacts of special (gains) and charges, 2024 adjusted operating income increased 23% as strong value pricing, lower delivered product costs, and higher volumes were partially offset by investments in the business. Excluding the impacts of special (gains) and charges 2023 adjusted operating income increased 20% as strong pricing overcame investments in the business including incentive compensation, higher supply chain costs and unfavorable mix. \n​\nOther (Income) Expense\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n(millions)\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nReported GAAP other (income) expense\n​\n​\n ($51.3)\n​\n​\n​\n ($59.9)\n​\n​\n​\n ($24.5)\nSpecial (gains) and charges\n​\n​\n -\n​\n​\n \n -\n​\n​\n \n 50.6\nNon-GAAP adjusted other (income) expense\n​\n​\n ($51.3)\n​\n​\n​\n ($59.9)\n​\n​\n​\n ($75.1)\n​\nOur reported other income was $51.3 million, $59.9 million and $24.5 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Other (income) expense decreased when comparing 2024 against 2023 primarily due to higher pension costs. Other (income) expense increased when comparing 2023 against 2022 as higher pension costs were more than offset by the comparison to last year’s $50.6 million settlement expense related to U.S. pension plan lump-sum payments to retirees. Excluding the impact of settlements and curtailments recorded in special (gains) and charges during 2024, 2023 and 2022, our adjusted other income was $51.3 million, $59.9 million and $75.1 million, respectively.\n​\nInterest Expense, Net\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n(millions)\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nReported GAAP interest expense, net\n​\n​\n $282.5\n​\n​\n​\n $296.7\n​\n​\n​\n $243.6\n​\nOur reported net interest expense totaled $282.5 million, $296.7 million and $243.6 million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n​\nThe decrease in net interest expense when comparing 2024 against 2023 was driven primarily by lower interest expense from the repayment of our January 2024 note and the impact from higher interest income earned on cash balances driven by strong free cash flows and proceeds from the sale of the global surgical solutions business. The increase in interest expense when comparing 2023 against 2022 was driven primarily by the higher average interest rates on outstanding debt.\n​\n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\nProvision for Income Taxes\n​\nThe following table provides a summary of our tax rate:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n(percent)\n    \n2024\n​\n2023\n    \n2022\nReported GAAP tax rate\n​\n 17.1\n%\n​\n20.6 \n%  \n​\n17.5 \n%  \nTax rate impact of:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nSpecial (gains) and charges\n \n (1.1)\n​\n​\n(0.1)\n \n \n0.5 \n \nDiscrete tax items\n​\n 3.3\n​\n​\n(0.6)\n​\n​\n0.7 \n​\nNon-GAAP adjusted tax rate\n \n 19.3\n%\n​\n 19.9\n%  \n \n 18.7\n%  \n​\nOur reported tax rate was 17.1%, 20.6%, and 17.5%, for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special (gains) and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future. \n​\nWe recognized a net tax benefit related to discrete tax items of $78.6 million during 2024. Discrete items include tax benefits of $62.1 million associated with capital losses and $30.4 million of additional basis of foreign intangible assets. The remaining net discrete tax expense of $13.9 million was primarily related to the filing of federal, state and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments including the impact of changes in tax laws, audit settlements, share-based compensation excess tax benefit and other changes in estimates.\n​\nWe recognized a net tax expense related to discrete tax items of $11.2 million during 2023. The net discrete tax expense was primarily related to the filing of federal, state and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments including the impact of changes in tax laws, audit settlements, share-based compensation excess tax benefits and other changes in estimates.\n​\nWe recognized a net tax benefit related to discrete tax items of $11.8 million during 2022. This included a deferred tax benefit of $14.6 million associated with utilization of tax attributes as a result of legal entity rationalization and share-based compensation excess tax benefits of $6.0 million. The remaining discrete tax expense of $8.8 million was primarily related to the filing of federal, state and foreign tax returns and other income tax adjustments including the impact of changes in tax laws, audit settlements and other changes in estimates.\n​\nThe change in our adjusted tax rates from 2023 to 2024 was primarily driven by geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix. \n​\nNet Income Attributable to Ecolab\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPercent Change\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n(millions)\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\n    \n2024\n​\n2023\nReported GAAP net income attributable to Ecolab\n​\n​\n $2,112.4\n​\n​\n​\n $1,372.3\n​\n​\n $1,091.7\n​\n 54\n%\n​\n 26\n%\nAdjustments:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nSpecial (gains) and charges, after tax\n​\n \n (126.7)\n​\n​\n​\n 109.2\n​\n​\n 207.3\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDiscrete tax net (benefit) expense\n​\n​\n (78.6)\n​\n​\n​\n 11.2\n​\n​\n (11.8)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to Ecolab\n​\n​\n $1,907.1\n​\n​\n​\n $1,492.7\n​\n​\n $1,287.2\n​\n 28\n%\n​\n 16\n%\n​\nDiluted EPS\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPercent Change\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n(dollars)\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\n    \n2024\n​\n2023\nReported GAAP diluted EPS\n​\n​\n $7.37\n​\n​\n​\n $4.79\n​\n​\n $3.81\n​\n 54\n%\n​\n 26\n%\nAdjustments:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nSpecial (gains) and charges, after tax\n​\n \n (0.44)\n​\n​\n \n 0.38\n​\n \n 0.72\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nDiscrete tax net (benefit) expense\n​\n \n (0.28)\n​\n​\n \n 0.04\n​\n \n (0.04)\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNon-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS\n​\n​\n $6.65\n​\n​\n​\n $5.21\n​\n​\n $4.49\n​\n 28\n%\n​\n 16\n%\n​\nPer share amounts do not necessarily sum due to rounding.\n​\nCurrency translation had an unfavorable ($0.09) impact on reported and adjusted diluted EPS when comparing 2024 to 2023 and unfavorable ($0.05) impact when comparing 2023 to 2022. \n​\n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSEGMENT PERFORMANCE\n​\nThe non-U.S. dollar functional currency international amounts included within our reportable segments are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed currency exchange rates established by management for 2024.

Water organic sales increased 8% in 2023 driven by strong pricing and new business wins. Light water reported strong sales growth in 2024 driven by strong performance across institutional, food & beverage and high-tech and good sales growth in 2023 driven by strong performance across high-tech and institutional. Heavy water in 2024 reported sales growth driven by new business wins that overcame softer market trends in primary metals and chemicals and good sales growth in 2023 driven by strong pricing, gains in primary metals and growth in chemicals. Downstream reported\n \nstrong sales growth in 2024 driven by strong growth in refining and water management and strong growth in 2023 \ndriven by innovative water treatment programs. \nFood & Beverage\n organic sales increased 1% in 2024 as good new business wins more than offset continued soft industry trends and comparisons to last year’s strong growth. Organic sales increased 9% in 2023 reflecting continued pricing, strong performance in dairy, and solid growth in beverage & brewing and animal health. \nPaper\n organic sales were flat in 2024 as strong new business wins were offset by soft but stabilizing customer production rates. ​Organic sales decreased 1% in 2023 as pricing and new business wins were offset by easing customer production rates.\n \nOperating Income\n \nOrganic operating income and organic operating income margins for Global Industrial increased in both 2024 and 2023 when compared to prior periods.\n​\nOrganic operating income margins increased 2.0 percentage points during 2024 compared to 2023, as the 4.2 percentage point positive impacts of lower delivered product costs, strong pricing, and higher volumes were partially offset by the 2.3 percentage point negative impacts of investments in the business. Organic operating income margins increased in 2023 compared to 2022, as the positive impacts of strong pricing overcame the negative impacts of investments in business including incentive compensation, lower volume, and higher supply chain costs. \n​\n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Institutional & Specialty\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n​\n2023\n​\n2022\nSales at fixed currency (millions)\n​\n​\n $5,413.9\n​\n​\n​\n $5,014.6\n​\n​\n​\n $4,433.2\n​\nSales at public currency (millions)\n​\n​\n 5,382.6\n​\n​\n​\n 4,999.2\n​\n​\n​\n 4,432.1\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOrganic sales change\n​\n​\n 7\n%  \n​\n​\n*\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAcquisitions and divestitures\n​\n \n 1\n%  \n​\n​\n*\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFixed currency sales change\n​\n \n 8\n%  \n​\n​\n 13\n%  \n​\n​\n​\n​\nForeign currency translation\n​\n​\n -\n%  \n​\n​\n -\n%  \n​\n​\n​\n​\nPublic currency sales change\n​\n \n 8\n%  \n​\n​\n 13\n%  \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOperating income at fixed currency (millions)\n​\n​\n $1,182.7\n​\n​\n​\n $841.8\n​\n​\n​\n $631.9\n​\nOperating income at public currency (millions)\n​\n​\n 1,173.8\n​\n​\n​\n 838.7\n​\n​\n​\n 632.5\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFixed currency operating income change\n​\n​\n 40\n%  \n​\n​\n 33\n%  \n​\n​\n​\n​\nFixed currency operating income margin\n​\n \n 21.8\n%  \n​\n \n 16.8\n%  \n​\n \n 14.3\n%\nOrganic operating income change\n​\n \n 40\n%  \n​\n \n*\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOrganic operating income margin\n​\n \n 21.9\n%  \n​\n \n 16.8\n%  \n​\n​\n*\n​\nPublic currency operating income change\n​\n​\n 40\n%  \n​\n​\n 33\n%  \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n* Not meaningful\nPercentages in the above table do not necessarily sum due to rounding.\n​\nNet Sales\n​\nOrganic sales for Global Institutional & Specialty increased in 2024 continuing to significantly outperform end-market trends.

A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities. \n \nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.\n \nA schedule of our various obligations as of December 31, 2024 are summarized in the following table:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPayments Due by Period\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nLess\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nMore\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nThan\n​\n2-3\n​\n4-5\n​\nThan\n \n(millions)\n​\nTotal\n​\n1 Year\n​\nYears\n​\nYears\n​\n5 Years\n \nNotes payable\n​\n​\n $4\n​\n​\n $4\n​\n​\n $-\n​\n​\n $-\n​\n​\n $-\n​\nOne-time transition tax\n​\n \n 68\n​\n \n 32\n​\n​\n 36\n​\n​\n -\n​\n​\n -\n​\nLong-term debt\n​\n \n 7,561\n​\n \n 612\n​\n​\n 1,696\n​\n​\n 500\n​\n​\n 4,753\n​\nOperating leases\n​\n \n 809\n​\n \n 159\n​\n​\n 268\n​\n​\n 130\n​\n​\n 252\n​\nInterest*\n​\n \n 3,526\n​\n \n 295\n​\n​\n 543\n​\n​\n 379\n​\n​\n 2,309\n​\nTotal\n​\n​\n $11,968\n​\n​\n $1,102\n​\n​\n $2,543\n​\n​\n $1,009\n​\n​\n $7,314\n​\n​\n*Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year end 2024.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2024, our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $34 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.\n \nWe do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2024. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $48 million in 2025. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.\n \nWe lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.\n \n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nMarket Risk\n​\nWe enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows.\n \nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2024, we had a total of €575 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges. \n​\nWe enter into cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge certain Euro denominated exposures from our investments in certain of its Euro denominated functional currency subsidiaries. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2024, we had €1,575 million of cross-currency swap derivative contracts outstanding designated as a net investment hedge. \n​\nWe enter into cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge certain Chinese Yuan (“CNY”) denominated exposures from our investments in certain CNY denominated functional currency subsidiaries. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2024, we had CNH 3,619 million (CNH is the CNY traded in the offshore market) of cross-currency swap derivative contracts outstanding designated as a net investment hedge. \n​\nWe manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1,500 million of interest rate swaps outstanding.\n \nRefer to Note 8 for further information on our hedging activity.\n \nBased on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $262 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.\n​\n​\nGLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT \n​\nGlobal Economies\n​\nApproximately half of our sales are outside of the U.S. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results. \n​\nArgentina, Turkey and Egypt are classified as highly inflationary economies in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina, Turkey and Egypt. During 2024, sales in Argentina, Turkey and Egypt represented approximately 1% of our consolidated sales. Assets held in Argentina, Turkey and Egypt at the end of 2024 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets. \n​\nIn light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia by the United States and other countries, we have made the determination to limit our Russian business to operations that are essential to life, providing minimal support for our healthcare, life sciences, food and beverage and certain water businesses. We may further narrow our presence in Russia depending on future developments, such as the imposition of additional sanctions by the United States. Our Russian and Ukraine operations represented approximately 1% of our 2024 consolidated net sales. We recorded charges of $1.4 million and $13.1 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to recoverability risk of certain assets in both Russia and Ukraine. We cannot predict the progress or outcome of world geopolitical events, including the Russia and Ukraine conflict, or the consequences thereof. \n​\n​\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n​\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2.\n​\n​\n​\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n​\nIn February 2025, we entered into cross-currency swap derivative contracts with notional amounts of €300 million and CAD 280 million. These cross-currency swap derivative contracts are designated as net investment hedges of our Euro or CAD denominated exposures from our investments in certain of our Euro or CAD denominated functional currency subsidiaries.\n​\nEffective in the first quarter of 2025, we modified our organizational structure. As a result, our Global Industrial reportable segment was renamed Global Water and includes the Light & Heavy (previously named Water), Food & Beverage, and Paper operating segments. Our Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment continues to include the Institutional and Specialty operating segments. Our former healthcare operating segment moved into the Institutional operating segment. Global Life Sciences was elevated to a standalone reportable segment. The Global Pest Elimination segment remains a standalone reportable segment.\n​\n​\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n​\nThis MD&A includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include:\n \n●\n  \nFixed currency sales\n●\n  \nAdjusted net sales\n●\n  \nAdjusted fixed currency sales\n●\n  \nOrganic sales, formerly known as acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales\n●\n  \nAdjusted cost of sales\n●\n  \nAdjusted gross margin\n●\n  \nFixed currency operating income\n●\n  \nFixed currency operating income margin\n●\n  \nAdjusted operating income\n●\n  \nAdjusted operating income margin\n●\n  \nAdjusted fixed currency operating income\n●\n  \nAdjusted fixed currency operating income margin\n●\n  \nOrganic operating income, formerly known as acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income\n●\n  \nOrganic operating income margin, formerly known as acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin\n●\n  \nAdjusted other (income) expense\n●\n  \nAdjusted interest expense, net\n●\n  \nEBITDA\n●\n  \nAdjusted tax rate\n●\n  \nAdjusted net income attributable to Ecolab\n●\n  \nAdjusted diluted EPS\n​\nWe provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.\n \nOur non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, operating income and other (income) expense exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and our non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for tax rate, net income attributable to Ecolab and diluted earnings per share further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges.\n \nEBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used in our net debt to EBITDA ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. \n​\nWe evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2024. We also provide our segment results based on public currency rates for informational purposes.\n​\nOur reportable segments do not include the impact of intangible asset amortization from the Nalco and Purolite transactions or the impact of special (gains) and charges as these are not allocated to our reportable segments.\n​\n​\n46\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur non-GAAP financial measures for organic sales, organic operating income and organic operating income margin are at fixed currency and exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition and the results of divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture. Further, due to the sale of the global surgical solutions business on August 1, 2024, we have excluded the results of the business for August through December 2023 from these organic measures for the years ended December 31, 2023 to remain comparable to the corresponding period in 2024. As part of the separation of ChampionX in 2020, we entered into an agreement with ChampionX to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a transitionary period. Transitionary period sales of product to ChampionX under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in Corporate along with the related cost of sales. The remaining sales to ChampionX are recorded in product and equipment sales in the Global Industrial segment along with the related cost of sales. These transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\n​\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts in this MD&A.\n​\n​\n​",
