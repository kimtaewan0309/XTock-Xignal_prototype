See “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” preceding Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe are the leading global structural heart disease innovation company, driven by a passion to improve patient lives. Through breakthrough technologies, world-class evidence, and partnerships with clinicians and healthcare stakeholders, our employees are inspired by our patient-focused culture to deliver life-changing innovations to those who need them most. We conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions: United States, Europe, Japan, and Rest of World. Our products are categorized into the following groups: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (“TAVR”), Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (“TMTT”), and Surgical Structural Heart (“Surgical”).\nOn September 3, 2024, we sold our Critical Care product group (“Critical Care”). In addition, as a next step in our disposal plan to exit businesses that are not focused on implantable medical innovations for structural heart disease, we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell a non-core product group for $85 million up-front consideration, subject to customary adjustments, and additional earnouts of up to $40 million. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025. We concluded that Critical Care met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale in June 2024 and that the non-core product group met the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale in September 2024. We determined that, when considered together, the conditions for discontinued operations presentation had been met with respect to Critical Care and the non-core product group (collectively, the “discontinued product groups”). As such, the historical financial condition and results of the discontinued product groups have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated condensed financial statements. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the discontinued operations presentation. Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations is reflective of our continuing operations. See Note 4 to the \nConsolidated Condensed Financial Statements\n for further information. \nIn response to recent changes to U.S. trade policy, such as increased tariffs on imports and including non-U.S. retaliatory tariffs, we have and will continue to assess potential impacts on our business. As needed, we will pursue options to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including through our supply chain and potential exemptions and exclusions. Failure to sufficiently mitigate the impact of tariffs, including significant inflation and other impacts on our customers, could also reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Given the uncertainties around U.S. trade policy and future tariff rates, we are unable to predict the nature of the tariffs and whether we will be able to successfully mitigate their impact.\n33\nTable of\n \nC\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt\ns\nFinancial Highlights\nOur net sales for the first nine months of 2025 were $4.5 billion, representing an increase of $444.3 million compared to the first nine months of 2024, driven primarily by sales of our TAVR and TMTT products. \nOur gross profit increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, driven primarily by our sales growth. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to impact from foreign currency rate fluctuations and higher operational expenses. The decrease in our diluted earnings per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was driven by our aforementioned operational performance.\n \nHealthcare Environment, Opportunities, and Challenges\nThe medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve. We measure our success both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders. We are committed to developing new technologies and innovations, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property in support of those developments. Our vision for growth is to treat patients with both valvular and non-valvular structural heart disease, such as heart failure, which is a natural progression of the disease for many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.\nWe are dedicated to generating robust clinical, economic, and quality-of-life evidence that is increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the current healthcare environment, with the goal of encouraging the adoption of innovative new medical therapies that demonstrate superior outcomes.\nNew Accounting Standards\nInformation on new accounting standards is included in Note 1 to the \nConsolidated Condensed Financial Statements\n.\n34\nTable of\n \nC\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt\ns\nResults of Operations\nNet Sales by Region\n(dollars in millions)\n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n \nPercent Change\nPercent Change\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\nUnited States\n$\n907.5 \n$\n804.6 \n$\n102.9 \n12.8 \n%\n$\n2,636.1 \n$\n2,393.1 \n$\n243.0 \n10.2 \n%\nEurope\n387.9 \n319.8 \n68.1 \n21.3 \n%\n1,107.9 \n978.0 \n129.9 \n13.3 \n%\nJapan\n90.1 \n81.4 \n8.7 \n10.6 \n%\n267.2 \n253.9 \n13.3 \n5.2 \n%\nRest of World\n167.6 \n148.6 \n19.0 \n12.7 \n%\n486.8 \n428.7 \n58.1 \n13.5 \n%\nOutside of the United States\n645.6 \n549.8 \n95.8 \n17.4 \n%\n1,861.9 \n1,660.6 \n201.3 \n12.1 \n%\nTotal net sales\n$\n1,553.1 \n$\n1,354.4 \n$\n198.7 \n14.7 \n%\n$\n4,498.0 \n$\n4,053.7 \n$\n444.3 \n11.0 \n%\nNet sales outside of the United States include the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as further detailed in the discussion below.

In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales outside of the United States by $17.0 million and $13.2 million, respectively, primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against the United States dollar.\nIn April 2025, we received United States Food and Drug Administration approval for the \nSAPIEN 3 \nplatform for severe aortic stenosis patients without symptoms.\n36\nTable of\n \nC\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt\ns\nTranscatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies Sales\n \nNet sales of TMTT products increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to higher sales of our \nPASCAL \ntranscatheter edge-to-edge repair system and our continued launch of the \nEVOQUE\n tricuspid valve replacement system in the United States and Europe.\nIn April 2025, we received a CE Mark for the \nEdwards SAPIEN M3\n mitral valve replacement system for the transcatheter treatment of patients with symptomatic (moderate-to-severe or severe) mitral regurgitation who are deemed unsuitable for surgery or transcatheter edge-to-edge therapy.\n \n37\nTable of\n \nC\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt\ns\nSurgical Structural Heart Sales\nNet sales of Surgical products increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to higher sales of the \nINSPIRIS RESILIA\n aortic valve in the United States, Europe and Rest of World, the \nMITRIS RESILIA \nvalve in the United States, Europe, and China, and the\n KONECT RESILIA \ntissue valved conduit in the United States.\nIn June 2025, we received a CE Mark for the KONECT RESILIA aortic valved conduit, the first ready-to-implant solution with RESILIA tissue specifically designed for bio-Bentall procedures.\n38\nTable of\n \nC\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt\ns\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily driven by our sales growth discussed above. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily driven by a 1.1 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency rate fluctuations, including the settlement of foreign currency hedging contracts, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and higher operational expenses for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nSelling, General, and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to (a) higher field-based personnel-related costs in support of our growth strategy initiatives, primarily in the United States (b) increased performance-based compensation expenses, and (b) increased professional services costs to support the transition services agreement. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased expenses by $7.3 million and $1.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to the weakening of United States dollar against the Euro.\n39\nTable of\n \nC\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt\ns\nResearch and Development (“R&D”) Expenses\nR&D expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to increased clinical activity related to our recent investments in implantable heart failure management innovations and higher performance-based compensation expense, partially offset by decreased investments in our transcatheter aortic valve innovations.\nCertain Litigation Expenses\nWe incurred certain litigation expenses related to legal proceedings, intellectual property litigation and tax litigation of $90.4 million and $10.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $116.8 million and $27.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively (See Note 11 to the \nConsolidated Condensed Financial Statements\n).\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Liabilities\nThe change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities resulted in net gain of $12.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. The net gain was primarily due to changes in projected probabilities of milestone achievements. There were no changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nIntangible Assets Impairment Charges\nIntangible assets impairment charges of $40.0 million in three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 related to full impairment of certain developed technology assets. There were no intangible assets impairment charges recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nOther Operating (Income) Expense\nOther operating income, net of $12.5 million and $52.9 million in three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, included income from a transition services agreement of $12.7 million and $50.5 million, respectively (see Note 4 to the \nConsolidated Condensed Financial Statements\n).\nInterest Income\nInterest income was $38.6 million and $112.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, and $24.3 million and $56.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to a higher average investment balance during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.\n40\nTable of\n \nC\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt\ns\nLoss on Impairment\nLoss on impairment of $47.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 included loss on impairment related to our determination to not exercise an option to acquire one of our VIE investments (see Note 6 to the \nConsolidated Condensed Financial Statements)\n.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside the United States which have statutory tax rates typically lower than the United States tax rate. Accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in the various locations and the applicable rates. \nOur effective income tax rate attributable to continuing operations was 16.1% and 10.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 16.1% and 9.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in the effective rate between the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was primarily due to \nan increase in global minimum tax (“Pillar Two,” as noted below), a decrease in the tax benefit from employee share-based compensation, and a decrease in the benefit from favorable global income tax audit settlements. In addition, the effective rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to (1) foreign earnings taxed at lower rates, (2) United States f\nederal and California research and development credits, and (3) the tax benefit from employee share-based compensation. The effective rates include a tax benefit (shortfall) from employee share-based compensation attributable to continuing operations of \n$(0.3) million\n and \n$0.6 million\n for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively\n, and $0.8 million\n and \n$10.1 million\n for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nMany countries are implementing some or all of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar Two (“Pillar Two”) rules that impose a global minimum tax of 15% on reported profits. Although Pillar Two provides a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar Two slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines and may adjust domestic tax incentives in response to Pillar Two. In addition, in January 2025, the United States issued an executive order announcing opposition to aspects of these rules. As countries continue to enact and refine the Pillar Two rules, we will evaluate the potential effects of Pillar Two on our effective tax rate. In 2025, we expect the Pillar Two provisions to result in additional tax expense of approximately $50 million.\nIn the normal course of business, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other taxing authorities are in different stages of examining various years of our tax filings. During these audits, we may receive proposed audit adjustments that could be material. Therefore, there is a possibility that an adverse outcome in these audits could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach an agreement with a tax authority at any time. While we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is materially different from that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal. The uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law. We believe that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided for any adjustments that may result from our uncertain tax positions.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we executed an Advance Pricing Agreement (“APA”) between Japan and Switzerland covering distribution transactions for tax years 2020 through 2024, and in 2023, we executed an APA between Japan and the United States covering tax years 2020 through 2024. We also executed an APA in the fourth quarter of 2024 between Japan and Singapore covering tax years 2022 through 2026 with roll-back terms to cover the distribution of TAVR products beginning in 2020 and the distribution of Surgical products beginning in 2018. Also in the fourth quarter of 2024, we filed with the Japanese tax authorities an APA renewal application between Japan and the United States covering tax years 2025 through 2029. We filed the APA renewal application with the United States tax authorities in the first quarter of 2025 and are engaged in ongoing discussions. \n41\nTable of\n \nC\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt\ns\nThe audits of our United States federal income tax returns through 2014 have been closed. The IRS audit field work for the 2015 through 2017 tax years was completed during the second quarter of 2021, except for transfer pricing and related matters. The IRS is currently examining the 2018 through 2020 tax years. At September 30, 2025, all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2015.\nDuring 2021, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”) from the IRS for the 2015 through 2017 tax years relating to transfer pricing involving Surgical/TAVR intercompany royalty transactions between our United States and Switzerland subsidiaries. The NOPA proposed a substantial increase to our United States taxable income, which could result in additional tax expense for the 2015 through 2017 period of approximately $255 million and reflects a departure from a transfer pricing method we had previously agreed upon with the IRS. We disagreed with the NOPA and pursued an administrative appeal with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (“Appeals”). The Appeals process culminated in the third quarter of 2023 when we and Appeals concluded that a satisfactory resolution of the matter at the administrative level was not possible.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, Appeals issued a notice of deficiency (“NOD”) increasing our 2015 through 2017 United States federal income tax in amounts resulting from the income adjustments previously reflected in the NOPA. The additional tax sought in excess of our filing position is $269.3 million before consideration of interest and a repatriation tax offset.\nWe plan to vigorously contest the additional tax claimed by the IRS through the judicial process. Final resolution of this matter is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe the amounts previously accrued related to this uncertain tax position are appropriate for a number of reasons, including the interpretation and application of relevant tax laws and accounting standards to our facts and, accordingly, have not accrued any additional amount based on the NOD and other proceedings to date. Nonetheless, the outcome of the judicial process cannot be predicted with certainty, and it is possible that the outcome of that process could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. As noted below, similar material tax disputes may arise for the 2018 through 2024 tax years. We made deposits with the IRS of $75 million in November 2022, and $305.1 million in March 2024, to prevent the further accrual of interest on that portion of any additional tax and interest we may ultimately be found to owe while we prepare to contest through the judicial process the IRS's entitlement to any of the additional tax claimed by the IRS. The IRS converted those deposits to advance payments, and, on December 20, 2024, we filed administrative claims for refunds of those payments with the IRS for the 2015 through 2017 tax years. Though the IRS could still deny those refund claims, we are now able to sue for refunds in the appropriate judicial forum even without an IRS denial.\nSurgical/TAVR intercompany royalty transactions covering tax years 2018 through 2024 remain subject to IRS examination, and those transactions and related tax positions remain uncertain as of September 30, 2025. We have considered this information, as well as information regarding the NOD and other proceedings described above, in our evaluation of our uncertain tax positions. The impact of these unresolved transfer pricing matters, net of any correlative tax adjustments, may be significant to our consolidated financial statements. Based on the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and, therefore, have continued to record the uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we received a notice of assessment from the Israel Tax Authority (the “ITA”) wherein the ITA claimed that we owe approximately $110 million of tax excluding interest and penalties in connection with a claimed 2017 transfer of intellectual property. On July 31, 2025, the ITA formally informed us that it was withdrawing its 2017 assessment but reserves the right to evaluate whether intellectual property was transferred in later years. We maintain that we did not transfer intellectual property outside of Israel and would vigorously defend that position through administrative proceedings including with appeals if the issue is raised in later years. If necessary, we expect to defend that position through judicial proceedings. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we received a notice of assessment from the ITA claiming that we owe additional tax of approximately $16 million excluding interest and penalties for the 2018 through 2022 tax years based entirely on the collateral impacts of the 2017 assessment. We filed a formal appeal in the first quarter of 2025 and, if necessary, expect to defend its position through judicial proceedings. While the appeals process for the 2018 through 2022 years runs through March 2026, we expect the 2018 through 2022 assessment to also be withdrawn prior to expiration of the appeals process based on the ITA’s conclusion that IP was not transferred in 2017.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was signed into law. The OBBBA includes significant provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, \n42\nTable of\n \nC\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt\ns\nmodifications to the international tax framework, and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through 2027. The OBBBA did not have a material impact to our estimated annual effective rate for 2025 and we are currently evaluating the potential impact on future periods.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash from operations, and amounts available under credit facilities. We believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current and long-term requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments. However, we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may, from time to time, seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. \nAs of September 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments held in the United States and outside of the United States were $3.4 billion and $438.0 million, respectively. \nWe have a Five-year Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which provides for a $750.0 million multi-currency unsecured revolving credit facility and matures on July 15, 2027. We may increase the amount available under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $250.0 million in the aggregate and extend the maturity date for an additional year, subject to agreement of the lenders. As of September 30, 2025, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nIn June 2018, we issued $600.0 million of 4.3% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes (the “2018 Notes”) due June 15, 2028. We may redeem the 2018 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at specified redemption prices. As of September 30, 2025, we have not elected to redeem any of the 2018 Notes. As of September 30, 2025, the carrying value of the 2018 Notes was $598.2 million.\nFrom time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. We consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, expected dilution from stock plans, cash capacity, and the market price of our common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, under the Board authorized repurchase program, we repurchased a total of 11.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $844.9 million, including pursuant to  $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreements executed during the period (see Note 10 to the \nConsolidated Condensed Financial Statements\n). As of September 30, 2025, we had remaining authority to purchase $2.1 billion of our common stock under the share repurchase program.\nIn July 2024, we entered into agreements and plans of mergers to acquire multiple medical device companies for a total aggregate cash purchase price of $1.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments. Three of these transactions closed in 2024, and upon closing we paid $1.1 billion. These three agreements include up to an additional $225.0 million of potential payments upon achievement of certain regulatory, performance, and sales milestones. The remaining agreement is expected to close in 2026 for an aggregate cash purchase price of $500.0 million, subject to certain adjustments, plus up to an additional $445.0 million upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones.\n We have purchased options to acquire and have agreed to provide promissory notes to various entities. These arrangements could result in additional cash outlays in the future should we decide to exercise the options or should the entities draw on the promissory notes.\nAt September 30, 2025, there had been no material changes in our cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations, including commitments for capital expenditures, as disclosed in Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n43\nTable of\n \nC\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt\ns\nConsolidated Cash Flows - For the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024: \n \n \nNet cash flows provided by \noperating activities\n of $1,144.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased $474.5 million over the same period last year primarily due to (1) lower tax payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, which included $175.3 million of local tax payments associated with the sale of Critical Care, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included a $305.1 million tax deposit we made to mitigate interest on potential tax liabilities we are contesting through the judicial process (see Note 14 to the \nConsolidated Condensed Financial Statements\n), and (2) improved operating performance.\nNet cash used in \ninvesting activities\n of $514.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $198.5 million, capital expenditures of $162.8 million, an issuance of notes receivable of $93.4 million, a payment for a net working capital adjustment of $36.3 million related to the sale of Critical Care, and payment of acquisition options of $19.6 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities of $2.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted primarily of the sale of our Critical Care product group for proceeds of $3.9 billion, partially offset by capital expenditures of $202.6 million and net proceeds from investments of $2.3 million.\nNet cash used in \nfinancing activities\n of $945.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $852.8 million and purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary of $233.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $141.8 million. \nNet cash used in financing activities of $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $1.2 billion, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $150.9 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated condensed financial statements and sales and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Information with respect to our critical accounting policies and estimates which we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management is contained in Item 7, \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\n of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. There have been no significant changes from the information discussed therein.\n44\nTable of\n \nC\no\nn\nt\ne\nn\nt\ns"
