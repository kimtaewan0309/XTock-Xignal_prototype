None of the Company’s U.S.-based employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and the Company is not aware of any current efforts to enter into such agreements. \nTalent Attraction, Development and Retention.\nEverest is proud to be home to top industry talent, and we make ongoing, strategic investments in our people. Our ability to attract, develop and retain a high caliber of professionals is critical to our continued growth and ability to execute on our strategic priorities.\nInvesting in the ongoing development of our colleagues is fundamental to our success and sustained competitive advantage as a global leader in risk management.

We are taking a systematic approach to integrating them into everything we do, from our talent acquisition and onboarding programs to our performance and compensation plans, recognition initiatives and general employment policies.\nPeople are Everest’s greatest asset, and the quality of our teams has been enhanced through the wide range of backgrounds, perspectives and interests our colleagues bring to our community. At Everest, our commitment to equal opportunity in our dealings and cultural inclusivity reflects a core principle that we promote not only within our workplace but also in the global communities where we operate.  Our Board is committed to selecting director and executive management candidates who possess unique skill sets, experiences and perspectives that enhance our governance, strategy, corporate responsibility, culture and risk management.\nEverest has a global inclusion, culture and engagement strategic framework and focus areas that aligns with our corporate values and initiatives.  In 2024, we had four pillars providing the foundation for our strategic framework as described below.\n1.\nAlignment & Accountability: Our integrated global efforts align with our corporate strategy, cultural values and colleague behaviors.\n2.\nColleague-Centered: Our colleagues are the center of the global programs, processes and partnerships we create, and we value and respect their diverse experiences and perspectives. \n3.\nCulture & Engagement: Our workplace culture of deep colleague engagement thrives because of our efforts to advance inclusion, allyship and belonging.\n4.\nOpportunity & Growth: Our global efforts and ways to underwrite opportunity for all stakeholders are oriented toward growth, and we have the agility to pivot as necessary to support our strategic priorities. \nAs part of our global inclusion, culture and engagement efforts, our mission is to help foster an environment that attracts, retains and develops the best talent; prioritizes people, their life experiences and perspectives; and serves as a conduit to senior management to promote measurable company-wide engagement. \nWe look to seize opportunities to celebrate our culture and lift one another up.

Our CRGs and BRGs support our efforts in the areas of volunteerism, sustainability and innovation.\nBusiness and Underwriting Strategy.\nSince 2023, Everest Group, Ltd. trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol (NYSE: EG). Everest’s value proposition is built on five decades of reinsurance leadership and an expanding presence in the global primary insurance market.\nThe Company writes business on a worldwide basis for many different customers and lines of business, thereby obtaining a broad spread of risk.  The Company is not substantially dependent on any single customer, small group of customers, line of business or geographic area.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, no single customer (ceding company or insured) generated \nmore than \n3.9%\n \nof the Company’s gross written premiums.  The Company believes that a reduction of business from any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on its future financial condition or results of operations.\nApproximately 64.8%, 28.5% and 6.7% of the Company’s 2024 gross written premiums were written in the broker reinsurance market, the insurance business and the direct reinsurance market, respectively.  \nThe broker reinsurance market consists of several substantial national and international brokers and a number of smaller specialized brokers.  Brokers do not have the authority to bind the Company with respect to reinsurance agreements, nor \n4\nTable of Contents\ndoes the Company commit in advance to accept any portion of a broker’s submitted business.  Reinsurance business from any ceding company, whether new or renewal is subject to acceptance by the Company.  Brokerage fees are generally paid by reinsurers.  The Reinsurance segment’s ten largest brokers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 60.5% of gross written premiums in 2024.  The broker with the largest share of the company’s business, Marsh and McLennan, accounted for approximately 21.9% of gross written premiums.  The broker with the next-largest share, Aon, accounted for approximately 19.2% of gross written premiums.  The Company believes that a reduction of business assumed from any one broker would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.  \nThe Company’s Insurance segment mainly writes commercial property and casualty business on an admitted and non-admitted basis.  The business is writ\nten through wholesale and retail brokers, surplus lines brokers and through program administrators.  In 2024, no program administrator accounted for more than \n5.5%\n of the Insurance segment’s gross written premium in total\n.\nThe direct reinsurance market is an important distribution channel for reinsurance business written by the Company.  Direct placement of reinsurance enables the Company to access clients who prefer to place their reinsurance directly with reinsurers based upon the reinsurer’s in-depth understanding of the ceding company’s needs.\nIt is our long-standing client and broker relationships that help us continue to grow and maintain our global leadership position. The Company continually evaluates each business relationship, including within its distribution channel bearing underwriting expertise and experience, performs analyses to evaluate financial security, monitors performance and adjusts underwriting decisions accordingly.\nThe Company’s business strategy is to sustain its leadership position within targeted reinsurance and insurance markets and provide effective management throughout the property and casualty underwriting cycle, thereby achieving an attractive return for its shareholders.  The Company’s underwriting strategies seek to capitalize on what we believe are our financial strength and capacity, global franchise, stable and experienced management team, diversified product and distribution offerings, underwriting expertise and disciplined approach, efficient and low-cost operating structure and effective enterprise risk management practices.  \nThe Company’s underwriting strategies emphasize disciplined underwriting, prioritizing underwriting profitability over premium volume and flexibility to adjust and respond to changing market conditions.  Key elements of these strategies, as applicable to the Reinsurance segment, include careful risk selection, appropriate pricing through strict underwriting discipline and adjustments to the Company’s business mix as market conditions change.  We focus on (re)insuring companies that effectively manage their own underwriting cycle through proper analysis and appropriate pricing of underlying risks and whose underwriting guidelines and performance are compatible with their and the Company’s objectives.  Key elements of the Company’s underwriting strategies, as applicable to the Insurance segment, include careful expansion on what we believe to be the Company’s existing strengths in the primary insurance market, including its broad underwriting expertise, global presence, strong financial ratings and substantial capital, and facilitating adjustments to its mix of business by geographic region, line of business and type of coverage.  These strategies allow Everest to fully participate in market opportunities that provide the greatest potential for underwriting profitability.  The Company’s insurance and reinsurance operations allow the Company to execute its strategies by providing access to the global business markets.  The Company carefully monitors its mix of business across all operations to seek to avoid unacceptable geographic or other risk concentrations. \nSegments Overview.\nThe Company conducts business through two reportable segments, Reinsurance and Insurance, which are managed as autonomous units, and key strategic decisions are based on the aggregate operating results and projections for the two business segments.  \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company revised its classification and presentation of certain run-off business, previously included within the Reinsurance and Insurance reportable segments, as part of a new segment called \"Other\".  The new Other segment includes the results of our sports and leisure business sold in October 2024, consisting of policies written prior to the sale and polices renewed and certain new business written on the Company’s paper post-sale. It also includes run-off asbestos and environmental exposures, certain discontinued insurance programs primarily written prior to 2012 and certain discontinued insurance and reinsurance coverage classes.   The Other segment does not generally sell insurance or reinsurance products but is responsible for the management of existing policies and settlement of related losses.  Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company revised the classification and presentation of certain \n5\nTable of Contents\nproducts related to its accident and health business within the reportable segment groupings. These products have been realigned from within the Reinsurance segment to the Insurance segment to appropriately reflect how the business segments are managed due to changes in management implemented during the fourth quarter of 2023.  These segment presentation changes have been reflected retrospectively. The Company will continue to have two reportable segments that actively sell products, Reinsurance and Insurance, consistent with how the on-going business is managed.  \nThe Reinsurance segment writes worldwide property and casualty reinsurance and specialty lines of business, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies. Business is written in the United States, Bermuda and Ireland offices, as well as through branches in Canada, Singapore, the U.K. and Switzerland.  The Insurance segment writes property and casualty insurance directly and through brokers, including for surplus lines, and general agents within the United States, Bermuda, Canada, Europe, Singapore and South America through its offices in the United States, Bermuda, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Singapore, the U.K., Ireland and branches located in Australia, the U.K., the Netherlands, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\nThe two reportable segments are managed independently but conform with corporate guidelines with respect to pricing, risk management, control of aggregate catastrophe exposures, capital, investments and support operations.  Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of the two reportable segments based upon their underwriting results.\nUnderwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses.  We measure our underwriting results using ratios, in particular, loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which, respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by premiums earned.  For selected financial information regarding these segments, see ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -  Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” and ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Segment Results”.\nReinsurance Segment\n.  \nOverview\nReinsurance is an arrangement in which an (re)insurance company, the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company, the ceding company, against all or a portion of the risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more insurance and/or reinsurance contracts.  Reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits, including a reduction in its net liability on individual risks or classes of risks, catastrophe protection from large and/or multiple losses and/or a reduction in operating leverage as measured by the ratio of net premiums and reserves to capital.  Reinsurance also provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more business than would be acceptable relative to the ceding company’s financial resources.  Reinsurance does not discharge the ceding company from its liability to policyholders; rather, it reimburses the ceding company for covered losses. \nThere are two types of reinsurance arrangements: treaty and facultative.  Treaty reinsurance obligates the ceding company to cede and the reinsurer to assume a specified portion of a type or category of risks insured by the ceding company.  Treaty reinsurers do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under their treaties; instead, \nthe reinsurer evaluates portfolio level exposure based on information provided by the ceding company.  I\nn facultative reinsurance, the ceding company cedes, and the reinsurer assumes, all or part of the risk under a single insurance contract. Facultative reinsurance is negotiated separately for each insurance contract that is reinsured.  Facultative reinsurance, when purchased by ceding companies, usually is intended to cover individual risks not covered by their reinsurance treaties because of the dollar limits involved or because the risk is unusual. \nBoth treaty and facultative reinsurance can be written on either a pro rata basis or an excess of loss basis.  Under pro rata reinsurance, the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion.  Under excess of loss reinsurance, the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses and expenses in excess of a specified dollar amount, known as the ceding company's retention or reinsurer's attachment point, generally subject to a negotiated reinsurance contract limit. \nIn pro rata reinsurance, the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission.  The ceding commission generally is based on the ceding company’s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured (such as commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative expenses, and may contain profit sharing provisions, \n6\nTable of Contents\nwhereby the ceding commission is adjusted based on loss experience).  Premiums paid by the ceding company to a reinsurer for excess of loss reinsurance are not directly proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk.  There is usually no ceding commission on treaty excess of loss reinsurance.\nReinsurers may purchase reinsurance to cover their own risk exposure. Reinsurance of a reinsurer's business is called a retrocession.  Reinsurance companies cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers, known as retrocessionaires, for reasons similar to those that cause insurers to purchase reinsurance: to reduce net liability on individual or classes of risks, protect against catastrophic losses, stabilize financial ratios and obtain additional underwriting capacity. All the Company’s reinsurance and retrocessional agreements transfer significant reinsurance risk and therefore, are accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with GAAP guidance.\nReinsurance can be written through intermediaries, generally professional reinsurance brokers, or directly with ceding companies.  From a ceding company's perspective, the broker and the direct distribution channels have advantages and disadvantages.  A ceding company's decision to select one distribution channel over the other will be influenced by its perception of such advantages and disadvantages relative to the reinsurance coverage being placed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s Reinsurance segment wrote $12.9 billion of gross written premiums.  Reinsurance business written directly through the broker reinsurance market represented $11.7 billion or 90.5% of the segment’s premium and $1.2 billion or 9.5% was written directly with ceding companies.

Claims are allocated to the Claims staff according to their expertise and experience and most specialize in particular product segments and geographies. Some insurance claims are handled by third party claims service providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the Claims staff. The Claims staff work closely with senior management in Insurance, as well as underwriting, finance and actuarial.\nReinsurance claims are also managed by the Company’s Claims staff whose responsibilities include reviewing initial loss reports and coverage issues, monitoring claims, handling activities of ceding companies, establishing and adjusting proper case reserves and approving payment of claims.  In addition to claims assessment, processing and payment, the Claims staff selectively conducts comprehensive claim audits of both specific claims and overall claim procedures at the offices of selected ceding companies.  Some reinsurance claims are handled by third party claims service providers who have limited authority and are subject to oversight by the Company’s Claims staff.  The Claims staff works closely with senior management in Reinsurance, as well as underwriting, finance and actuarial.\nThe Company intensively manages its asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) exposures through a dedicated, centrally managed Claims staff with experienced claim and legal professionals who specialize in the handling of such exposures.  They actively manage each individual insured and reinsured account, responding to claim developments with evaluations of the involved exposures and adjustment of reserves, as appropriate.  Specific or general claim developments that may have material implications for the Company are regularly communicated to senior management, actuarial, legal and financial areas.  Senior management and claim management personnel meet at least quarterly to review the Company’s overall reserve positions and make changes, if appropriate.  The Company continually reviews its internal processing, communications and analytics, seeking to enhance the management of its A&E exposures, in particular with respect to changes in asbestos claims and litigation.\nLoss Reserves.\nReserves for Unpaid Property and Casualty Losses and LAE.\nSignificant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the reinsurer, the payment of that loss by the insurer and subsequent payments to the insurer by the reinsurer.  To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and LAE, insurers and reinsurers establish reserves, which are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses for losses that have already occurred.  To the extent reserves prove to be insufficient to cover actual losses and LAE after taking into account available reinsurance coverage, the Company would have to recognize such reserve shortfalls and incur a charge to earnings, which could be material in the period such recognition takes place.  See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Loss and LAE Reserves”.\nAs part of the reserving process, insurers and reinsurers evaluate historical data and trends and make judgments as to the impact of various factors, such as legislative and judicial developments that may affect future claim amounts, changes in social and political attitudes that may increase loss exposures and inflationary and general economic trends. While the reserving process is difficult and subjective for insurance companies, the inherent uncertainties of estimating such reserves are even greater for the reinsurer, due primarily to the longer time between the date of an occurrence and the reporting of any attendant claims to the reinsurer, the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts, the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies. In addition, trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development in the same manner or to the same degree in the future.  As a result, actual losses and LAE may deviate, perhaps substantially, from estimates of reserves reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements. \nThe Company’s loss and LAE reserves represent management’s best estimate of the Company’s ultimate liability.  Management’s best estimate is developed through collaboration with actuarial, underwriting, claims, legal and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees. Each segment’s reserve committee includes the participation of the relevant parties from actuarial, finance, claims and the segment’s senior management.  Reserves are \n10\nTable of Contents\nfurther reviewed by Everest’s Chief Reserving Actuary and senior management.  The objective of such process is to determine a single best estimate viewed by management to be the best estimate of its ultimate loss liability.   While there can be no assurance that these reserves will not need to be increased in the future, management believes that the Company’s existing reserves and reserving methodologies reduce the likelihood that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  \nLike many other property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company has experienced loss development for prior accident years, which has impacted losses and LAE reserves and caused corresponding effects to income (loss) in the periods in which the adjustments were made.  There can be no assurance that adverse development from prior years will not occur in the future or that such adverse development will not have a material adverse effect on net income (loss).\nSince the Company has operations in many countries, part of the Company’s loss and LAE reserves are in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for each reporting period.  Fluctuations in the exchange rates for the currencies, period over period, affect the U.S. dollar amount of outstanding reserves.  The translation adjustment eliminates the impact of the exchange fluctuations from the reserve re-estimates.  For reconciliation of beginning and ending reserves, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nReserves for Asbestos and Environmental Loss and LAE.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company’s gross reserves for A&E claims represented 0.9% of its total reserves.  The results of run-off A&E exposures are included within the Company’s Other segment.  The Company’s A&E liabilities stem from direct insurance business from Mt. McKinley Insurance Company (“Mt. McKinley”) and assumed reinsurance business of Everest Re.  Mt. McKinley was a former wholly-owned subsidiary that was sold in 2015 to Clearwater Insurance Company (“Clearwater”), a subsidiary of Fairfax Financial. \nConcurrently with the closing of such sale, the Company entered into a retrocession treaty with an affiliate of Clearwater.  Per the retrocession treaty, the Company retroceded 100% of the liabilities associated with certain Mt. McKinley policies, which had been reinsured by Bermuda Re. As consideration for entering into the retrocession treaty, Bermuda Re transferred cash of $140.3 million, an amount equal to the net loss reserves as of the closing date.  Of the $140.3 million of net loss reserves retroceded, $100.5 million were related to A&E business.  The maximum liability retroceded under the retrocession treaty is $440.3 million, equal to the retrocession payment plus $300.0 million.  Bermuda Re will retain liability for any amounts exceeding the maximum liability retroceded under the retrocession treaty.\nOn December 20, 2019, the retrocession treaty was amended and included a partial commutation.  As a result of this amendment and partial commutation, gross A&E reserves and the corresponding reinsurance receivable were reduced by $43.4 million.  In addition, the maximum liability permitted to be retroceded increased to $450.3 million.\nAdditional losses, including those relating to latent injuries and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized and the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by either the Company or the industry, may emerge in the future. Such future emergence could have material adverse effects on the Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the Company’s potential losses from A&E claims and ultimate values cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques.  See ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asbestos and Environmental Exposures” and ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  \nInvestments.\nThe board of directors of each of the Company’s operating subsidiaries is responsible for establishing investment policy and guidelines and, together with senior management, for overseeing their execution.  \nThe Company’s principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a high-quality diversified investment portfolio.  Considering these objectives, the Company views its investment portfolio as having two components: (1) the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities (i.e., its core fixed maturities portfolio) and (2) investments funded by the Company’s shareholders’ equity.  \n11\nTable of Contents\nFor the portion needed to satisfy global outstanding liabilities, the Company generally invests in fixed maturities with strong average credit quality.  This global fixed maturity securities portfolio is managed both internally and on an external basis by independent, professional investment managers using portfolio guidelines approved by the Company.  \nThe Company has expanded the allocation of its investments funded by shareholders’ equity to include: (1) fixed and floating rate securities, (2) bank and private loan securities, (3) private equity limited partnership investments and (4) corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) policies, which are invested in debt and equity securities.  The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes.  The Company limits its allocation to these asset classes because of (i) the potential for volatility in their values and (ii) the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models.  The Company uses investment managers experienced in these markets and adjusts its allocation to these investments based upon market conditions.\nThe duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security but also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early prepayments.  The Company’s fixed income investment guidelines include a general duration guideline.  This investment duration guideline is established and periodically revised by management, which considers economic and business factors, as well as the Company’s average duration of potential liabilities, which, at December 31, 2024, is estimated at approximately 4.0 years, based on the estimated payouts of underwriting liabilities using standard duration calculations.  The average durations of the fixed income portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 3.1 years and 3.3 years, respectively.\nFinancial Strength Ratings.\nThe following table shows the current financial strength ratings of the Company’s operating subsidiaries as reported by A.M. Best, S&P and Moody’s.  These ratings represent an independent opinion of our subsidiaries’ financial strength, operating performance, business profile and ability to meet policyholder obligations. The ratings are not intended to be an indication of the degree or lack of risk involved in a direct or indirect equity investment or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities.  Additionally, rating organizations may change their rating methodology, which could have a material impact on our financial strength ratings.\nAll of the below-mentioned ratings are continually monitored and revised, if necessary, by each of the rating agencies.  The ratings presented in the following table were in effect as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company believes that its ratings are important as they provide the Company’s customers and others with an independent assessment of the Company’s financial strength using a rating scale that provides for relative comparisons.  Strong financial ratings are particularly important for reinsurance and insurance companies given that customers rely on a company to pay covered losses well into the future.  As a result, a highly rated company is generally preferred.\nOperating Subsidiary:\nA.M.

Ratings from “AA” to “CCC” may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.\n12\nTable of Contents\n(3)\n  Moody’s Financial Strength Ratings Scale: C (Low Grade) to Aaa (High Grade).  Note that Moody’s appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa.  The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category. \nA.M. Best states that the “A+” (“Superior”) rating is assigned to those companies which, in its opinion, have a superior ability to meet their ongoing insurance policies and contract obligations based on A.M. Best’s comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company’s balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile.  A.M. Best affirmed these ratings on July 19, 2024, with a stable outlook.  S&P states that the “A+”/ “A” ratings are assigned to those insurance companies which, in its opinion, have strong financial security characteristics with respect to their ability to pay under their insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms.  S&P affirmed all ratings on January 28, 2025, and changed the outlook from stable to negative.  Moody’s states that an “A1” rating is assigned to companies that, in their opinion, offer upper-medium grade security and are subject to low credit risk.  Moody’s affirmed these ratings on May 17, 2024, with a stable outlook.\nSubsidiaries other than Everest Re and Bermuda Re may not be rated by some or any rating agencies given that such ratings are not considered essential by the individual subsidiary’s customers because of the limited nature of the subsidiary’s operations or because the subsidiaries are newly established and have not yet been rated by the agencies.\nDebt Ratings.\nThe following table shows the debt ratings by A.M. Best, S&P and Moody’s of the following series of notes issued by Holdings, all of which are considered investment grade: (1) senior notes due June 1, 2044, (2) senior notes due October 15, 2050, (3) senior notes due October 15, 2052 and (4) long-term notes due May 1, 2067.

As a global insurance and reinsurance business, we have an established Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework that is integrated into the day-to-day management of our businesses and operations.  \nThe ERM framework provides a group-wide systemic approach to managing the organization’s key risks and is supported by Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Everest Board.\nRisk governance is a key component of Everest’s ERM framework in order to establish and coordinate risk guidelines that reflect the enterprise’s appetite for risk, facilitate monitoring of risk exposure relative to established guidelines and ensure effective and timely escalation and communication to management and the Board.  Risk management is overseen by Board and senior management risk committees.  The risk committees are established at the Group level, as well as within certain Everest entities, to oversee capital and risk positions, approve risk management strategies and limits and establish appropriate risk standards and policies.\nOur Enterprise Risk Committee (“ERC”) reports to and assists the Chief Executive Officer in the oversight and review of Everest’s ERM framework and key risks, including Underwriting, Financial, Operational and Strategic risks.  The ERC is responsible for establishing the Group’s risk management principles, policies and risk appetite levels.  The ERC meets at least quarterly and is comprised of the following senior executives:  Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Operating Officer, Reinsurance Chief Underwriting Officer, Insurance Chief Underwriting Officer, Chief Transformation, Innovation and Operations Leader, Chief Reserving Actuary and Chief Risk Officer.\nThe ERC is assisted in its activities by Everest’s ERM function and senior management risk committees.  The ERC provides strategic risk management direction to the Group, which is then executed by the business units and by Everest’s ERM function.  ERM is centrally responsible for implementing the risk management framework and identifying, assessing, \n13\nTable of Contents\nmonitoring, controlling and communicating the Company’s risk exposures.  Everest’s ERM function is independent of operating units and reports to the Chief Risk Officer.  Everest’s senior management risk committees, including the Underwriting Risk Committee, Financial Risk Committee and Operational Risk Committee, support ERM and the ERC with the compilation and analysis of risk insights with regards to exposure management and execution management. \nOur Chief Risk Officer also reports to the Board’s Risk Management Committee (“RMC”), which helps execute the Board’s supervisory responsibility pertaining to ERM.  The role of the RMC includes evaluation of the integrity and effectiveness of our ERM procedures, systems, and information; governance on major policy decisions pertaining to risk aggregation and minimization; and, assessment of our major decisions and preparedness levels pertaining to perceived material risks.\nRegulatory Matters.\nThe Company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance statutes of the various jurisdictions in which they conduct business, including all U.S. states, Canada, Singapore, Brazil, the U.K., Ireland, Chile Colombia, Mexico and Bermuda.  These regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are generally designed to protect ceding insurance companies and policyholders by regulating the Company’s conduct of business, financial integrity and ability to meet its obligations.  Many of these regulations require reporting of information designed to allow insurance regulators to closely monitor the Company’s performance.\nClimate-Related Risk Management.\nAs a global insurance and reinsurance organization, we recognize the potential impact of extreme natural perils on our world. We are also acutely aware of the fact that our industry plays a critical role in economic and social recovery after such extreme weather events. It is our policy to remain committed to providing solutions that can help our clients manage their own environmental risks in real and practical ways. We are also dedicated to managing and reducing our own ecological footprint wherever possible and considering environmental factors when making investment decisions.\nMuch of our business involves protecting clients through insurance and reinsurance from the impact of devastating natural catastrophes. As such, it is our policy to take a proactive approach to incorporating climate and weather-related risk into our underwriting procedure. To meet this challenge, our underwriting, actuarial and catastrophe modelling teams work together in researching and analyzing external raw climate/meteorological data in conjunction with our internal proprietary claims and loss information data to assess the geographical impacts of climate-related risk and develop predictive analytics models to refine our pricing tolerances and product development.\n \nThis team approach to assessing the impact of climate-related risk for Everest, as well as our customers, ensures that we are most accurately and responsibly providing specialized coverage to our clients for climate and other environment-related risks.\nInsurance Holding Company Regulation.\n  \nUnder applicable U.S. laws and regulations, no person, corporation or other entity may acquire a controlling interest in the Company, unless such person, corporation or entity has obtained prior approval for such acquisition from the insurance commissioners of Delaware and any other state in which the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled (as of this date, California).  Under these laws, “control” is presumed when any person acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company.  To obtain the approval of any change in control, the proposed acquirer must file an application with the relevant insurance commissioner disclosing, among other things, the background of the acquirer and that of its directors and officers, the acquirer’s financial condition and its proposed changes in the management and operations of the insurance company.  U.S. state regulators also require prior notice or regulatory approval of material intercompany and inter-affiliate transactions within the holding company structure.\nThe Insurance Companies Act of Canada requires prior approval by the Minister of Finance of anyone acquiring a significant interest in an insurance company authorized to do business in Canada.  In addition, the Company is subject to regulation by the insurance regulators of other U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business.  Certain of these U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions impose regulations regulating the ability of any person to acquire control of an insurance company authorized to do business in that jurisdiction without appropriate regulatory approval similar to those described above.\n14\nTable of Contents\nDividends.\n \n \nUnder Bermuda law, Group is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if such payment would reduce the realizable value of its assets to an amount less than the aggregate value of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium (additional paid-in capital) accounts.  Group’s ability to pay dividends and its operating expenses is partially dependent upon dividends from its subsidiaries.  The payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries is limited under Bermuda law as well as the laws of the various U.S. states in which Group’s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed domiciled.  The limitations are generally based upon net income (loss) and compliance with applicable policyholders’ surplus or minimum solvency and liquidity requirements as determined in accordance with the relevant statutory accounting practices.  Under Irish corporate and regulatory law, Holdings Ireland, Everest Dublin Insurance Holdings Limited (Ireland) (“Everest Dublin Holdings”) and their respective subsidiaries are limited as to the dividends they can pay based on retained earnings and net income (loss) and/or capital and minimum solvency requirements.  As Holdings has outstanding debt obligations, it is dependent upon dividends and other permissible payments from its operating subsidiaries to enable it to meet its debt and operating expense obligations and to pay dividends.\nUnder Bermuda law, Bermuda Re, Everest International and Everest Assurance are unable to declare or make payment of a dividend if they fail to meet their minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio.  As long-term insurers, Bermuda Re and Everest Assurance are also unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless, after payment of the dividend, the value of the assets in their long-term business fund, as certified by their approved actuary, exceeds their liabilities for long-term business by at least the $250,000 minimum solvency margin.  Prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the “BMA”) is required if Bermuda Re’s, Everest International’s or Everest Assurance’s dividend payments would exceed 25% of their respective prior year end statutory capital and surplus.  At December 31, 2024, Bermuda Re, Everest International and Everest Assurance exceeded their solvency and liquidity requirements.\nThe payment of dividends to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law.  Generally, Everest Re may only pay dividends out of its statutory earned surplus, which was $8.1 billion at December 31, 2024, and only after it has given 10 days prior notice to the Delaware Insurance Commissioner.  During this 10-day period, the Commissioner may, by order, limit or disallow the payment of ordinary dividends if the Commissioner finds the insurer to be presently or potentially in financial distress.  Further, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid without the prior approval of the Delaware Insurance Commissioner in any twelve-month period is the greater of (1) 10% of the insurer’s statutory surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year and (2) the insurer’s statutory net income (loss), not including realized capital gains (losses), for the prior calendar year.  Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024, the maximum amount that will be available for the payment of dividends by Everest Re without triggering the requirement for prior approval of regulatory authorities in connection with a dividend is $813 million.\nInsurance Regulation.\n  \nBermuda Re and Everest International are not admitted to do business in any jurisdiction in the United States.  These entities conduct their insurance business from their offices in Bermuda, and branch offices in the U.K. for Bermuda Re, and Singapore and Australia for Everest International.  Everest Assurance, by virtue of its one-time election under section 953(d) of the U.S. IRC to be a U.S. income tax paying “Controlled Foreign Corporation”, is admitted to do business in the United States and Bermuda.  In Bermuda, Bermuda Re, Everest International, Everest Assurance and Mt. Logan Re, Ltd. (“Mt. Logan Re”) are regulated by the Insurance Act 1978 (as amended) and related regulations (the “Act”).  The Act establishes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and subjects Bermuda Re, Everest International and Everest Assurance to the supervision, investigation and intervention powers of the BMA.  Under the Act, each of Bermuda Re and Everest International, as a Class 4 insurer, is required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda, maintain a minimum of $100 million in statutory capital and surplus, have an independent auditor approved by the BMA conduct an annual audit and report on their respective statutory and U.S. GAAP financial statements and filings, and have an appointed loss reserve specialist (also approved by the BMA) review and report on their respective loss reserves annually.  Under the Act, Everest Assurance is licensed as a Class 3A insurer for general business and as a Class C insurer for long-term business.\nBermuda Re is also registered under the Act as a long-term insurer and is thereby authorized to write life and annuity business.  As a long-term insurer, Bermuda Re is required to maintain $250,000 in statutory capital separate from its Class 4 minimum statutory capital and surplus, to maintain long-term business funds, to separately account for this business and to have an approved actuary prepare a certificate concerning its long-term business assets and liabilities to be filed annually.  Bermuda Re’s operations in the U.K. are subject to regulation by the Prudential Regulation Authority (the \n15\nTable of Contents\n“PRA”) and the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”).  The PRA imposes solvency, capital adequacy, audit, financial reporting and other regulatory requirements on insurers transacting business in the U.K.  The FCA regulates the conduct of insurers transacting business in the U.K.  Bermuda Re presently meets or exceeds all of the PRA’s solvency and capital requirements.\nU.S. domestic property and casualty insurers, including reinsurers, are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed.  The regulation of reinsurers is typically focused on financial condition, investments, management and operation.

In addition, non-U.S. insurance companies and branches are subject to examination and review by regulators in their respective jurisdictions.  In 2024, there were no reports of these examinations or reviews issued that contained any material findings or recommendations.\nNAIC Risk-Based Capital Requirements.\n  \nThe U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has developed a formula to measure the statutory minimum amount of capital required for a property and casualty insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile.  The major categories of a company’s risk profile are its asset risk, credit risk \n17\nTable of Contents\nand underwriting risk.  The standard is an effort to anticipate insolvencies.  This allows regulators to take actions that could limit the impact of these insolvencies on policyholders.\nUnder the approved formula, a company’s adjusted statutory surplus (end of period surplus adjusted for items not currently applicable to the Everest companies) is compared to the Risk-Based Capital Model (“RBC”) developed by the NAIC.  If this ratio is above a minimum threshold, no action is necessary.  Below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which an insurer’s domiciliary state regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of adjusted surplus to RBC decreases.  The mildest intervention requires an insurer to submit a plan of appropriate corrective actions.  The most severe action requires an insurer to be rehabilitated or liquidated.\nBased on their financial positions, as of December 31, 2024, Everest Re, Everest National, Everest Indemnity, Everest Security, Everest Denali and Everest Premier exceed the minimum RBC thresholds.\nTax Matters.\nThe following summary of the taxation of the Company is based on current law.  There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or administrative changes will not be enacted that might materially affect this summary.\nBermuda.\n  \nOn December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (“The 2023 Act”), which will apply a 15% corporate income tax to certain Bermuda businesses in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The 2023 Act includes a provision referred to as “The Economic Transition Adjustment” (the “ETA”), which is intended to provide a fair and equitable transition into the new tax regime, and results in a deferred tax benefit for the Company. However, on January 15, 2025, the OECD issued Guidance related to “deferred tax assets arising from tax benefits provided by General Government” whereby it has restricted the utilization of those deferred tax benefits against the computation of its Pillar Two Global Minimum Taxes to approximately 20% of the originally calculated amounts and only for a grace period of two years through 2026. If the Bermuda Ministry of Finance amends The 2023 Act in response to this Guidance, the exact impact of any such amendments is uncertain but there is a risk that it results in a reduction in the Company's Deferred Tax Assets.\nUnder current Bermuda law through 2024, no income, withholding or capital gains taxes are imposed upon Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries. Non-Bermuda branches of Bermuda subsidiaries are subject to local taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate.\nUnited States.\n  \nGroup’s U.S. subsidiaries conduct business and are subject to taxation in the United States. Non-U.S. branches of U.S. subsidiaries are subject to both local taxation in the jurisdictions in which they operate and U.S. corporate income tax but are generally relieved from double taxation through the application of foreign tax credits against their U.S. income tax liability. Should the U.S. subsidiaries distribute current or accumulated earnings and profits in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to withholding taxes. The cumulative amount that would be subject to U.S. withholding tax, if distributed, is not practicable to compute. Group and its Bermuda subsidiaries believe that they have operated and will continue to operate their businesses in a manner that will not cause them to generate income treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. On this basis, Group does not expect that it or its Bermuda subsidiaries will be required to pay U.S. corporate income taxes other than withholding taxes on certain investment income and premium excise taxes. If Group or its Bermuda subsidiaries were to become subject to U.S. income tax, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted. We have evaluated the tax provisions of the IRA, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax and the share repurchase excise tax, and do not expect the legislation to have a material impact on our results of operations. \n18\nTable of Contents\nOther Countries\n.\nThe Company does business in the following locations where it is subject to taxation by the local authorities:  Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, U.K., Singapore, Spain, and Switzerland. \nAvailable Information.\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports are available free of charge through the Company’s website at http://www.everestglobal.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).",
  "item7": "ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nOverview.\nEverest is a global underwriting leader providing best-in-class property, casualty and specialty reinsurance and insurance solutions. As part of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index, we are a leading financial services institution focused on value creation for our shareholders while diversifying our portfolio and geographic presence. Through our direct and indirect subsidiaries operating in the U.S. and internationally, we serve a diverse group of clients worldwide, providing what we believe are extensive product and distribution capabilities, a strong balance sheet, an innovative culture and access to world-class talent.  \nAs a global leader with a 50-year track record, we are a preferred Reinsurance partner in the markets we serve, and with\nour growing Insurance franchise we strive to deliver consistent value to all our stakeholders. We continue to grow and develop our Insurance business, investing in our global platform and strengthening our portfolio and its potential to deliver on our customer promise.\nDuring 2024, we formed a new “Other” segment, primarily comprised of the results of our sports and leisure business sold in October 2024, consisting of policies written prior to the sale and polices renewed and certain new business written on the Company’s paper post-sale. It also includes run-off asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) exposures, certain discontinued insurance programs primarily written prior to 2012 and certain discontinued insurance and reinsurance coverage classes.   The Other segment does not generally sell insurance or reinsurance products but is responsible for the management of existing policies and settlement of related losses.  These segment presentation changes have been reflected retrospectively. The Company will continue to have two reportable segments that actively sell products, Reinsurance and Insurance, consistent with how the on-going business is managed. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of segment results.\nOur current year net income of $1.4 billion is inclusive of unfavorable development of prior-year loss reserves of $1.5 billion. Following a comprehensive reserve review, we have significantly fortified our U.S. casualty reserves, while taking aggressive underwriting action in certain classes exposed to social inflation, bolstering talent and investing in our platform as we head into 2025. Refer to management’s discussion of consolidated and segment results below.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, under ITEM 8 of this Form 10-K.  Pursuant to the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, comparisons between 2023 and 2022 have been omitted from this Form 10-K but can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. \nAll comparisons in this discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise indicated. \n37\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Summary.\nWe monitor and evaluate our overall performance based upon financial results.

The increase in reinsurance premiums reflects growth across multiple lines of business, particularly property and casualty pro rata business and property catastrophe excess of loss business.  The increase in insurance \n38\nTable of Contents\npremiums reflects growth in property/short tail business and other specialty business, partially offset by portfolio actions taken on accident and health, workers’ compensation and specialty casualty lines of business.  \nNet written premiums increased by 7.4% to $15.8 billion in 2024, compared to $14.7 billion in 2023.  The current year over prior year increase remained relatively consistent with the percentage increase in gross written premiums.\nPremiums earned increased by 13.0% to $15.2 billion in 2024, compared to $13.4 billion in 2023, which is consistent with the percentage changes in gross written premiums.  The change in premiums earned relative to net written premiums was primarily the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period \nwhereas written premiums are generally recorded at the initiation of the coverage period.    \nOther Income (Expense).\n  We recorded other income of $121 million and other expense of $14 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The change was primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, gain from the sale of the sports and leisure business and gain from pension plan curtailment.  We recognized foreign currency exchange income of $58 million in 2024 and foreign currency exchange expense of $24 million in 2023.  Additionally, we recognized a $40 million gain on sale of our sports and leisure business, including renewal rights, sold during the fourth quarter and a $9 million pension plan curtailment gain. \nClaims and Expenses.\nIncurred Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses (“LAE”).\n  The following table presents our incurred losses and LAE for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\nCurrent\nYear\nRatio %/\nPt Change\nPrior\nYears\nRatio %/\nPt Change\nTotal\nIncurred\nRatio %/\nPt Change\n2024\nAttritional\n$\n9,074 \n59.8 \n%\n$\n1,475 \n9.7 \n%\n$\n10,550 \n69.5 \n%\nCatastrophes\n893 \n5.9 \n%\n(138)\n(0.9)\n%\n755 \n5.0 \n%\nTotal segment\n$\n9,967 \n65.6 \n%\n$\n1,337 \n8.8 \n%\n$\n11,305 \n74.4 \n%\n2023\nAttritional\n$\n7,963 \n59.2 \n%\n$\n(5)\n— \n%\n$\n7,958 \n59.2 \n%\nCatastrophes\n470 \n3.5 \n%\n— \n— \n%\n470 \n3.5 \n%\nTotal segment\n$\n8,432 \n62.7 \n%\n$\n(5)\n— \n%\n$\n8,427 \n62.7 \n%\n2022\nAttritional\n$\n7,047 \n59.8 \n%\n$\n(2)\n— \n%\n$\n7,045 \n59.8 \n%\nCatastrophes\n1,055 \n9.0 \n%\n— \n— \n%\n1,055 \n9.0 \n%\nTotal segment\n$\n8,102 \n68.8 \n%\n$\n(2)\n— \n%\n$\n8,100 \n68.7 \n%\nVariance 2024/2023\nAttritional\n$\n1,112 \n0.5 \n pts\n$\n1,481 \n9.8 \n pts\n$\n2,592 \n10.3 \n pts\nCatastrophes\n423 \n2.4 \n pts\n(138)\n(0.9)\n pts\n285 \n1.5 \n pts\nTotal segment\n$\n1,535 \n2.9 \n pts\n$\n1,342 \n8.8 \n pts\n$\n2,877 \n11.7 \n pts\nVariance 2023/2022\nAttritional\n$\n916 \n(0.5)\n pts\n$\n(3)\n— \n pts\n$\n912 \n(0.6)\n pts\nCatastrophes\n(585)\n(5.5)\n pts\n— \n— \n pts\n(585)\n(5.5)\n pts\nTotal segment\n$\n331 \n(6.0)\n pts\n$\n(3)\n— \n pts\n$\n327 \n(6.0)\n pts\n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\nIncurred losses and LAE increased by 34.1% to $11.3 billion in 2024, compared to $8.4 billion in 2023, primarily due to an increase of $1.1 billion in current year attritional losses, an increase of $423 million in current year catastrophe losses and  unfavorable development on prior year attritional losses of $1.5 billion, partially offset by favorable development on prior year catastrophe losses of $138 million.  \nThe increase in current year attritional losses was mainly due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned, changes in the mix of business and strengthening of current accident year U.S. casualty reserves by $206 million in the Insurance \n39\nTable of Contents\nsegment.  The current year catastrophe losses of $893 million in 2024 related primarily to Hurricane Milton ($320 million), Hurricane Helene ($94 million), Hurricane Beryl ($64 million), Hurricane Debby ($56 million), the 2024 European flood Boris ($56 million), the 2024 Baltimore bridge collapse ($55 million), the third quarter 2024 Calgary Alberta storms ($54 million), the 2024 Brazil Floods ($41 million), the 2024 Dubai floods ($32 million), the 2024 Germany floods ($31 million), the 2024 New Caledonia Riots ($31 million) and the 2024 Taiwan earthquake ($27 million), with the remaining losses resulting from various events.  The $470 million of current year catastrophe losses in 2023 related primarily to the 2023 Turkey earthquakes ($103 million), Hurricane Otis ($100 million), the 2023 Italy convective storm ($57 million), the 2023 New Zealand storms ($45 million), the 2023 Morocco earthquake ($40 million), the 2023 Hawaii wildfire ($32 million) and Hurricane Idalia ($23 million), with the remaining losses resulting from various storm events.\nUnfavorable development on prior year attritional losses was $1.5 billion in 2024 compared to favorable development of $5 million in 2023. The net unfavorable development on prior year attritional reserves of $1.5 billion in 2024 is  comprised of $1.1 billion of unfavorable development on prior years attritional losses from the Insurance segment, mainly driven by a combination of social inflation and portfolio concentrations in certain U.S. casualty lines and $403 million of unfavorable development on prior years attritional losses from the Other segment, mainly related to certain sports and leisure lines for accident years 2019 through 2023, including A&E reserve strengthening of $54 million. In addition, the Reinsurance segment recorded $684 million of unfavorable development on prior year casualty reserves. This unfavorable development in the Reinsurance segment was largely offset by favorable development booked on well-seasoned reserves in the property and mortgage lines. \nCatastrophe losses and loss expenses typically have a material effect on our incurred losses and LAE results and can vary significantly from period to period.  Losses from natural catastrophes contributed 5.9 percentage points to the combined ratio in 2024, compared with 3.5 percentage points in 2023.\nRefer to the “Ratios” section for loss ratio analysis discussion.\nCommission, Brokerage, Taxes and Fees.\n  Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees increased by 11.8% to $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.  The increase was primarily due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned and changes in the mix of business.  Refer to the “Ratios” section for commission and brokerage ratio analysis discussion.\nOther Underwriting Expenses.\n  Other underwriting expenses were $938 million and $846 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The increase in other underwriting expenses was mainly due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned as well as the continued build out of our insurance operations, including an expansion of the international insurance platform.  Refer to the “Ratios” section for other underwriting expense ratio analysis discussion.\nCorporate Expenses.\n  Corporate expenses, which are general operating expenses that are not allocated to segments, were $95 million and $73 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The increase in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to information management related costs, including the acceleration of cybersecurity, corporate applications and infrastructure investments as well as an increase in compensation costs due to increased headcount from the prior year. \nInterest, Fees and Bond Issue Cost Amortization Expense.\n  Interest, fees and other bond amortization expense was $149 million and $134 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The increase was primarily driven by higher interest costs resulting from additional borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”), offset by the change in the floating interest rate related to the Company’s outstanding fixed to floating rate long-term subordinated notes, which is reset quarterly per the note agreement.  The floating rate was 7.17% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 8.03% as of December 31, 2023.  \nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit).\n  Everest had an income tax expense of $120 million and income tax benefit of $363 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. An income tax expense/benefit is primarily a function of the geographic location of the Company’s pre-tax income and the statutory tax rates in those jurisdictions. The effective tax rate (“ETR”) is primarily affected by tax-exempt investment income, foreign tax credits and dividends. Variations in the ETR generally result from changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income, including the impact of catastrophe losses and net capital gains (losses), among jurisdictions with different tax rates. The tax benefit in 2023 was primarily due to the implementation of the provisions of the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023 (“The 2023 Act”).\n40\nTable of Contents\nOn December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (“The 2023 Act”), which will apply a 15% corporate income tax to certain Bermuda businesses in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The 2023 Act includes a provision referred to as “The Economic Transition Adjustment” (the “ETA”), which is intended to provide a fair and equitable transition into the new tax regime, and results in a deferred tax benefit for the Company. However, on January 15, 2025, the OECD issued Guidance related to “deferred tax assets arising from tax benefits provided by General Government” whereby it has restricted the utilization of those deferred tax benefits against the computation of its Pillar Two Global Minimum Taxes to approximately 20% of the originally calculated amounts and only for a grace period of two years through 2026. If the Bermuda Ministry of Finance amends The 2023 Act in response to this Guidance, the exact impact of any such amendments is uncertain but there is a risk that it results in a reduction in the Company's Deferred Tax Assets.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted. We have evaluated the tax provisions of the IRA, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax and the share repurchase excise tax, and do not expect the legislation to have a material impact on our results of operations. \nNet Income (Loss).\nOur net income was $1.4 billion and $2.5 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectiv\nely.  The decline was primarily driven by a decrease in underwriting income of $1.6 billion resulting from the unfavorable prior year development recognized in 2024, partially offset by an increase of $520 million in net investment income.\nRatios.\nOur combined ratio increased by 11.4 points to 102.3% in 2024, compared to 90.9% in 2023. The current year increase is primarily due to prior year development on attritional losses and higher current year catastrophe losses.  \nThe loss ratio component increased by 11.7 points in 2024 over the same period last year mainly due to an increase of $423 million in catastrophe losses and prior year development on attritional losses.  \nThe commission and brokerage ratio components decreased to 21.7% in 2024, compared to 22.0% in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to changes in the mix of business. \nThe other underwriting expense ratio decreased to 6.2% in 2024, compared to 6.3% in 2023.  The decrease was mainly due to Reinsurance segment continued leverage against its premium base, offset by Insurance segment expenses driven by continued international growth.  \nShareholders’ Equity.\nShareholders’ equity increased by $673 million to $13.9 billion at December 31, 2024 from $13.2 billion at December 31, 2023, principally as a result of $1.4 billion of net income, partially offset by $334 million of shareholder dividends, $200 million of share repurchases, $128 million of net foreign currency translation adjustments and $127 million of unrealized depreciation on fixed income available for sale securities, net of tax.\nConsolidated Investment Results\nNet Investment Income.\nNet investment income increased by 36.3% to $2.0 billion in 2024, compared with net investment income of $1.4 billion in 2023.  The increase was primarily the result of an additional $382 million of income from fixed maturity and short-term investments, an increase of $84 million in income from limited partnerships and an increase of $45 million in income from other alternative investments.  The limited partnership income primarily reflects changes in their reported net asset values.  As such, until these asset values are monetized and the resultant income is distributed, they are subject to volatile results of future increases or decreases in the asset value.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the components of net investment income for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFixed maturities\n$\n1,481 \n$\n1,153 \n$\n742 \nEquity securities\n3 \n3 \n16 \nShort-term investments and cash\n195 \n140 \n28 \nOther invested assets\nLimited partnerships\n206 \n122 \n75 \nOther\n104 \n59 \n29 \nGross investment income before adjustments\n1,989 \n1,477 \n890 \nFunds held interest income (expense)\n26 \n10 \n2 \nFuture policy benefit reserve income (expense)\n(1)\n(1)\n— \nGross investment income\n2,013 \n1,486 \n892 \nInvestment expenses\n59 \n53 \n62 \nNet investment income\n$\n1,954 \n$\n1,434 \n$\n830 \n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\nThe following tables show a comparison of various investment yields for the periods indicated:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAnnualized pre-tax yield on average cash and invested assets\n4.9 \n%\n4.1 \n%\n2.7 \n%\nAnnualized after-tax yield on average cash and invested assets\n4.2 \n%\n3.6 \n%\n2.3 \n%\nAnnualized return on invested assets\n4.9 \n%\n3.3 \n%\n1.2 \n%\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFixed income portfolio total return\n4.0 \n%\n6.8 \n%\n(5.9)\n%\nBloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index\n1.3 \n%\n5.5 \n%\n(13.0)\n%\nCommon equity portfolio total return\n10.9 \n%\n17.6 \n%\n(18.5)\n%\nS&P 500 index\n25.0 \n%\n26.3 \n%\n(18.1)\n%\nOther invested asset portfolio total return\n6.5 \n%\n4.3 \n%\n4.5 \n%\nThe pre-tax equivalent total return for the bond portfolio was approximately 4.0% and 6.8%, respectively, in 2024 and 2023.

Of the total fixed maturities, 96.4% were investment grade. Additionally, the average maturity of fixed maturity securities was 4.9 years at December 31, 2024, and their overall average duration was 3.1 years.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have any direct investments in commercial real estate, direct commercial mortgages or securities of issuers that are experiencing cash flow difficulty to an extent that the Company’s management believes that the issuer’s ability to meet debt service payments, except where an allowance for credit losses has been recognized, is threatened.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio includes structured commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) with a book value of $985 million and a fair value of $921 million.  As of December 31, 2024, 85.2% of CMBS securities in our investment portfolio are rated AAA by nationally recognized rating agencies.  The remainder of CMBS securities in our investment portfolio are rated investment grade by nationally recognized rating agencies.  \n42\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents the credit quality distribution of the Company’s fixed maturities for the periods indicated:  \nAt December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(Dollars in millions)\nFair Value/\nAmortized Cost \n(1)\nPercent of\nTotal\nFair Value/\nAmortized Cost \n(1)\nPercent of\nTotal\nRating Agency Credit Quality Distribution:\nAAA\n$\n6,934 \n23.4 \n%\n$\n7,011 \n24.5 \n%\nAA\n8,971 \n30.2 \n%\n8,629 \n30.2 \n%\nA\n8,216 \n27.7 \n%\n7,297 \n25.5 \n%\nBBB\n4,464 \n15.0 \n%\n4,168 \n14.6 \n%\nBB\n738 \n2.5 \n%\n1,067 \n3.7 \n%\nB\n103 \n0.3 \n%\n132 \n0.5 \n%\nRated below B\n32 \n0.1 \n%\n51 \n0.2 \n%\nOther\n206 \n0.7 \n%\n240 \n0.8 \n%\nTotal\n$\n29,665 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n28,595 \n100.0 \n%\n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\n(1)\nFixed maturities-available for sale are at fair value and fixed maturities-held to maturity are at amortized cost, net of allowances for credit losses.\nThe following table summarizes fixed maturities by contractual maturity for the periods indicated:  \nAt December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(Dollars in millions)\nFair Value/\nAmortized Cost \n(1) (2)\nPercent of\nTotal\nFair Value/\nAmortized Cost \n(1) (2)\nPercent of\nTotal\nFixed maturity securities\nDue in one year or less\n$\n1,087 \n3.7 \n%\n$\n1,266 \n4.4 \n%\nDue after one year through five years\n8,546 \n28.8 \n%\n6,916 \n24.2 \n%\nDue after five years through ten years\n4,560 \n15.4 \n%\n5,448 \n19.1 \n%\nDue after ten years\n1,871 \n6.3 \n%\n2,585 \n9.0 \n%\nAsset-backed securities\n6,462 \n21.8 \n%\n6,221 \n21.8 \n%\nMortgage-backed securities\n7,141 \n24.1 \n%\n6,159 \n21.5 \n%\nTotal fixed maturity securities\n$\n29,665 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n28,595 \n100.0 \n%\n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\n(1)\n Fixed maturities-available for sale are at fair value and fixed maturities-held to maturity are at amortized cost, net of allowances for credit losses.\n(2) \nThe amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity securities are shown by contractual maturity.

The realized gains from dispositions of investments mainly related to the execution of a Company strategy to sell lower yielding investments in order to reinvest the proceeds at higher interest rates.\nSegment Results.\nOur two reportable segments, Reinsurance and Insurance, each have executive leadership who are responsible for the overall performance of their respective segments and who are directly accountable to our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), the Chief Executive Officer of Everest Group, Ltd., who is ultimately responsible for reviewing the business to assess performance, make operating decisions and allocate resources. We report the results of our operations consistent with the manner in which our CODM reviews the business.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company revised its classification and presentation of certain run-off business, previously included within the Reinsurance and Insurance reportable segments, as part of a new segment called \"Other\".  The new Other segment includes the results of our sports and leisure business sold in October 2024, consisting of policies written prior to the sale and polices renewed and certain new business written on the Company’s paper post-sale. It also \n44\nTable of Contents\nincludes run-off A&E exposures, certain discontinued insurance programs primarily written prior to 2012 and certain discontinued insurance and reinsurance coverage classes.   The Other segment does not generally sell insurance or reinsurance products but is responsible for the management of existing policies and settlement of related losses.  Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company revised the classification and presentation of certain products related to its accident and health business within the reportable segment groupings. These products have been realigned from within the Reinsurance segment to the Insurance segment to appropriately reflect how the business segments are managed due to changes in management implemented during the fourth quarter of 2023.  These segment presentation changes have been reflected retrospectively. The Company will continue to have two reportable segments that actively sell products, Reinsurance and Insurance, consistent with how the on-going business is managed.\nThe Company does not review and evaluate the financial results of its segments based upon balance sheet data.  Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these segments based upon their underwriting results.  Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses.  The Company measures its underwriting results using ratios, in particular, loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which, respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by premiums earned.  Management has determined that these measures are appropriate and align with how the business is managed. We continue to evaluate our segments as our business evolves and may further refine our segments and financial performance measures.\nThe following discusses the underwriting results for each of our segments for the periods indicated.\nReinsurance.\nThe following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the Reinsurance segment for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024/2023\n2023/2022\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nVariance\n% Change\nVariance\n% Change\nGross written premiums\n$\n12,941 \n$\n11,460 \n$\n9,246 \n$\n1,481 \n12.9 \n%\n$\n2,214 \n23.9 \n%\nNet written premiums\n11,969 \n10,802 \n8,917 \n1,167 \n10.8 \n%\n1,884 \n21.1 \n%\nPremiums earned\n$\n11,412 \n$\n9,799 \n$\n8,596 \n$\n1,613 \n16.5 \n%\n$\n1,203 \n14.0 \n%\nIncurred losses and LAE\n7,103 \n5,690 \n5,962 \n1,413 \n24.8 \n%\n(272)\n(4.6)\n%\nCommission and brokerage\n2,837 \n2,520 \n2,116 \n317 \n12.6 \n%\n404 \n19.1 \n%\nOther underwriting expenses\n290 \n254 \n216 \n36 \n14.1 \n%\n38 \n17.6 \n%\nUnderwriting gain (loss)\n$\n1,181 \n$\n1,334 \n$\n302 \n$\n(153)\n(11.5)\n%\n$\n1,032 \nNM\nPoint Chg\nPoint Chg\nLoss ratio\n62.2 \n%\n58.1 \n%\n69.4 \n%\n4.2 \n(11.3)\nCommission and brokerage ratio\n24.9 \n%\n25.7 \n%\n24.6 \n%\n(0.8)\n1.1 \nOther underwriting expense ratio\n2.5 \n%\n2.6 \n%\n2.5 \n%\n(0.1)\n0.1 \nCombined ratio\n89.7 \n%\n86.4 \n%\n96.5 \n%\n3.3 \n(10.1)\n(NM, not meaningful)\n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\nPremiums.\n  Gross written premiums increased by 12.9% to $12.9 billion in 2024 from $11.5 billion in 2023.  The increase in gross written premiums reflects growth across multiple lines of business, particularly property and casualty pro rata business and property catastrophe excess of loss business.\nNet written premiums increased by 10.8% to $12.0 billion in 2024, compared to $10.8 billion in 2023.  The current year over prior year increase remained relatively consistent with the percentage increase in gross written premiums.\nPremiums earned increased by 16.5% to $11.4 billion in 2024, compared to $9.8 billion in 2023.  The change in premiums earned relative to net written premiums is primarily the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period whereas written premiums are generally recorded at the initiation of the coverage period.\nDuring 2023, the Company refined its premium estimation methodology for its risk attaching reinsurance contracts within its Reinsurance segment to continue to recognize gross written premium over the term of the treaty, albeit over a different pattern than what was previously used. The refined estimate resulted in an increase of gross written premium for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, and has further aligned the estimation methodology across the \n45\nTable of Contents\nreinsurance division globally. This change had no impact on the total written premium to be recognized over the term of the treaties.  There was no impact on net earned premium and therefore, no impact on income from continuing operations, net income or any related per-share amounts. \nIncurred Losses and LAE.\n \nThe following table presents the incurred losses and LAE for the Reinsurance segment for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\nCurrent\nYear\nRatio %/\nPt Change\nPrior\nYears\nRatio %/\nPt Change\nTotal\nIncurred\nRatio %/\nPt Change\n2024\nAttritional\n$\n6,456 \n56.6 \n%\n$\n— \n— \n%\n6,456 \n56.6 \n%\nCatastrophes\n772 \n6.8 \n%\n(125)\n(1.1)\n%\n647 \n5.7 \n%\nTotal segment\n$\n7,228 \n63.3 \n%\n$\n(125)\n(1.1)\n%\n$\n7,103 \n62.2 \n%\n2023\nAttritional\n$\n5,641 \n57.6 \n%\n$\n(401)\n(4.1)\n%\n$\n5,241 \n53.5 \n%\nCatastrophes\n449 \n4.6 \n%\n— \n— \n%\n449 \n4.6 \n%\nTotal segment\n$\n6,091 \n62.2 \n%\n$\n(401)\n(4.1)\n%\n$\n5,690 \n58.1 \n%\n2022\nAttritional\n$\n5,166 \n60.1 \n%\n$\n(135)\n(1.6)\n%\n$\n5,032 \n58.5 \n%\nCatastrophes\n930 \n10.8 \n%\n— \n— \n%\n930 \n10.8 \n%\nTotal segment\n$\n6,096 \n70.9 \n%\n$\n(135)\n(1.6)\n%\n$\n5,962 \n69.4 \n%\nVariance 2024/2023\nAttritional\n$\n815 \n(1.0)\n pts\n$\n401 \n4.1 \n pts\n$\n1,216 \n3.1 \n pts\nCatastrophes\n322 \n2.2 \n pts\n(125)\n(1.1)\n pts\n197 \n1.1 \n pts\nTotal segment\n$\n1,137 \n1.2 \n pts\n$\n276 \n3.0 \n pts\n$\n1,413 \n4.2 \n pts\nVariance 2023/2022\nAttritional\n$\n475 \n(2.5)\n pts\n$\n(266)\n(2.5)\n pts\n$\n209 \n(5.0)\n pts\nCatastrophes\n(481)\n(6.2)\n pts\n— \n— \n pts\n(481)\n(6.2)\n pts\nTotal segment\n$\n(5)\n(8.8)\n pts\n$\n(266)\n(2.5)\n pts\n$\n(272)\n(11.3)\n pts\n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\nIncurred losses increased by 24.8% to $7.1 billion in 2024, compared to $5.7 billion in 2023.  The increase was primarily due to an increase of $815 million in current year attritional losses, an increase of $322 million in current year catastrophe losses and a decrease of favorable development on prior year attritional reserves ($0 million in 2024 and $401 million in 2023), partially offset by favorable development on prior year catastrophe losses of $125 million.  The increase in current year attritional losses was mainly related to the impact of the increase in premiums earned.  During the current year,  prior year U.S. casualty reserves were strengthened by $684 million. This reserve strengthening was fully offset by favorable development on well-seasoned reserves in property and mortgage lines. \nThe current year catastrophe losses of $772 million in 2024 related primarily to Hurricane Milton ($275 million), Hurricane Helene ($64 million), Hurricane Debby ($55 million), Hurricane Beryl ($54 million), the 2024 European flood Boris ($50 million), the 2024 Baltimore bridge collapse ($50 million), the third quarter 2024 Calgary Alberta storms ($45 million) and the 2024 Brazil Floods ($41 million), the 2024 Dubai floods ($32 million), the 2024 New Caledonia Riots ($31 million), the 2024 Germany floods ($28 million) and the 2024 Taiwan earthquake ($25 million), with the remaining losses resulting from various events.  The $449 million of current year catastrophe losses in 2023 related primarily to the 2023 Turkey earthquakes ($103 million), Hurricane Otis ($100 million), the 2023 Italy convective storm ($57 million), the 2023 New Zealand storms ($43 million), the 2023 Morocco earthquake ($40 million), the 2023 Hawaii wildfire ($27 million) and Hurricane Idalia ($23 million), with the remaining losses resulting from various storm events.\nSegment Expenses.\n  Commission and brokerage expense increased by 12.6% to $2.8 billion in 2024, compared to $2.5 billion in 2023.  The increase was mainly due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned and changes in the mix of business.  Segment other underwriting expenses increased to $290 million in 2024 from $254 million in 2023.  The increase was in line with growth in the business and necessary support functions.\n46\nTable of Contents\nInsurance.\nThe following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the Insurance segment for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024/2023\n2023/2022\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nVariance\n% Change\nVariance\n% Change\nGross written premiums\n$\n5,078 \n$\n4,888 \n$\n4,426 \n$\n191 \n3.9 \n%\n$\n462 \n10.4 \n%\nNet written premiums\n3,678 \n3,704 \n3,223 \n(26)\n(0.7)\n%\n481 \n14.9 \n%\nPremiums earned\n$\n3,579 \n$\n3,420 \n$\n2,998 \n$\n159 \n4.6 \n%\n$\n422 \n14.1 \n%\nIncurred losses and LAE\n3,622 \n2,471 \n2,040 \n1,150 \n46.5 \n%\n431 \n21.1 \n%\nCommission and brokerage\n439 \n410 \n399 \n29 \n7.0 \n%\n11 \n2.7 \n%\nOther underwriting expenses\n615 \n556 \n438 \n59 \n10.6 \n%\n119 \n27.1 \n%\nUnderwriting gain (loss)\n$\n(1,097)\n$\n(18)\n$\n121 \n$\n(1,079)\nNM\n$\n(139)\nNM\nPoint Chg\nPoint Chg\nLoss ratio\n101.2 \n%\n72.3 \n%\n68.1 \n%\n28.9 \n4.2 \nCommission and brokerage ratio\n12.3 \n%\n12.0 \n%\n13.3 \n%\n0.3 \n(1.3)\nOther underwriting expense ratio\n17.2 \n%\n16.3 \n%\n14.6 \n%\n0.9 \n1.7 \nCombined ratio\n130.7 \n%\n100.5 \n%\n96.0 \n%\n30.1 \n4.6 \n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\nPremiums.\n  Gross written premiums increased by 3.9% to $5.1 billion in 2024, compared to $4.9 billion in 2023.

The decrease in net written premiums compared to the increase in gross written premiums was mainly due to lower net retention resulting from changes in the mix of business. \nPremiums earned increased by 4.6% to $3.6 billion in 2024, compared to $3.4 billion in 2023.

The increase was mainly due to unfavorable development on prior years attritional losses of $787 million, an increase of $277 million in current year attritional losses and an increase in current year catastrophe losses of $100 million, partially offset by favorable development on prior years catastrophe losses of $14 million.  During 2024, prior year U.S. casualty reserves were strengthened by $1.1 billion. The reserve strengthening was driven by a combination of social inflation and portfolio concentrations in certain U.S. casualty lines classes.  The increase in current year attritional losses was primarily due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned and strengthening of current accident year U.S. casualty reserves by $206 million.  \nThe current year catastrophe losses of $120 million primarily related to Hurricane Milton ($44 million), Hurricane Helene ($29 million), Hurricane Beryl ($10 million) and the third quarter 2024 Calgary Alberta storms ($9 million), with the remaining losses resulting from various events.  The $20 million of current year catastrophe losses in 2023 primarily related to the 2023 third quarter U.S. storms ($5 million), the 2023 Hawaii wildfire ($5 million) and the 2023 December U.S. East Coast flooding ($5 million), with the remaining losses resulting from various storm events.\nSegment Expenses.\n  Commission and brokerage increased by 7.0% to $439 million in 2024, compared to $410 million in 2023.  Segment other underwriting expenses increased to $615 million in 2024, compared to $556 million in 2023.  These increases were mainly due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned and increased expenses related to the continued build out of the insurance business, including an expansion of the international insurance platform.\nOther.\nThe Other segment includes the results of our sports and leisure business sold in October 2024, consisting of policies written prior to the sale and polices renewed and certain new business written on the Company’s paper post-sale.

The Other segment does not generally sell insurance or reinsurance products but is responsible for the management of existing policies and settlement of related losses.  \nThe following table presents the underwriting results and ratios for the Other segment for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nGross written premiums\n$\n212 \n$\n289 \n$\n279 \nNet written premiums\n167 \n225 \n204 \nPremiums earned\n$\n197 \n$\n225 \n$\n194 \nIncurred losses and LAE\n580 \n266 \n98 \nCommission and brokerage\n24 \n22 \n14 \nOther underwriting expenses\n33 \n35 \n28 \nUnderwriting gain (loss)\n$\n(440)\n$\n(98)\n$\n54 \n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\nPremiums.\n  Gross written premiums decreased from $289 million in 2023 to $212 million in 2024.  Net written premiums decreased from $225 million in 2023 to $167 million in 2024.  Gross written premium is primarily coming from the sports and leisure business.  Premiums earned decreased from $225 million in 2023 to $197 million in 2024.  The decreases in gross written premiums, net written premiums and premiums earned are due to the lines of business included in this segment primarily being in run-off, except for a limited number of renewed and new policies written on the Company's paper by the purchaser of the sports and leisure business sold in October 2024, for a finite period of time post-closing.\nIncurred Losses and LAE.\n Incurred losses and LAE increased to $580 million in 2024, compared to $266 million in 2023.  The increase was mainly due to unfavorable development on prior years attritional losses of $293 million. During 2024, the unfavorable development on prior year attritional losses for the Company’s Other segment of $403 million was mainly related to North America casualty lines for accident years 2019 through 2023 that were impacted by social inflation, including A&E reserve strengthening of $54 million resulting in a 3-year net asbestos survival ratio of 7 years. \nSegment Expenses.\n  Commission and brokerage and other underwriting expenses remained relatively flat year over year. \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe following is a summary of the critical accounting estimates related to accounting estimates that (1) require management to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2) could materially impact the consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions.\nLoss and LAE Reserves.\n  Our most critical accounting estimate is the determination of our loss and LAE reserves.  We maintain reserves equal to management’s estimated ultimate liability for losses and LAE for reported and unreported claims for our insurance and reinsurance businesses.  Because reserves are based on estimates of ultimate losses and LAE by underwriting or accident year, we use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to monitor reserve adequacy over time, evaluate new information as it becomes known and adjust reserves whenever an adjustment appears warranted.  We consider many factors when setting reserves including:  (1) our exposure base and projected ultimate premiums earned; (2) our expected loss ratios by product and class of business, which are developed collaboratively by underwriters and actuaries; (3) actuarial methodologies and assumptions which analyze our loss reporting and payment experience, reports from ceding companies and historical trends, such as reserving patterns, loss payments and product mix; (4) current legal interpretations of coverage and liability; and (5) economic conditions.  Management’s best estimate is developed through collaboration with actuarial, underwriting, claims, legal and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees. Each segment reserve committee includes the participation of the relevant parties from actuarial, finance, claims and segment senior management.  Reserves are further reviewed by Everest’s Chief Reserving Actuary and senior management.  The objective of such process is to determine a single best estimate viewed by management to be the best estimate of its ultimate loss liability.   Our insurance and reinsurance loss and LAE reserves represent management’s best estimate of our ultimate liability. Actual losses and LAE ultimately paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from such reserves.  Net income (loss) will be impacted in a period in which the change in estimated ultimate losses and LAE is recorded.  See also ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n49\nTable of Contents\nIt is more difficult to accurately estimate loss reserves for reinsurance liabilities than for insurance liabilities.  At December 31, 2024, we had reinsurance loss reserves of $19.7 billion, insurance loss reserves of $8.8 billion and other loss reserves of $1.3 billion, of which $260 million were loss reserves for A&E liabilities. A detailed discussion of additional considerations related to A&E exposures follows later in this section.\nThe detailed data required to evaluate ultimate losses for our insurance business is accumulated from our underwriting and claim systems.  Reserving for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from ceding companies.  Ceding companies report losses to us in many ways depending on the type of contract and the agreed or contractual reporting requirements. Generally, proportional/quota share contracts require the submission of a monthly/quarterly account, which includes premium and loss activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company. This information is recorded into our records. For certain proportional contracts, we may require a detailed loss report for claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular type of loss.  Excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss reporting with precautionary notices provided when a loss reaches a significant percentage of the attachment point of the contract or when certain causes of loss or types of injury occur.  Our experienced Claims staff handles individual loss reports and supporting claim information.  Based on our evaluation of a claim, we may establish additional case reserves in addition to the case reserves reported by the ceding company. To ensure ceding companies are submitting required and accurate data, the Underwriting, Claim, Reinsurance Accounting and Internal Audit departments of the Company perform various reviews of our ceding companies, particularly larger ceding companies, including on-site audits of domestic ceding companies.\nWe sort our reserves by segment into exposure groupings for actuarial analysis.  We assign our business to exposure groupings so that the underlying exposures have reasonably homogeneous loss development characteristics and are large enough to facilitate credible estimation of ultimate losses.  We periodically review our exposure groupings, and we may change our groupings over time as our business changes.  We currently use approximately 250 exposure groupings to develop our reserve estimates.  One of the key selection characteristics for the exposure groupings is the historical duration of the claims settlement process.  Business in which claims are reported and settled relatively quickly are commonly referred to as short tail lines, principally property lines.  Casualty claims tend to take longer to be reported and settled and casualty lines are generally referred to as long tail lines.  Our estimates of ultimate losses for shorter tail lines, with the exception of loss estimates for large catastrophic events, generally exhibit less uncertainty than those for the longer tail lines.\nWe use a variety of actuarial methodologies, such as expected loss ratio, chain ladder reserving methods and Bornhuetter-Ferguson, supplemented by judgment where appropriate, to estimate our ultimate losses and LAE for each exposure group. Although we use similar actuarial methodologies for both short tail and long tail lines, the faster reporting of experience for the short tail lines allows us to have greater confidence in our estimates of ultimate losses at an earlier stage than for long tail lines.  For immature underwriting or accident years, the initial expected loss ratios are key inputs that involve management judgment and are based on a variety of factors, including: (1) expected loss ratios developed during our pricing process; (2) historical loss ratios adjusted for rate change and trend; and (3) industry benchmarks for similar business. These judgments take into account our view of past, current and future factors that may influence ultimate losses, including: (1) market conditions; (2) changes in the business underwritten; (3) changes in timing of the emergence of claims; and (4) other factors. The determination of when reported losses are sufficient and credible to warrant selection of an ultimate loss ratio different from the initial expected loss ratio also requires judgment.\nOur carried reserves at each reporting date are management’s best estimate of ultimate unpaid losses and LAE at that date.  We complete detailed reserve studies for each exposure group annually for our reinsurance and insurance operations.  The completed annual reserve studies are “rolled forward” for each accounting period until the subsequent reserve study is completed.  Analyzing the roll-forward process involves comparing actual reported losses to expected losses based on the most recent reserve study.  The Company analyzes significant variances between actual and expected losses and also considers recent market, underwriting and management criteria to determine management’s best estimate of ultimate unpaid losses and LAE.  \nCertain reserves, including losses from widespread catastrophic events and COVID-19 related losses, cannot be estimated using traditional actuarial method.  Rather, loss and LAE reserves are estimated by completing an in-depth analysis of the individual contracts which may potentially be impacted by the loss. The analysis uses inputs from various sources and methodology, to build up a comprehensive perspective.  Such analysis generally involves: 1) estimating the size of insured industry losses; 2) reviewing portfolios to identify contracts which are exposed; 3) reviewing information reported or otherwise provided by customers and brokers; 4) discussing the loss with customers and brokers; and 5) estimating the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims and administrative costs arising from the loss on a contract-by-contract basis \n50\nTable of Contents\nand in aggregate for the event. Due to the inherent uniqueness or specific nature of a catastrophic event, each event has its own unique assessment, and different weights may be applied to various inputs based on our judgment.  Once a loss has occurred, during the then current reporting period, we record our best estimate of the ultimate expected cost to settle all claims arising from the loss. Our estimate of loss and LAE reserves is then determined by deducting cumulative paid losses from its estimate of the ultimate expected loss. Our estimate of incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) is determined by deducting cumulative paid losses, case reserves and additional case reserves from its estimate of the ultimate expected loss.  \nBecause catastrophe losses are typically due to prominent, public events such as hurricanes and earthquakes, we are often able to use independent reports as part of our loss reserve estimation process. We also review catastrophe bulletins published by various statistical modeling agencies to assist in determining the size of the industry loss, although these reports may not be available for some time after an event. For smaller events including localized severe weather events such as windstorms, hail, ice, snow, flooding, freezing and tornadoes, which are not necessarily prominent, public occurrences, we initially place greater reliance on catastrophe bulletins published by statistical modeling agencies to assist in determining what events occurred during the reporting period than we do for large events. This includes reviewing catastrophe bulletins published by Property Claim Services for U.S. catastrophes.  We set our initial estimates of reserves for loss and LAE for these smaller events based on a combination of its historical market share for these types of losses and the estimate of the total insured industry property losses as reported by statistical modeling agencies, although we may make significant adjustments based on our current exposure to the geographic region involved as well as the size of the loss and the peril involved. \nIn general, reserves for more recent large losses are subject to greater uncertainty and, therefore, greater potential variability, and are likely to experience material changes from one period to the next. This is due to the uncertainty as to the size of the industry losses, uncertainty as to which contracts have been exposed, uncertainty due to complex legal and coverage issues that can arise out of large or complex losses, and uncertainty as to the magnitude of claims incurred by our customers. As our losses age, more information becomes available, and we believe our estimates become more certain.\nGiven the inherent variability in our loss reserves, we have developed an estimated range of possible gross reserve levels.  A table of ranges by segment, accompanied by commentary on potential and historical variability, is included in “Financial Condition - Loss and LAE Reserves”.  The ranges are developed using the exposure groups used in the published global loss triangles.  For each exposure group, our actuaries calculate a range of possible ultimate losses for each accident year. These ranges are calculated by applying a variety of different acceptable actuarial methods, and varying the parameter selections within a reasonable set of possibilities.  Our estimates of our reserve variability may not be comparable to those of other companies because there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations.  Our recorded reserves reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities, and our actuarial methodologies focus on developing such point estimates.  We calculate the ranges subsequently, based on the historical variability of such reserves.\nA&E Exposures.\n  We continue to receive claims under expired insurance and reinsurance contracts asserting injuries and/or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances, including asbestos.  Environmental claims typically assert liability for (a) the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property damage caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land, air or water.  Asbestos claims typically assert liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos.  The results of run-off A&E exposures are included within the Company’s Other segment.  \nOur reserves include an estimate of our ultimate liability for A&E claims.  There are significant uncertainties surrounding our estimates of our potential losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods; (f) questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g) uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure.  \nDue to the uncertainties discussed above, the ultimate losses attributable to A&E, and particularly asbestos, may be subject to more variability than are non-A&E reserves and such variation could have a material adverse effect on our \n51\nTable of Contents\nfinancial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.  See also ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \nReinsurance Recoverables.\n  We have purchased reinsurance to reduce our exposure to adverse claim experience, large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences.  Our ceded reinsurance provides for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances.  Such reinsurance does not relieve us of our obligation to our policyholders.  In the event our reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations under these agreements or are able to successfully challenge losses ceded by us under the contracts, we will not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable balance.  In some cases, we may hold full or partial collateral for the receivable, including letters of credit, trust assets and cash.  Additionally, creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the U.S., as well as capital markets’ reinsurance mechanisms, are generally required to secure their obligations.  We have established reserves for uncollectible balances based on our assessment of the collectability of the outstanding balances. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance comprises an allowance and an allowance for disputed balances. Based on this analysis, the Company may adjust the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance or charge off reinsurer balances that are determined to be uncollectible. \nDue to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverable become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverable, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.  \nThe allowance is estimated as the amount of reinsurance recoverable exposed to loss multiplied by estimated factors for the probability of default. The reinsurance recoverable exposed is the amount of reinsurance recoverable net of collateral and other offsets, considering the nature of the collateral, potential future changes in collateral values, and historical loss information for the type of collateral obtained.  The probability of default factors are historical insurer and reinsurer defaults for liabilities with similar durations to the reinsured liabilities as estimated through multiple economic cycles. Credit ratings are forward-looking and consider a variety of economic outcomes. The Company's evaluation of the required allowance for reinsurance recoverable considers the current economic environment as well as macroeconomic scenarios. \nThe Company records credit loss expenses related to reinsurance recoverable in incurred losses and LAE in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).  Write-offs of reinsurance recoverable and any related allowance are recorded in the period in which the balance is deemed uncollectible. \nPremiums Written and Earned.\n  Premiums written by us are earned ratably over the coverage periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts.  We establish unearned premium reserves to cover the unexpired portion of each contract.  Such reserves, for assumed reinsurance, are computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data received from ceding companies.  Premiums earned, and the related costs, which have not yet been reported to us, are estimated and accrued.  Premiums written are based on contract and policy terms and include estimates based on information received from both insureds and ceding companies.  Differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which the estimates are changed, or the actual amounts are determined.  These earned but not reported premiums are combined with reported earned premiums to comprise our total premiums earned for determination of our incurred losses and loss and LAE reserves.  Commission expense and incurred losses related to the change in earned but not reported premium are included in current period company and segment financial results.  See also ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” -  Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table displays the estimated components of net earned but not reported premiums by segment for the periods indicated:\nAt December 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nReinsurance\n$\n3,278 \n$\n2,610 \n$\n2,255 \nInsurance\n— \n— \n— \nOther\n— \n— \n— \nTotal\n$\n3,278 \n$\n2,610 \n$\n2,255 \n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\n52\nTable of Contents\nInvestment Valuation.\n  Our fixed income securities are classified for accounting purposes as either available for sale or held to maturity.  The available for sale fixed maturity securities are carried at fair value and the held to maturity fixed maturity portfolio is carried at amortized cost, net of current expected credit allowance on our consolidated balance sheets.  Our equity securities are all carried at fair value.  Some of our CMBS are valued using cash flow models and risk-adjusted discount rates.  We hold privately placed securities, less than 10% of the portfolio, which are either valued by investment advisors or the Company.  In some instances, values provided by an investment advisor are supported with opinions from qualified independent third parties.  The Company has procedures in place to review the values received from its investment advisors.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our investment portfolio included a total of $5.1 billion  and $4.5 billion of limited partnership investments, whose values are reported pursuant to the equity method of accounting, and corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) policies, whose values are reported at cash surrender value.  We carry the limited partnership investments at values provided by the managements of the limited partnerships and due to inherent reporting lags, the carrying values are based on values with “as of” dates from generally one month to one quarter prior to our financial statement date. \nAt December 31, 2024, we had net unrealized losses on our available for sale fixed maturity securities, net of tax, of $849 million, compared to net unrealized losses on our available for sale fixed maturity securities, net of tax, of $723 million at December 31, 2023.  Gains (losses) from fair value fluctuations on available for sale fixed maturity securities are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets.  Fair value declines for the available for sale fixed income portfolio, which are considered credit related, are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), as realized losses on investments.  We consider many factors when determining whether a fair value decline is credit related, including:  (1) we have no intent to sell and, more likely than not, will not be required to sell prior to recovery, (2) the credit strength of the issuer, (3) the issuer’s market sector, (4) the length of time to maturity and (5) for asset-backed securities, changes in prepayments, credit enhancements and underlying default rates.  If management’s assessments change in the future, we may ultimately record a realized loss after management originally concluded that the decline in value was not attributed to credit related factors.\nFixed maturity securities designated as held to maturity consist of debt securities for which the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity or redemption and are reported at amortized cost, net of the current expected credit loss allowance.  Interest income for fixed maturity securities held to maturity is determined in the same manner as interest income for fixed maturity securities available for sale.  The Company evaluates fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity for current expected credit losses utilizing risk characteristics of each security, including credit rating, remaining time to maturity, adjusted for prepayment considerations, and subordination level, and applying default and recovery rates, which include the incorporation of historical credit loss experience and macroeconomic forecasts, to develop an estimate of current expected credit losses.\nTax.\n  On December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (“The 2023 Act”), which will apply a 15% corporate income tax to certain Bermuda businesses in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The 2023 Act includes a provision referred to as “The Economic Transition Adjustment” (the “ETA”), which is intended to provide a fair and equitable transition into the new tax regime, and results in a deferred tax benefit for the Company. However, on January 15, 2025, the OECD issued Guidance related to “deferred tax assets arising from tax benefits provided by General Government” whereby it has restricted the utilization of those deferred tax benefits against the computation of its Pillar Two Global Minimum Taxes to approximately 20% of the originally calculated amounts and only for a grace period of two years through 2026. If the Bermuda Ministry of Finance amends The 2023 Act in response to this Guidance, the exact impact of any such amendments is uncertain but there is a risk that it results in a reduction in the Company's Deferred Tax Assets.\nThe net deferred tax assets principally relate to the identifiable intangible assets. We estimated the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets using discounted future cash flow models. The significant assumptions utilized in the discounted future cash flow models include the forecasted revenues and expected profits to be generated by the identifiable intangible assets and discount rates.\nSee also ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n53\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nInvestments.\n  Total investments were $40.0 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $4.3 billion compared to $35.7 billion at December 31, 2023.  The rise in investments was primarily related to an increase in fixed maturities - available for sale due to an overall net purchase of $1.5 billion of fixed maturities - available for sale in 2024. \nThe Company’s limited partnership investments are comprised of limited partnerships that invest in private equity, private credit and private real estate.  Generally, the limited partnerships are reported on a month or quarter lag.  We receive annual audited financial statements for all of the limited partnerships which are primarily prepared using fair value accounting in accordance with GAAP guidance.  For the quarterly reports, the Company reviews the financial reports for any unusual changes in carrying value.  If the Company becomes aware of a significant decline in value during the lag reporting period, the loss will be recorded in the period in which the Company identifies the decline.\nThe table below summarizes the composition and characteristics of our investment portfolio as of the dates indicated:\nAt December 31,\n2024\n2023\nFixed income portfolio duration (years)\n3.1\n3.3\nFixed income composite credit quality\nAA-\nAA-\nReinsurance Recoverables.\n  Reinsurance recoverables for both paid and unpaid losses totaled $3.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, $395 million, or 12.6%, was recoverable from Mt. Logan Re, Ltd. (“Mt. Logan Re”) collateralized segregated accounts; $316 million, or 10.1%, was recoverable from Munich Reinsurance America, Inc. and $187 million, or 6.0%, was recoverable from Endurance Assurance Corporation of America.  No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of our recoverables.\nLoss and LAE Reserves.\n  Gross loss and LAE reserves totaled $29.9 billion and $24.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following tables summarize gross outstanding loss and LAE reserves by segment, classified by case reserves and IBNR reserves, for the periods indicated:\nAt December 31, 2024\n(Dollars in millions)\nCase\nReserves\nIBNR\nReserves\nTotal\nReserves\n% of\nTotal\nReinsurance\n$\n6,591 \n$\n13,117 \n$\n19,708 \n65.9 \n%\nInsurance\n2,289 \n6,552 \n8,841 \n29.6 \n%\nOther\n (1)\n389 \n950 \n1,340 \n4.5 \n%\nTotal\n$\n9,270 \n$\n20,619 \n$\n29,889 \n100.0 \n%\n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\n(1) \nReserves for A&E exposures are included within Other.

At December 31, 2023, A&E Case and IBNR reserves totaled $159 million and $88 million, respectively. \nChanges in premiums earned and business mix, reserve refinement, catastrophe losses and changes in catastrophe loss reserves and claim settlement activity all impact loss and LAE reserves by segment and in total.\nOur carried loss and LAE reserves represent management’s best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims.  We continuously re-evaluate our reserves, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim experience.  Changes in reserves resulting from \n54\nTable of Contents\nsuch re-evaluations are reflected in incurred losses in the period when the re-evaluation is made.  Our analytical methods and processes operate at multiple levels including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes and lines of business, internal business units, segments, accident years, legal entities and in the aggregate.  In order to set appropriate reserves, we make qualitative and quantitative analyses and judgments at these various levels.  We utilize actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended to ensure the accuracy and consistency of our reserving practices.  Management’s best estimate is developed through collaboration with actuarial, underwriting, claims, legal and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees. Each segment reserve committee includes the participation of the relevant parties from actuarial, finance, claims and segment senior management.  Reserves are further reviewed by Everest’s Chief Reserving Actuary and senior management.  The objective of such process is to determine a single best estimate viewed by management to be the best estimate of its ultimate loss liability.   Nevertheless, our reserves are estimates, which are subject to variation, which may be significant.\nThere can be no assurance that reserves for, and losses from, claim obligations will not increase in the future, possibly by a material amount.  However, we believe that our existing reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have included ranges for loss reserve estimates determined by our actuaries, which have been developed through a combination of objective and subjective criteria.  Our presentation of this information may not be directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations.  Our recorded reserves are an aggregation of our best point estimates for approximately 200 reserve groups and reflect our best point estimate of our liabilities. Our actuarial methodologies develop point estimates rather than ranges and the ranges are developed subsequently based upon historical and prospective variability measures.\nThe following table below represents the reserve levels and ranges for each of our business segments for the period indicated:\nOutstanding Reserves and Ranges By Segment\n (1)\nAt December 31, 2024\n(Dollars in millions)\nAs\nReported\nLow\nRange %\nLow\nRange\nHigh\nRange %\nHigh\nRange\nGross Reserves By Segment\nReinsurance\n$\n19,708 \n(7.7)\n%\n$\n18,191 \n5.6 \n%\n$\n20,817 \nInsurance\n8,841 \n(14.2)\n%\n7,583 \n7.3 \n%\n9,488 \nOther (excluding A&E)\n1,080 \n(26.8)\n%\n790 \n5.3 \n%\n1,137 \nTotal Gross Reserves (excluding A&E)\n29,630 \n(10.3)\n%\n26,565 \n6.1 \n%\n31,443 \nA&E (Other Segment) \n260 \n(21.6)\n%\n204 \n21.6 \n%\n316 \nTotal Gross Reserves\n$\n29,889 \n(10.4)\n%\n26,768 \n6.3 \n%\n31,759 \n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\n(1) \nThere can be no assurance that reserves will not ultimately exceed the indicated ranges requiring additional income (loss) statement expense.\nThe size of the range is dependent upon the level of confidence associated with the reserve estimates.  Within each range, management’s best estimate of loss reserves is based upon the point estimate\n \nderived by our actuaries in detailed reserve studies.  Such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development.  There can be no assurance that our claim obligations will not vary outside of these ranges.\nAdditional losses, including those relating to latent injuries, and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by us or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally, may emerge in the future.  Such future emergence, to the extent not covered by existing retrocessional contracts, could have material adverse effects on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA&E Exposures.\n  A&E exposures represent a separate exposure group for monitoring and evaluating reserve adequacy.  The results of run-off A&E exposures are included within the Company’s Other segment.  \nWith respect to asbestos only, at December 31, 2024, we had net asbestos loss reserves of $216 million, or 89.0%, of total net A&E reserves, all of which was for assumed business.  At December 31, 2024, we had gross asbestos loss reserves of $233 million, or 89.6% of total  gross A&E reserves, all of which was for assumed business.\n55\nTable of Contents\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of A&E Exposures.\nUltimate loss projections for A&E liabilities cannot be accomplished using standard actuarial techniques.  We believe that our A&E reserves represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate liability; however, there can be no assurance that ultimate loss payments will not exceed such reserves, perhaps by a significant amount.\nIndustry analysts use the “survival ratio” to compare the A&E reserves among companies with such liabilities.  The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a company’s current net reserves by the three-year average of annual paid losses.  Hence, the survival ratio equals the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves if future loss payments were to continue at historical levels.  Using this measurement, our net three-year asbestos survival ratio was 6.6 years at December 31, 2024.  These metrics can be skewed by individual large settlements occurring in the prior three years and therefore, may not be indicative of the timing of future payments.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCapital.\n  Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $13.9 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively.  Management’s objective in managing capital is to ensure that the Company’s overall capital level, as well as the capital levels of its operating subsidiaries, exceed the amounts required by regulators, the amount needed to support our current financial strength ratings from rating agencies and our own economic capital models.  The Company’s capital has historically exceeded these benchmark levels.\nOur two main operating companies, Bermuda Re and Everest Re, are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the “BMA”) and the State of Delaware’s Department of Insurance, respectively.  Both regulatory bodies have their own capital adequacy models based on statutory capital as opposed to GAAP basis equity.  Bermuda Re is subject to the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (“BSCR”) administered by the BMA and Everest Re is subject to the RBC developed by the U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”).  Failure to meet the required statutory capital levels could result in various regulatory restrictions, including restrictions on business activity and the payment of dividends to their parent companies.\nThe regulatory targeted capital and the actual statutory capital for Bermuda Re and Everest Re were as follows:\nBermuda Re \n(1)\nAt December 31,\nEverest Re \n(2)\nAt December 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024 ⁽³⁾\n2023\n2024\n2023\nRegulatory targeted capital\n$\n— \n$\n2,669 \n$\n4,799 \n$\n4,242 \nActual capital\n$\n4,323 \n$\n3,711 \n$\n8,126 \n$\n6,963 \n(1)\nRegulatory targeted capital represents the target capital level from the applicable year's BSCR calculation.\n(2)\nRegulatory targeted capital represents 200% of the RBC authorized control level calculation for the applicable year. \n(3)\nThe 2024 BSCR calculation is not yet due to be completed; however, the Company anticipates that Bermuda Re's December 31, 2024 actual capital will exceed the targeted capital level.  In accordance with guidance issued by the BMA in 2025, Bermuda Re has reflected the impacts of the ETA recognized in response to The 2023 Act in its 2024 regulatory targeted capital and actual capital.\nOur financial strength ratings, as determined by A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Moody’s and S&P, are important, as they provide our customers and investors with an independent assessment of our financial strength using a rating scale that provides for relative comparisons.  We continue to possess significant financial flexibility and access to debt and equity markets as a result of our financial strength, as evidenced by the financial strength ratings assigned by independent rating agencies.  See also ITEM 1, Business - “Financial Strength Ratings”.\nWe maintain our own economic capital models to monitor and project our overall capital, as well as the capital at our operating subsidiaries.  A key input to the economic models is projected income, and this input is continually compared to actual results, which may require a change in the capital strategy.\nIn 2024, we repurchased 536,469 of our common shares at a cost of $200 million in the open market and paid $334 million in common share dividends to adjust our capital position and enhance long-term expected returns to our shareholders.  During 2023, we repurchased no shares in the open market and paid $288 million in dividends.  We may at times enter into a Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan agreement to facilitate the repurchase of shares. On November 7, 2024, our existing Board authorization to purchase up to 32 million of our shares was increased by 10 million shares to authorize the purchase of up to 42 million shares.  As of December 31, 2024, we had repurchased 31.3 million shares under this authorization.  During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly \n56\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock dividend of $2.00 per share.  The common stock dividend was paid on December 13, 2024 for holders of record as of November 27, 2024.\nOn May 19, 2023, the Company completed the public offering of 4,140,000 common shares, which included full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 540,000 common shares, at a public offering price of $360.00 per share. Total net proceeds from the public offering were $1,445 million, after underwriting discount and expenses. The Company’s intent was to use the net proceeds from this offering for long-term reinsurance opportunity and continued build out of the global insurance business.\nLiquidity.\n  Our liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations.  Positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims, with disbursements generally taking place over an extended period after the collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years.  Collected premiums are generally invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and investment income provides additional funding for loss payments.  Our net cash flows from operating activities were $5.0 billion and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Additionally, these cash flows reflected net catastrophe loss payments of $693 million and $858 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net tax payments of $397 million and $196 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIf disbursements for losses and LAE, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses were to exceed premium inflows, cash flow from reinsurance and insurance operations would be negative.  The effect on cash flow from operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income. Additionally, cash inflows from investment maturities of both short-term investments and longer-term maturities are available to supplement other operating cash flows.  We do not expect to supplement negative operations cash flows with investment dispositions.\nAs the timing of payments for losses and LAE cannot be predicted with certainty, we maintain portfolios of long-term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments that provide additional liquidity for payment of claims.  At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held cash and short-term investments of $6.3 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.  Our short-term investments are generally readily marketable and can be converted to cash.  In addition to these cash and short-term investments, we had $1.1 billion of fixed maturity securities - available for sale maturing within one year or less, $8.5 billion maturing within one to five years and $6.2 billion maturing after five years at December 31, 2024.  We believe that these fixed maturity securities, in conjunction with the short-term investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide ample sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses and LAE in the near future.  We do not anticipate selling a significant amount of securities to pay losses and LAE.  At December 31, 2024, we had $990 million of net pre-tax unrealized depreciation related to fixed maturity - available for sale securities, comprised of $1.2 billion of pre-tax unrealized depreciation and $167 million of pre-tax unrealized appreciation.\nManagement generally expects annual positive cash flow from operations.  However, given catastrophic events observed in recent periods, cash flow from operations may decline and could become negative in the near term as significant claim payments are made related to the catastrophes.  However, as indicated above, the Company has access to ample liquidity to settle its catastrophe claims and also may receive payments under the catastrophe bond program and the Mt. Logan Re collateralized reinsurance arrangement.\nIn addition to our cash flows from operations and liquid investments, Everest Re is a member of the FHLBNY, which allows Everest Re to borrow up to 10% of its statutory admitted assets.  As of December 31, 2024, Everest Re had statutory admitted assets of approximately $30.8 billion which provides borrowing capacity of up to approximately $3.1 billion.  As of December 31, 2024, Everest Re had $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding, which begin to expire in 2025.  See Note 7 - Credit Facilities to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K for further details.\nExposure to Catastrophes.\n  Like other insurance and reinsurance companies, we are exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory. A large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties, facultative certificates and direct insurance policies across various lines of business.\nWe focus on potential losses that could result from any single event, or series of events as part of our evaluation and monitoring of our aggregate exposures to catastrophic events. Accordingly, we employ various techniques to estimate the amount of loss we could sustain from any single catastrophic event or series of events in various geographic areas. These techniques range from deterministic approaches, such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe-prone \n57\nTable of Contents\nzones and applying reasonable damage factors, to modeled approaches that attempt to scientifically measure catastrophe loss exposure using sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of potential losses on a probabilistic basis.\nNo single computer model or group of models is currently capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which we conduct business. In addition, the form, quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by (re)insureds is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for our licensed models, which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections. Further, the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined to estimate potential losses by and across business units.  Also, while most models have been updated to incorporate claims information from recent catastrophic events, catastrophe model projections are still inherently imprecise.  In addition, uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles could add further uncertainty to loss projections from models based on historical data.\nNevertheless, when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events.\nProjected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss (“PML”).  We define PML as our anticipated loss, taking into account contract terms and limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake.  The PML will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the make-up of the in-force book of business.  The projected severity levels are described in terms of “return periods”, such as “100-year events” and “250-year events”. For example, a 100-year PML is the estimated loss to the current in-force portfolio from a single event which has a 1% probability of being exceeded in a twelve-month period.  In other words, it corresponds to a 99% probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated PML.  It is important to note that PMLs are estimates.  Modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model.  As a result, there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML.\nFrom an enterprise risk management perspective, management sets limits on the levels of catastrophe loss exposure we may underwrite.  The limits are revised periodically based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to our financial resources and expected earnings and risk/reward analyses of the business being underwritten.\nEconomic loss is the PML exposure, net of third-party reinsurance including catastrophe industry loss warranty cover, reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and estimated income taxes.  The impact of income taxes on the PML depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity, which is also affected by inter-affiliate reinsurance.  Management also monitors and controls its largest PMLs at multiple points along the loss distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250 and 500-year return periods.  This process enables management to identify and control exposure accumulations and to integrate such exposures into enterprise risk, underwriting and capital management decisions.\nOur catastrophe loss projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process.  Each segment and business unit manages its underwriting risk in accordance with established guidelines. These guidelines place dollar limits on the amount of business that can be written based on a variety of factors, including (re)insured company profile, line of business, geographic location and risk hazards. In each case, the guidelines permit limited exceptions, which must be authorized by the Company’s senior management. Management regularly reviews and revises these guidelines in response to changes in business unit product offerings, market conditions, risk versus reward analyses and our enterprise and underwriting risk management processes. \nOur operating results and financial condition can be adversely affected by catastrophe and other large losses. We manage our exposure to catastrophes and other large losses by: \n•\nselective underwriting practices;\n•\ndiversifying our risk portfolio by geographic area and by types and classes of business;\n•\nlimiting our aggregate catastrophe loss exposure in any particular geographic zone and contiguous zones;\n58\nTable of Contents\n•\npurchasing reinsurance and/or retrocessional protection to the extent that such coverage can be secured cost-effectively. See “Reinsurance and Retrocession Arrangements”. \nWe believe that our methods of monitoring, analyzing and managing catastrophe exposures provide a credible risk management framework, which is integrated with our enterprise risk management, underwriting and capital management plans.\n \nHowever, there is much uncertainty and imprecision inherent in the catastrophe models and the catastrophe loss estimation process generally.\n \nAs a result, there can be no assurance that we will not experience losses from individual events that exceed the PML or other return period projections, perhaps by a material amount.\n \nNor can there be assurance that we will not experience events impacting multiple zones, or multiple severe events that could, in the aggregate, exceed our PML expectations by a significant amount.\nThe table below reflects our PML exposure, net of third-party reinsurance including catastrophe industry loss warranty cover, at various return periods for our top zones/perils (as ranked by the largest 1 in 100-year economic loss) based on loss projection data as of January 1, 2025:\nReturn Periods (in years)\n1 in 20\n1 in 50\n1 in 100\n1 in 250\n1 in 500\nExceeding Probability\n5.0%\n2.0%\n1.0%\n0.4%\n0.2%\n(Dollars in millions)\nZone\nPeril\nSoutheast U.S.\nWind\n$\n920 \n$\n1,509 \n$\n2,174 \n$\n2,661 \n$\n2,873 \nCalifornia\nEarthquake\n227 \n1,038 \n1,791 \n2,535 \n2,829 \nTexas\nWind\n205 \n508 \n921 \n1,717 \n2,432 \nThe projected net economic losses, defined as PML exposures, net of third-party reinsurance including catastrophe industry loss warranty cover, reinstatement premiums and estimated income taxes, for the top zones/perils scheduled above are as follows:\nReturn Periods (in years)\n1 in 20\n1 in 50\n1 in 100\n1 in 250\n1 in 500\nExceeding Probability\n5.0%\n2.0%\n1.0%\n0.4%\n0.2%\n(Dollars in millions)\nZone\nPeril\nSoutheast U.S.\nWind\n$\n640 \n$\n1,029 \n$\n1,523 \n$\n1,866 \n$\n2,049 \nCalifornia\nEarthquake\n176 \n742 \n1,322 \n1,842 \n2,073 \nTexas\nWind\n153 \n375 \n665 \n1,219 \n1,740 \nWe believe that our greatest worldwide 1 in 100-year exposure to a single catastrophic event is to a wind event affecting the Southeast U.S., where we estimate we have a PML exposure, net of third party reinsurance including catastrophe industry loss warranty cover, of $2.2 billion which represents approximately 11.0% of its December 31, 2024 shareholders’ equity.\nIf such a single catastrophe loss were to occur, management estimates that the net economic loss to us would be approximately $1.5 billion.  The estimate involves multiple variables, including which Everest entity would experience the loss, and as a result there can be no assurance that this amount would not be exceeded.\nWe may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of our operations.  Reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing, terms, conditions, availability and collectability of coverage, with the aim of securing cost-effective protection from financially secure counterparts.  The amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time, reflecting our view of our exposures and the cost of reinsurance.  In recent years, we have increased our use of reinsurance offered through capital market facilities.\nWe participate in “common account” retrocessional arrangements for certain reinsurance treaties whereby a ceding company purchases reinsurance for the benefit of itself and its reinsurers under one or more of its reinsurance treaties.\n \n59\nTable of Contents\nCommon account retrocessional arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all participating companies, including the ceding company, with respect to the involved treaties.\nInformation Technology.\n  Everest’s information technology is a key component of its business operations.  Information technology systems and services are hosted at public and private cloud service providers across multiple data centers with processing performed at the office locations of our operating subsidiaries and branches.  We have implemented security procedures, and regularly assess and enhance our security protocols, to ensure that our key business systems are protected, secured and backed up at off-site locations so that they can be restored promptly if necessary.  We have business continuity plans and disaster recovery plans along with periodic testing of those plans to ensure we are capable of providing uninterrupted technology services in the event of major systems outages with alternative secure data centers available in case of broader outages.\nOur business operations depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology platform, which includes data processing and related electronic communications.  We communicate electronically internally and externally with our brokers, program managers, clients, third-party vendors, regulators and others.  These communications and the data we handle may include personal, confidential or proprietary information.  We ensure that all our systems, data and electronic transmissions are appropriately protected with the latest technology safeguards and meet regulatory standards.\nDespite these safeguards, a significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach and disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations and possibly our results.  This type of incident may result in a violation of applicable data security, privacy, or other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to regulatory scrutiny as well as monetary fines and other penalties.  Management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations.  See also ITEM 1C, “Cybersecurity”.\nExpected Cash Outflows.\n  The following table shows our significant expected cash outflows for the period indicated.\nPayments due by period\n(Dollars in millions)\nTotal\nLess than\n1 year\n1-3 years\n3-5 years\nMore than\n5 years\nSenior notes\n$\n2,400 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n2,400 \nLong term notes\n219 \n— \n— \n— \n219 \nFederal Home Loan Bank of New York\n1,019 \n719 \n300 \n— \n— \nInterest expense\n (1)\n2,833 \n101 \n203 \n203 \n2,325 \nOperating lease agreements\n152 \n21 \n37 \n27 \n67 \nGross reserve for losses and LAE \n(2)\n29,889 \n3,486 \n8,951 \n7,764 \n9,689 \nTotal\n$\n36,512 \n$\n4,327 \n$\n9,491 \n$\n7,994 \n$\n14,700 \n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\n(1)\nInterest expense on long-term notes is calculated at the variable floating rate of 7.17%, as of December 31, 2024.  \n(2)\nLoss and LAE reserves represent management’s best estimate of losses from claim and related settlement costs.  Both the amounts and timing of such payments are estimates, and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as changes in market conditions make the timing of cash flows uncertain.  Therefore, the ultimate amount and timing of loss and LAE payments could differ from our estimates.  \nThe cash outflows for senior notes and long-term notes are the responsibility of Holdings.  We strive to ensure that we have sufficient cash flow, liquidity, investments and access to capital markets to satisfy these obligations.  Holdings generally depends upon dividends from Everest Re, its operating insurance subsidiary for its funding, capital contributions from Group or access to the capital markets.  Our various operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have sufficient cash flow, liquidity and investments to settle outstanding reserves for losses and LAE.  Management believes that we, and each of our entities, have sufficient financial resources or ready access thereto, to meet all obligations.\nDividends.\nDuring 2024 and 2023, we declared and paid common shareholder dividends of $334 million and $288 million, respectively.  As an insurance holding company, we are partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to our shareholders.  The payment of dividends to Group by Holdings Ireland and Everest Dublin Holdings is subject to Irish corporate and regulatory restrictions; the payment of dividends to Holdings Ireland by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions; and the payment of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re, Everest International, Everest Preferred International Holdings (“Preferred \n60\nTable of Contents\nHoldings”), Everest Re Advisors Ltd. (“Advisors Re”) or Mt. Logan Re is subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions.  Management expects that, absent extraordinary catastrophe losses, such restrictions should not affect Everest Re’s ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Holdings’ general corporate needs and that Holdings Ireland, Everest Dublin Holdings, Bermuda Re and Everest International will have the ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Group’s general corporate needs.  For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Everest Re paid no cash dividends to Holdings.   For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Bermuda Re paid cash dividends to Group of $750 million and $235 million, respectively; Everest International paid cash dividends to Group of $100 million and $0 million, respectively; Preferred Holdings paid cash dividends to Group of $46 million and $48 million, respectively; Advisors Re paid cash dividends to Group of $74 million and $67 million, respectively; and Mt. Logan Re paid cash dividends to Group of $0 million and $15 million, respectively.  See ITEM 1, “Business - Regulatory Matters - Dividends” and ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” - Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMarket Sensitive Instruments.\nSEC Registrants are required to clarify and expand upon the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, “Market Sensitive Instruments”).  We do not generally enter into Market Sensitive Instruments for trading purposes.\nOur current investment strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity.  Our mix of investments is adjusted periodically, consistent with our current and projected operating results and market conditions.  The fixed maturity securities in the investment portfolio are comprised of available for sale and held to maturity securities.  Additionally, we have invested in equity securities.\nThe overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations.  In particular, estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability transactions, together with our capital structure and other factors, are used to develop a net liability analysis.  This analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which our investments provide liquidity.  This analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation, duration and credit quality.  The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period.\nOur $41.5 billion investment portfolio at December 31, 2024, is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities, which are generally subject to interest rate risk and some foreign currency exchange rate risk, and some equity securities, which are subject to price fluctuations and some foreign exchange rate risk.  The overall economic impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is partially mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated liabilities and their associated income statement impact. \nInterest Rate Risk.\n  Interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio from a change in market interest rates.  In a declining interest rate environment, interest rate risk includes prepayment risk on the $7.1 billion of mortgage-backed securities in the $29.7 billion fixed maturity portfolio.  Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security.\nThe tables below display the potential impact of fair value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on our fixed maturity portfolio (including $4.7 billion of short-term investments) for the period indicated based on upward and downward parallel and immediate 100 and 200 basis point shifts in interest rates.  For legal entities with a U.S. dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each security individually.  To generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed securities, changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account.  For legal entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the fair value change under the various interest rate change scenarios.  \n61\nTable of Contents\nImpact of Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points\nAt December 31, 2024\n-200\n-100\n0\n100\n200\n(Dollars in millions)\nTotal Fair Value\n$\n36,514 \n$\n35,443 \n$\n34,372 \n$\n33,302 \n$\n32,231 \nFair Value Change from Base (%)\n6.2 \n%\n3.1 \n%\n— \n%\n(3.1)\n%\n(6.2)\n%\nChange in Unrealized Appreciation\nAfter-tax from Base ($)\n$\n1,834 \n$\n917 \n$\n— \n$\n(917)\n$\n(1,834)\nImpact of Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points\nAt December 31, 2023\n-200\n-100\n0\n100\n200\n(Dollars in millions)\nTotal Fair Value\n$\n32,813 \n$\n31,768 \n$\n30,722 \n$\n29,677 \n$\n28,631 \nFair Value Change from Base (%)\n6.8 \n%\n3.4 \n%\n— \n%\n(3.4)\n%\n(6.8)\n%\nChange in Unrealized Appreciation\nAfter-tax from Base ($)\n$\n1,811 \n$\n905 \n$\n— \n$\n(905)\n$\n(1,811)\nWe had $29.9 billion and $24.6 billion of gross reserves for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  These amounts are recorded at their nominal value, as opposed to present value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money.  Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the present value of the reserves is less than the nominal value.  As interest rates rise, the present value of the reserves decreases and, conversely, as interest rates decline, the present value increases.  These movements are similar to the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments held.  While the difference between present value and nominal value is not reflected in our financial statements, our financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid.  Our loss and loss reserve obligations have an expected duration of approximately 4.0 years, which is reasonably consistent with our fixed income portfolio.  If we were to discount our loss and LAE reserves, net of ceded reserves, the discount would be approximately $4.9 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of approximately $22.1 billion, representing approximately 64.4% of the value of the fixed maturity investment portfolio funds.  \nForeign Currency Risk.\n  Foreign currency risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Each of our non-U.S./Bermuda operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines.  Each non-U.S. operation may conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates.  The primary foreign currency exposures for these non-U.S. operations are the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro.  We mitigate foreign exchange exposure by generally matching the currency and duration of our assets to our corresponding operating liabilities.  In accordance with GAAP guidance, the impact on the fair value of available for sale fixed maturities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in relation to functional currency, is reflected as part of other comprehensive income.  Conversely, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in relation to functional currency, on other assets and liabilities is reflected through net income as a component of other income (expense).  In addition, we translate the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to the U.S. dollar.  This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income.  \nThe tables below display the potential impact of a parallel and immediate 10% and 20% increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure for the periods indicated.  This analysis includes the after-tax impact of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after-tax impact of translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. \nChange in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent\nAt December 31, 2024\n(Dollars in millions)\n-20%\n-10%\n0%\n10%\n20%\nTotal After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure\n$\n(1,426)\n$\n(713)\n$\n— \n$\n713 \n$\n1,426 \n62\nTable of Contents\nChange in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent\nAt December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in millions)\n-20%\n-10%\n0%\n10%\n20%\nTotal After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure\n$\n(1,022)\n$\n(511)\n$\n— \n$\n511 \n$\n1,022",
