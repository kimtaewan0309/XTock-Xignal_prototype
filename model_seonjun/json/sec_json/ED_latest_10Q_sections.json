(Con Edison) and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (CECONY). As used in this report, the term the “Companies” refers to Con Edison and CECONY. CECONY is a subsidiary of Con Edison and, as such, information in this MD&A about CECONY applies to Con Edison.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Third Quarter Financial Statements and the notes thereto and the MD&A in Item 7 of the Companies’ combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (File Nos.1-14514 and 1-01217, the Form 10-K) and the MD&A in Part 1, Item 2 of the Companies' combined Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025 (File Nos. 1-14514 and 1-01217). \nInformation in any item of this report referred to in this discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as “see” or “refer to” shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made.\nCon Edison, incorporated in New York State in 1997, is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of CECONY, Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R) and Con Edison Transmission, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Con Edison Transmission”). As used in this report, the term the “Utilities” refers to CECONY and O&R. \n \nCon Edison\nCECONY\nO&R\nCon Edison Transmission\n•\nRECO\nCon Edison’s principal business operations are those of the Utilities and Con Edison Transmission. CECONY’s principal business operations are its regulated electric, gas and steam delivery businesses. O&R’s principal business operations are its regulated electric and gas delivery businesses. Con Edison Transmis\nsion, a regulated company primarily under the oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), develops and invests in electric transmission projects and owns, through joint ventures, both electric and gas assets. Con Edison \nTransmission is considering strategic alternatives with respect to its investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP) and both Con Edison Transmission and CECONY are considering strategic alternatives with respect to their investments in Honeoye Storage Corporation (Honeoye). See \n“\nInvestments\n”\n in Note A to the Third Quarter Financial Statements and \n“Con Edison Transmission” below\n.\nCon Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and electric transmission assets. Con Edison invests to provide reliable, resilient, safe and clean energy critical for its New York and New Jersey customers. Con Edison is a responsible neighbor, helping the communities it serves become more sustainable.\nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A and the Companies’ material contingencies described in Notes B, G and H to the Third Quarter Financial Statements, the Companies’ management considers the following events, trends, and uncertainties to be important to understanding the Companies’ current and future financial condition.\n51\nAged Accounts Receivable Balances\nAt September 30, 2025, CECONY’s and O&R’s customer accounts receivables balances of $2,843 million and $121 million, respectively, included aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $1,511 million and $28 million, respectively. At December 31, 2024, CECONY’s and O&R’s customer accounts receivables balances of $2,947 million and $113 million, respectively, included aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $1,652 million and $32 million, respectively. In comparison, CECONY’s and O&R’s customer accounts receivable balances at February 28, 2020 were $1,322 million and $89 million, respectively, including aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $408 million and $15 million, respectively. Prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Utilities’ practice was to write off customer accounts receivables as uncollectible 90 days after the account is disconnected for non-payment or the account is closed during the collection process. In general, the Utilities suspended collection activities and service disconnections during the COVID-19 pandemic and have since resumed such activities. \nCECONY’s 2023 - 2025 electric and gas rate plans include reconciliation of late payment charges (from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025 and from January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2026 for steam and write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances (from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2025 for electric and gas and from January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2026 for steam) to amounts reflected in rates, with recovery/refund from or to customers via surcharge/surcredit. CECONY's surcharge recoveries for late payment charges and write-offs of accounts receivable balances will, collectively, be subject to separate annual caps for electric and gas that produce no more than a half percent (0.5 percent) total customer bill impact per commodity (estimated for electric to be $57.3 million, $60.3 million, $62.6 milli\non for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, and for gas to be $14.8 million, $15.9 million and $16.8 million for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively). CECONY's surcharge recoveries for late payment charges and write-offs of accounts receivables for steam will each be subject to an annual cap that produces no more than a half percent (0.5 percent) total customer bill impact (estimated to be $2.5 million, $3.0 million and $3.5 million for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively). Amounts in excess of the surcharge caps will be deferred as a regulatory asset for recovery in CECONY’s next base rate cases. CECONY’s November 2025 joint proposal, that is subject to approval by the NYSPSC, includes reconciliation of late payment charges during the rate plan pursuant to which CECONY will calculate the annual difference between (i) its actual uncollectible expenses and late payment charges and (ii) the levels of uncollectible expenses and late payment charges provided in rates. In the event the actual net expenses (uncollectible expenses plus late payment charges) are below the amounts in rates, CECONY will defer the full variance as a regulatory liability and refund to customers via surcredit. In the event the actual net expenses are above the amounts in rates, CECONY will defer the full annual variance above $10 million ($8.5 million for electric and $1.5 million for gas) in 2026; above $15 million ($12.75 million for electric and $2.25 million for gas) in 2027; and above $20 million ($17.0 million for electric and $3.0 million for gas) in 2028; as a regulatory asset for recovery via surcharge.\nO&R’s 2025 – 2027 rate plans include reconciliation of uncollectible expenses and late payment charges that are subject to a combined annual threshold of $0.9 million and $0.5 million for electric and gas, respectively. Once the threshold is met, O&R will defer the variance between actual uncollectible expense and late payment charge, and the level set forth in rates that is above the threshold. Recovery/refunds will be made via surcharge/surcredit. Surcharge recovery is subject to an annual cap that produces no more than a 0.5 percent total customer bill impact \nper commodity. Amounts in excess of the surcharge caps will be deferred as a regulatory asset for recovery in O&R’s next base rate cases. \nAlthough these regulatory mechanisms are currently in place, the Utilities’ ability to effectively manage their customer accounts receivable balances, and obtain recovery in rates for their respective carrying costs and any related write-offs could have a material impact on the Companies’ businesses. In addition, a continued increase in accounts receivable balances has impacted and is expected to continue to impac\nt the Companies’ liquidity. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” below, and Note B and Note L to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.\nIn particular, CECONY, in an effort to reduce aged accounts receivables balances, plans to continue to execute on its integrated collections strategy, which includes, among other things, implementation of payment arrangements, enhanced digital and mail communications to customers regarding collections, increased field collections by recently having hired additional field collectors and increasing collector efficiency and employing additional call center representatives to handle in-bound call volumes a\nnd to place outbound calls to customers regarding collections. O&R's collection strategy aligns with that of CEC\nONY's in many respects.  \nElectric Supply\nMost of the electricity sold by CECONY to its full-service customers in 2025 was purchased through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. To reduce the volatility of its full-service customers’ electric energy costs, the company enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its expected purchases through the NYISO’s wholesale electricity market.\n52\nThe NYISO is interconnected with two Canadian system operators, Ontario’s Independent Electricity System Operator and Hydro-Québec, allowing for up to approximately 2500 MW and 2100 MW of imports from Ontario to New York and from Quebec to New York, respectively. \nBeginning in February 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order imposing a 10 percent tariff on most Canadian imports to the United States of “energy or energy resources.” This executive order took effect on March 4, 2025 with an exemption for goods compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The federal government has not provided guidance regarding the applicability of tariffs to imported Canadian electricity and, as of September 30, 2025, no tariffs are being applied to electricity sales. In March 2025, Ontario announced a 25 percent surcharge on all U.S.-bound electricity that was subsequently paused. See \"Federal Regulation,\" below.\nThese tariffs, if implemented, may result in increases in electric commodity prices. The Utilities do not make any margin or profit on the electricity they sell and generally recover these costs pursuant to their rate plans. See \"Aged Accounts Receivable Balances,\" above and \"Commodity Price Risk,\" below.\nThe Companies continue to monitor these developments closely to assess any potential impact on the Companies. The Companies are unable to predict changes in regulations, regulatory guidance, legal interpretations, policy positions and implementation actions that may result from these governmental actions. \nFederal Regulation\nBeginning in January 2025, a series of executive orders, presidential memoranda and proclamations were issued (collectively, Presidential Actions) designed to address areas such as tariffs, environm\nental and energy regulations, domestic energy production and retention of domestic generation resources, among other things. The situation remains fluid and is subject to rapid change.\nIn April 2025, an executive order was issued by the President of the United States that directs the Attorney General to identify and take action against state laws and policies that burden the use of domestic energy resources and that are unconstitutional, preempted by federal law, or otherwise unenforceable (the April 2025 Executive Order). The \nApril 2025 Executive Order directs the Attorney General to identify and stop the enforcement of laws and policies purporting to address climate change or involving environmental, social and governance initiatives, environmental justice, carbon or greenhouse gas emissions and funds to collect carbon penalties or carbon taxes.  \nDuring 2025, the federal government has issued numerous executive orders imposing tariffs on imports, many of which have since been modified, stayed, or are the subject of litigation. Although these tariffs have not had a significant impact on the Companies’ operations or financial condition to date, the cost of materials have increased  during 2025 across various supply chain contract portfolios. If the tariffs remain in place, the cost of materials is anticipated to continue to increase and also may lead to supply chain disruptions. The Companies continue to monitor these developments closely to assess any potential additional impact on the Companies. The Companies are unable to predict changes in regulations, regulatory guidance, legal interpretations, policy positions and i\nmplementation actions that may result from the Presidential Actions and the April 2025 Executive Order. \nClean Energy Goals\nThe \nsuccess of the Companies’ \nefforts to meet federal, state and city clean energy policy goals and the impact of energy consumers' efforts to meet such goals on CECONY’s electric, gas and steam businesses and O&R’s electric and gas businesses may impact the Companies’ future financial condition. The Utilities expect electric usage to increase and gas and steam usage to decrease in their service territories as federal, state and local laws and policies are enacted and implemented that aim to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy that is consumed in their respective jurisdictions. The Utilities’ and their regulators’ efforts to maintain electric reliability in their service territories as electric usage increases may also impact the Companies’ future financial condition. The long-term future of the Utilities’ gas businesses depends upon the role that natural gas or other gaseous fuels will play in facilitating New York State’s and New York City’s climate goals. In addition, the impact and costs from climate change impacts on the Utilities’ systems and the success of the Utilities’ efforts to maintain system reliability and manage service interruptions resulting from severe weather may impact the Companies’ future financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See “Federal Regulation,” above.\n53\nCon Edison Transmission\nCon Edison Transmission, through its New York Transco partnership and jointly with the New York Power Authority (NYPA), is developing the Propel NY Energy transmission project, a 90-mile electric transmission project that is expected to increase high voltage transmission connections between Long Island and the rest of New York State. See the table under \"Con Edison Transmission,\" below. Con Edison Transmission also participates in competitive solicitations to develop additional electric projects. The success of Con Edison Transmission’s efforts in these competitive solicitations and to grow its electric transmission portfolio may impact Con Edison’s future capital requirements. In January 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order temporarily withdrawing all areas on the outer continental shelf from new offshore wind leasing, pending review by the new Administration, noting that nothing in this withdrawal affects rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas, and further that with respect to such existing leases, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Attorney General as needed, shall conduct a comprehensive review of the ecological, economic, and environmental necessity of terminating or amending any existing wind energy leases. In July 2025, the NYSPSC issued an order withdrawing the public policy transmission need (PPTN) process given actions taken by the federal government that reduced the prospects for the construction of the offshore wind resources that were anticipated to be served by the proposed transmission solutions. See “Federal Regulation,” above and “Environmental Matters – Offshore Wind,” below.\nCon Edison Transmission is considering strategic alternatives with respect to its investment in MVP and both Con Edison Transmission and CECONY are considering strategic alternatives with respect to their investments in Honeoye. \nCECONY\nElectric\nCECONY provides electric service to approximat\nely 3.8 millio\nn customers in all of New York City (except a part of Queens) and most of Westchester County, an approximately 660 square mile service area with a population of more than nine million.  \nDuring the summer of 2025, electric peak demand in CECONY's service area was 12,530 MW (which occurred on June 25, 2025). At design conditions, electric peak demand in CECONY's service area would have been approximately 12,600 MW in 2025 compared to CECONY's forecast of 12,610 MW.\nGas\nCECONY delivers gas to approxima\ntely 1.1 million\n customers in Manhattan, the Bronx, parts of Queens and most of Westchester County.\nIn June 2025, CECONY increased its five-year forecast of average annual growth of the firm peak gas demand in its service area at de\nsign conditions from approximately 0.1 percent (for 2025 to 2029) to approximately 0.2 percent (for 2026 to 2030).\nSteam\nCECONY operates the largest steam distribution system in the United States by producing and delivering approximately 15,494 MMlb of steam annually to approximately \n1,500\n customers in parts of Manhattan.\nIn June 2025, CECONY changed its five-year forecast of the average annual peak steam demand in its service area at design conditions from a 0.4 percent decrease (for 2025 to 2029) to a 0.9 percent decrease (for 2026 to 2030). This percent change indicates increased levels of energy efficiency within the next five years along with lower customer retention for the steam system due to policy and regulations.\nO&R\nElectric\nO&R and its utility subsidiary, Rockland Electric Company (RECO) (together referred to herein as O&R) provide electric service to approxi\nmately 0.3 million\n customers in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey an approximately 1,300 square mile service area.\n54\nDuring the summer of 2025, electric peak demand in O&R's service area was 1,553 MW (which occurred on June 23, 2025). At design conditions, electric peak demand in O&R's service area would have been approximately 1,523 MW in 2025 compared to O&R's forecast of 1,605 MW.\nGas\nO&R delivers gas to o\nver 0.1 m\nillion customers in southeastern New York.\nIn June 2025, O&R increased its five-year forecast of the average annual firm peak gas demand in its service area at design conditions from a 0.1 percent decrease (for 2025 to 2029) to a 1.2 percent increase (for 2026 to 2030). This change reflects an increase in new business within the next five years.\nCertain financial data of Con Edison’s businesses are presented below: \n \n \nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\nAt September 30, 2025\n(Millions of Dollars, except percentages)\nOperating\nRevenues\nNet Income for \nCommon Stock\nOperating\nRevenues\nNet Income for \nCommon Stock\nAssets\nCECONY\n$4,181\n92\n%\n$639\n93\n%\n$11,963\n93\n%\n$1,606\n93\n%\n$66,636\n93\n%\nO&R\n349\n8\n41\n6\n959\n7\n94\n5\n4,341\n5 \nTotal Utilities\n$4,530\n100\n%\n$680\n99\n%\n$12,922\n100\n%\n$1,700\n98\n%\n$70,977\n98\n%\nCon Edison Transmission\n1\n—\n11\n1\n3\n—\n31\n2\n505\n1 \nOther (a)\n(1)\n—\n(3)\n— \n(1)\n—\n(5)\n—\n362\n1 \nTotal Con Edison\n$4,530\n100\n%\n$688\n100\n%\n$12,924\n100\n%\n$1,726\n100\n%\n$71,844\n100\n%\n(a)\nOther includes \nthe parent company, \nCon Edison’s tax equity investments, consolidation adjustments and Broken Bow II, the deferred project that was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2024, with the sale and transfer completed in January 2025. See Note Q to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was signed into law, containing a broad range of tax reform provisions, including extending and modifying certain key provisions of the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as enacted on December 22, 2017 (TCJA) and expanding certain incentives under the federal Inflation Reduction Act, as enacted on August 16, 2022 (IRA) while accelerating the phase-out of solar and wind credits. The Companies are assessing the potential impacts of the OBBBA and any such assessments may be impacted by future guidance to be issued by the Department of Treasury. However, based on management’s preliminary assessment, the provisions in the OBBBA are not expected to have a material impact on the Companies’ financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  \nInflation Reduction Act\nOn August 16, 2022, \nthe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law and implemented a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) that imposes a 15 percent tax on modified GAAP net income. Pursuant to the IRA, corporations are entitled to a tax credit (minimum tax credit) to the extent the CAMT liability exceeds the regular tax liability. This amount can be carried forward indefinitely and used in future years when regular tax liability exceeds the CAMT liability.\n \nBeginning in 2024, based on the existing statute, the Companies are subject to and report the CAMT in their Consolidated Income Statements, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2025 and 2024, Con Edison accrued a CAMT liability of $66 million ($89 million for CECONY) and $73 million ($64 million for CECONY), respectively, before the application of general business credits, with an offsetting deferred tax asset representing the minimum tax credit carryforward. The deferred tax asset related to the minimum tax credit carryforward will be realized to the extent the Companies’ consolidated deferred tax liabilities exceed the minimum tax credit carryforward. The Companies’ deferred tax liabilities are expected to exceed the minimum tax credit carryforward for the foreseeable future and thus no valuation allowance is required. The Companies are continuing to assess the impacts of the IRA on their financial statements and will update estimates based on future guidance to be issued by the Department of the Treasury. \nNew York Legislation\n55\nIn May 2025, New York adopted the 2025-2026 budget bill into law that included increases in payroll tax rates from 0.6 percent to 0.895 percent for CECONY and from 0.34 percent to 0.635 percent for O&R, effective July 1, 2025.\nIn April 2021, New York passed a law that increased the corporate franchise tax rate on business income from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent, retroactive to January 1, 2021, for taxpayers with taxable income greater than $5 million. The law also reinstated the business capital tax at 0.1875 percent, not to exceed a maximum tax liability of $5 million per taxpayer. New York requires a corporate franchise taxpayer to calculate and pay the highest amount of tax under the three alternative methods: a tax on business income; a tax on business capital; or a fixed dollar minimum. The provisions to increase the corporate franchise tax rate and reinstate a capital tax were scheduled to expire after 2023. In May 2023, New York passed a law that extended the increase in the corporate franchise tax rate from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent for an additional three years, through tax year 2026 and extended the business capital tax through tax year 2026. New York also passed a law establishing a permanent rate of 30 percent for the metropolitan transportation business tax surcharge. Con Edison does not expect to be subject to the higher tax rate of 7.25 percent in 2025.\nResults of Operations\nNet income for common stock and earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were as follows:\n  \nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(Millions of Dollars, except per share amounts)\nNet Income for Common Stock\nEarnings\nper Share\nNet Income for Common Stock\nEarnings\nper Share\nCECONY\n$639\n$537\n$1.77\n$1.55\n$1,606\n$1,417\n$4.51\n$4.10\nO&R\n41\n42\n0.11\n0.12\n94\n82\n0.26\n0.24\nCon Edison Transmission (a)\n11\n11\n0.04\n0.03\n31\n35\n0.09\n0.10\nOther (b)\n(3)\n(2)\n(0.01)\n—\n(5)\n(24)\n(0.02)\n(0.07)\nCon Edison (c)\n$688\n$588\n$1.91\n$1.70\n$1,726\n$1,510\n$4.84\n$4.37\n(a)\nNet income for common stock and earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 includes $2 million or $0.01 a share (after-tax) and $7 million or $0.02 a share (after-tax) for accretion of the basis difference of Con Edison's equity investment in MVP.

period primarily due to increase in steam revenues under the company's steam rate plan ($43 million), higher fuel expenses ($38 million) and higher purchased power expenses ($8 million). \nPurchased power\n expenses increased\n $8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared with the 2024 period due to higher unit costs ($25 million), offset in part by lower purchased volumes ($17 million). \nFuel\n expenses\n increased $38 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared with the 2024 period due to higher unit costs ($52 million), offset in part by lower purchased volumes from CECONY’s steam generating facilities ($14 million).\nOther operations and maintenance\n expenses increased $12 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared with the 2024 period primarily due to higher steam operations maintenance activities ($9 million), an increase in municipal infrastructure support ($5 million) and higher costs for pension and other postretirement benefits, reflecting reconciliation to the rate plan level ($4 million), offset in part by the impact of the May 2024 NYSPSC order denying CECONY's request to capitalize costs to implement its new

Increases in aged accounts receivable balances, inflationary pressure and higher interest rates have increased the amount of capital needed by the Utilities and the costs of such capital. See \"Interest Rate Risk,\" below, \"Aged Accounts Receivable Balances,\" above and \"Capital Resources,\" below.\nCon Edison and the Utilities have a $2,500 million revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) in place under which banks are committed to provide loans on a revolving credit basis until March 2029, unless extended for an additional one-year term, subject to certain conditions. CECONY has a $500 million 364-day revolving credit agreement (the CECONY Credit Agreement) in place under which banks are committed to provide loans on a revolving credit basis until March 2026, subject to certain conditions. Con Edison and the Utilities have not entered into any loans under the Credit Agreement and CECONY has not entered into any loans under the CECONY Credit Agreement. See Note D to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.\nIn November 2024 and January 2025, CECONY borrowed $500 million and $200 million, respectively, at a variable rate under a 364-Day Senior Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement entered into by the company in November 2024 (the CECONY Term Loan Credit Agreement). The term loans mature in November 2025. CECONY has the option to prepay the term loans issued under the CECONY Term Loan Credit Agreement prior to maturity. \nThe FERC has authorized CECONY through April 30, 2026 and O&R through July 31, 2026 to issue short-term borrowings for a period of not more than 12 months, in an amount not to exceed $4,000 million and $250 million, respectively, at prevailing market rates.\nThe Companies’ liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statements of cash flows and as discussed below.\n74\nThe Companies’ cash, temporary cash investments and restricted cash resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are summarized as follows:\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n  \nCECONY\nO&R\nCon Edison \nTransmission\nOther (a)(b)\nCon Edison (b)\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nOperating activities\n$3,111\n$2,087\n$204\n$121\n$33\n$13\n$(28)\n$83\n$3,320\n$2,304\nInvesting activities\n \n(3,497)\n(3,642)\n(297)\n(226)\n(36)\n(23)\n44\n2\n(3,786)\n(3,889)\nFinancing activities\n(829)\n450\n180\n121\n(5)\n(2)\n(31)\n(77)\n(685)\n492\nNet change for the period\n(1,215)\n(1,105)\n87\n16\n(8)\n(12)\n(15)\n8\n(1,151)\n(1,093)\nBalance at beginning of period\n1,254\n1,138\n38\n23\n23\n25\n18\n9\n1,333\n1,195\nBalance at end of period (c)\n$39\n$33\n$125\n$39\n$15\n$13\n$3\n$17\n$182\n$102\nLess: Balance held for sale (d)\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n9\n—\n9\nBalance at end of period excluding held for sale\n$39\n$33\n$125\n$39\n$15\n$13\n$3\n$8\n$182\n$93\n(a) Other includes the parent company, \nCon Edison’s tax equity investments, consolidation adjustments and Broken Bow II, the deferred project that was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2024, with the sale and transfer completed in January 2025\n.

See Note Q to the Third Quarter Financial Statements. \n75\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe Utilities’ cash flows from operating activities primarily reflect their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is primarily affected by factors external to the Utilities, such as customer demand, weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. Measures that promote distributed energy resources, such as distributed generation, demand reduction and energy efficiency, also affect the volume of energy sales and deliveries. \nPursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities have recovered from customers a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, as the Companies are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities at the current corporate tax rate for the temporary differences. For the Utilities, credits to their customers of the net benefits of the TCJA, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, decrease cash flows from operating activities. Pursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities also recover from customers the amount of property taxes they will pay. The payment of property taxes by the Utilities affects the timing of cash flows and increases the amount of short-term borrowings issued by the Utilities when property taxes are due and as property taxes increase, but generally does not impact net income. See Note J to the \nThird\n Quarter Financial Statements.\nIn general, the Utilities suspended service disconnections during the COVID-19 pandemic and have since resumed such activities in accordance with applicable law\n. At September 30, 2025, CECONY's and O&R's customer accounts receivables balances of $2,843 million and\n $121 mil\nlion, respectively, included aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $1,511 million and\n $28 million, respectively. A continued increase in accounts receivable balances has impacted and is expected to continue to impact the Companies' liquidity. See “Aged Accounts Receivable Balances,\n” above.\nNet income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies’ cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense, amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities and accrued unbilled revenue. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities’ New York electric and gas rate plans. \nNet cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 for Con Edison were $1,016 million higher than in the 2024 period. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison primarily reflects: \n•\nlower accounts receivable – customers, net of $333 million;\n•\na decrease in prepayments of $202 million;\n•\nan increase in other current liabilities of $147 million;\n•\na decrease in taxes receivable of $144 million;\n•\nan increase in accounts payable of $71 million; and\n•\nlower net deferred charges, noncurrent assets, leases, net and other regulatory assets balances of $69 million.\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 for CECONY were $1,024 million higher than in the 2024 period. The change in net cash flows for CECONY primarily reflects: \n•\na decrease in accounts receivable from (to) affiliated companies of $656 million;\n•\nlower accounts receivable – customers, net of $325 million; and\n•\nan increase in accounts payable $92 million;\nOffset in part by\n•\nlower net deferred credits, noncurrent liabilities, leases, and other regulatory liabilities balances of ($30 million). \n76\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nThe following table summarizes key components of Con Edison’s investing cash flows.\n  \nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2025\n2024\nVariance\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES\nUtility capital expenditures\n$(3,460)\n$(3,533)\n$73\nCost of removal less salvage\n(335)\n(335)\n—\nProceeds from sale of Broken Bow II, net of cash and cash equivalents sold\n45\n—\n45\nOther investing activities\n(36)\n(21)\n(15)\nNET CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n$(3,786)\n$(3,889)\n$103\nNet cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison were $103 million lower for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared with the 2024 period.

In October 2025, NY Transco entered into a settlement agreement, subject to approval by the FERC, that increases the base return on equity for TOTS from 9.50 percent to 9.99 percent and the common equity ratio used for ratemaking purposes from 53 percent to 54 percent, retroactive to March 12, 2025. \n(b)\nThe NYES project was constructed to relieve transmission congestion between upstate and downstate (estimated cost of approximately $800 million). In June 2024, construction of the Dover Station, an additional network upgrade to support the NYES project, resumed following the reissuance of its permits and is anticipated to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2025. The effective total ROE includes a 0.03 percent decrease as a result of cost sharing provisions. In October 2025, NY Transco entered into a settlement agreement, subject to approval by the FERC, that increases the base return on equity for the NYES project from 9.65 percent to 9.99 percent and the common equity ratio used for ratemaking purposes from 53 percent to 54 percent, retroactive to March 12, 2025. \n(c)\nPropel NY Energy, \na project that is under development jointly with the NYPA, is a 90-mile electric transmission project that is expected to increase high voltage transmission connections between Long Island and the rest of New York State. New York Transco’s share of the estimated cost of the Propel NY Energy project is $2,200 million, excluding interconnection costs and the cost of projects expected to be built by local transmission owners, including CECONY. The siting, construction and operation of the project will require approvals and permits from the appropriate governmental agencies and authorities, including the NYSPSC. The FERC also authorized the project to receive an abandoned plant incentive if the project is cancelled or abandoned for reasons beyond Propel NY Energy’s control and to recover construction work in progress in rate base during the development and construction phase of the project.  \nCon Edison Transmission owns an interest of approximately 71.2 percent in Honeoye, a company that operates a gas storage facility in upstate New York and in which CECONY owns the remaining interest. Con Edison Transmission and CECONY are considering strategic alternatives with respect to their investments in Honeoye.\nCon Edison Transmission owns an interest of approximately 6.6 percent in MVP as of September 30, 20\n25. M\nVP is a joint venture among five partners, including Con Edison Transmission, that constructed and operates the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a 303-mile gas transmission project in West Virginia and Virginia that entered service in June 2024. \nIn October 2025, the operator of the Mountain Valley Pipeline filed a petition with the FERC for approval of the expansion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline Mainline System (MVP Boost), a project expected to increase the capacity of the pipeline by 600 MDth/d by adding compression at three existing compressor stations in West Virginia and constructing a new compressor station in Virginia. MVP Boost is estimated to cost $468.4 million, with Con Edison Transmission’s 6.6 percent ownership interest estimated to be $31 million. \nCon Edison Transmission is considering strategic alternatives with respect to its investment in MVP.\nIn June 2024, construction of the Dover Station, an additional network upgrade to support the NYES project, resumed following the reissuance of its permits and is anticipated to be comple\nted during the fourth quarter of 2025. \nEnvironmental Matters\nClean Energy Future\nIn September 2025, the NYSPSC issued an order adopting a proactive planning framework for upgraded electric grid infrastructure for New York utilities, including CECONY and O&R. The order sets forth a framework to annually identify upgrades necessary to support building and transportation electrification, as well as distributed energy resources (DER). Although DER, including energy storage, has the ability to reduce load on the system, increased deployment of bidirectional DER may lead to DER hotspots that trigger system upgrades. The order directs New York utilities to incorporate both existing and forecasted quantities of DER into the load forecasts utilized in the proactive planning framework. The order also requires New York utilities to, among other things, file: a methodology document detailing areas of agreement and divergence in how they conduct load studies; a report that includes the next portfolio of proposed urgent projects; and an annual report explaining how load studies developed for proactive planning are integrated in the coordinated grid planning process cycles, sales forecasts, gas planning, and future rate cases. \n81\nIn August 2025, the NYSPSC issued an order denying NYPA’s petition to designate the Clean Path New York transmission proposal as a priority transmission project under the Accelerated Renewables Act.\n \nThe project was proposed to bring renewable energy to New York City by interconnecting to CECONY’s high-voltage transmission system.\nIn July 2025, the FERC granted CECONY’s request for the abandoned plant and construction work in progress (CWIP) incentives for certain breakers at the Rainey substation in Queens, New York that CECONY has been designated to construct as part of the Propel NY Energy project that is being developed by NYPA and New York Transco, effective July 14, 2025. See “Con Edison Transmission,” above. CECONY will recover all of its prudently incurred costs associated with the breakers if the installation is cancelled or abandoned for reasons beyond CECONY’s control and CECONY will recover all of the CWIP incentive in rate base during the development and construction phase of the breakers. \nIn June 2025, the NYSPSC approved five of the nine urgent proactive planning projects proposed by CECONY in its November 2024 filing for grid upgrades needed to meet anticipated demand from transportation and building heating electrification. The total estimated capital costs for the five new urgent projects are $439.9 million. The NYSPSC indicated that the remaining urgent projects not approved may be pursued as part of a rate case, through the proactive planning framework study process discussed above, or through another relevant generic proceeding. All nine proposed projects were included in the CECONY 2025 rate filing.\nIn May 2025, CECONY and O&R submitted the annual update to their combined gas system long-term plan (GSLTP) that was filed in November 2023. In addition to the annual updates, the filing contained a system planning update with details on potential long-term impacts to revenue requirements, load forecasts, program changes, data on actual customer usage, a framework for scaling back the Utilities’ long-term contracts for natural gas supply, updates on disadvantaged communities and development of a definition of “hard-to-electrify customers.” The Utilities are required to periodically file these long-term plans and the next iteration of the GSLTP is due in August 2027.\nOffshore Wind\nIn July 2025, the NYSPSC issued an order withdrawing the PPTN process given actions taken by the federal government that reduced the prospects for the construction of the offshore wind resources that were anticipated to be served by the proposed transmission solutions. The NYSPSC’s decision does not, however, affect previously permitted offshore wind projects in New York, including Sunrise Wind (924 MW), a project that began construction in June 2024 and is expected to enter commercial operation in 2026 and Empire Wind 1 (810 MW), a project that is expected to enter commercial operation in 2027 and connect to the New York City electrical grid at CECONY’s Gowanus substation.\nIn May 2025, construction of relevant marine activities associated with the Empire Wind 1 offshore wind project (810 MW) resumed after a suspension that began in April 2025 in compliance with a stop work order issued by the United States Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. See \"Federal Regulation,\" above.\nEnergy Efficiency and Building Electrification\nIn May 2025, the NYSPSC issued two orders that established budgets for CECONY’s and O&R’s energy efficiency and building electrification programs (formerly known as New Efficiency New York) for 2026-2030 with aggregate budgets of approximately $2,140 million and $110 million, respectively. The aggregate amounts are comprised of average annual budgets of: $300 million and $19 million for electric energy efficiency and heat pump programs for CECONY and O&R, respectively, and $128 million and $3 million for gas energy efficiency programs for CECONY and O&R, respectively. Energy efficiency and building electrification expenditures are treated as regulatory assets with recovery including the weighted average cost of capital and beginning in 2026 via a surcharge rather than included in base rates.\nThermal Energy Networks\nIn July 2025, CECONY and O&R filed with the NYSPSC their final Pilot Engineering Design and Customer Protection Plans (Stage 2 Filings) for the utility-scale thermal energy network (UTEN) pilot project. CECONY and O&R requested authorization to proceed to Stage 3 (Customer Enrollment and Construction). The total estimated costs for the UTEN projects have increased to $415 million (from $255 million) and $112 million (from $46 million) for CECONY and O&R, respectively. CECONY and O&R were previously authorized to incur costs of $23.1 million \n82\nand $4.6 million, respectively. The remaining proposed budget amounts in excess of the previously authorized amounts are subject to approval by the NYSPSC. \nEnergy Affordability\nIn July 2025, the NYSPSC issued an order adopting an enhanced energy affordability policy, which will expand eligibility for New York utilities’ Energy Affordability Programs (EAP). These changes are expected to take effect in 2026. In an effort to address growing affordability concerns, the 2023-24 New York State budget tasked the NYSPSC with developing a discount program for residential electric and gas customers who do not qualify for the existing EAP but whose income is below the state or area median income to help additional households with energy bills. The order establishes three additional benefit tiers in a new Enhanced EAP (EEAP) alongside the current EAP and increases the total budget for these programs from 2 percent to 3 percent of each New York utility’s total annual revenue, with 0.5 percent set aside for the three new EEAP. The Utilities are required, among other things, to file cost recovery plans detailing the cost to implement the program, update EAP budgets accordingly, and track enrollment and participation in the EEAP over an initial two-year pilot period.\nElectric Reliability Needs\nCECONY and O&R monitor the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in their service areas and work with other parties on long-term resource adequacy and transmission security within the framework of the NYISO reliability planning process. In October 2025, the NYISO issued its 2025 Q3 Short-Term Assessment of Reliability (STAR) that identifies a bulk power system electric reliability need in New York City beginning in the summer of 2026 and continuing through 2030. The need is primarily driven by forecasted increases in peak demand, deactivation notices of existing generation on the Gowanus and Narrows barges\n and uncertainty as to whether or not \ncertain planned projects are completed and energized within the forecasted time period (the Gowanus-Greenwood 345-138 kV feeder and the Champlain Hudson Power Express in May 2026, Empire Wind in July 2027 and Propel NY in May 2030). The NYISO is expected to issue a solicitation for both market-based and regulated solutions. CECONY, as the Responsible Transmission Owner, would propose a regulated backstop solution. \nFinancial and Commodity Market Risks\nThe Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and investment risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Companies' interest rate risk primarily relates to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the capital expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities, and variable-rate debt. Con Edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at September 30, 2025, \na 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expen\nse of $7 million and $6 million, respectively.\n Un\nder CECONY’s current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense, including costs associated with the refinancing of the variable rate tax-exempt debt, are reconciled to levels reflected in rates. \nHigher interest rates have resulted in increased interest expense on commercial paper, variable-rate debt and long-term debt issuances.\nCommodity Price Risk\nCon Edison’s commodity price risk primarily relates to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note N to the Third Quarter Financial Statements.\nCon Edison estimates that, as of September 30, 2025, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $162 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $148 million is for CECONY and $14 million is for O&R. As of September 30, 2024, Con Edison estimated that a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $148 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $136 million is for CECONY and $12 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased.\n83\nThe Utilities do not make any margin or profit on the electricity or gas they sell. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from full-service customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for those customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. However, increases in electric and gas commodity prices may contribute to a slower recovery of cash from outstanding customer accounts receivable balances. See “Electric Supply” and “Aged Accounts Receivable Balances,” above.\nInvestment Risk\nThe Companies’ investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Con Edison's investment risk also relates to the investments of Con Edison Transmission that are accounted for under the equity method. See \"Investments\" in Note A to the Third Quarter Financial Statements. \nThe Companies’ current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 26 to 30 percent equity securities, 42 to 60 percent debt securities and 14 to 30 percent alternatives. At September 30, 2025, the pension plan investments consisted of 27 percent equity securities, 50 percent debt securities and 23 percent alternatives.\nFor the Utilities’ pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. In accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between the pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. O&R also defers such difference pursuant to its New York rate plans.\nMaterial Contingencies\nFor information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies’ material contingencies, see \"Other Regulatory Matters\" in Note B and Notes G and H to the Third Quarter Financial Statements."
