Our strategic segments - Intelligent Operating Solutions, Precision Technologies, and Advanced Healthcare Solutions - include well-known brands with leading positions in their markets. Our businesses design, develop, manufacture, and service professional and engineered products, software, and services, building upon leading brand names, innovative technologies, and significant market positions. We are headquartered in Everett, Washington and have a workforce of more than 18,000 research and development, manufacturing, sales, distribution, service, and administrative professionals in more than 50 countries around the world.\nOn September 4, 2024, we announced our intention to separate our Precision Technologies segment business into an independent publicly-traded company (the “Separation”), which will be named Ralliant. The Separation will create (i) a technology solutions company, retaining the Fortive name, with a portfolio of the brands currently operating under Fortive’s Intelligent Operating Solutions and Advanced Healthcare Solutions business segments, focused on resilient, high-quality recurring growth by delivering productivity and safety to customers, and (ii) a global technology company consisting of our brands currently operating under the Precision Technologies segment with a focus on precision instruments and highly engineered products essential for breakthrough innovation and aligned to powerful secular trends. The Separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free spin-off for Fortive shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is targeting completion of the Separation early in the third quarter of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, final approval of Fortive’s Board of Directors, satisfactory completion of financing, receipt of a favorable opinion of legal counsel and/or a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service with respect to the tax treatment of \n4\nTable \nof\n Contents\nthe transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement filed with the SEC, and other regulatory approvals. \nFortive Corporation is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 2015 in connection with the separation of Fortive from Danaher Corporation (“Danaher” or “Former Parent”) on July 2, 2016 as an independent, publicly-traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nIn this Annual Report, the terms “Fortive” or the “Company” refer to either Fortive Corporation or to Fortive Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.

Prices of oil and gas affect our costs for freight and utilities. We purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world. Tariffs affect our costs for impacted materials or components we import into the United States. Based on allocation of annual spend among our various suppliers, no single supplier is material. However, some components that require particular specifications or qualifications are dependent on a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components. We utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain, including in certain cases the use of safety stock, alternative materials that meet the quality and regulatory requirements, and qualification of multiple supply sources. While the remediation efforts taken by certain jurisdictions in response to events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruptions from the Ukraine/Russia conflict, have raised material and shipping costs, our supply chain was responsive to these dynamics, and we implemented solutions, including through FBS and working collaboratively with our suppliers, to effectively support our operations, and help countermeasure production material shortages and distribution limitations. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\n6\nTable \nof\n Contents\nIntellectual Property\n \nWe own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets and hold licenses to use intellectual property owned by others. Although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations, we do not consider any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, or license to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time, we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights. For a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” All capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, Fortive.\nCompetition \nWe believe that we are a leader in many of our served markets. Although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment, since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales, marketing, research, and financial capabilities, as well as well-established regional competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets. We face increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of competitors based in low-cost manufacturing locations, and increasing consolidation in particular markets. The number of competitors varies by product and service line. Our management believes that we have a market leadership position in most of the markets we serve. Key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product and service lines, but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price, quality, performance, delivery speed, applications expertise, distribution channel access, service and support, technology and innovation, breadth of product, service and software offerings, and brand name recognition. For a discussion of risks related to competition, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nSeasonal Nature of Business\nGeneral economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve. For example, sales of capital equipment and sterilization consumables are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and sales to OEMs are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality.\nHuman Capital Management\nFortive is a global team, over 18,000 strong, energized by a powerful purpose. Our people strategy centers on empowering inclusive teams working together to solve problems no one could solve alone. We intentionally seek out different skills, backgrounds, and voices to deliver results for our customers and fulfill our employee promise – For you. For us. For growth. Our people strategy is defined by this inclusive growth culture and is advanced through FBS and our career development and reward systems. We continually measure, review, and refine our people strategy through measured employee experience processes. These key elements enable us to accelerate progress for our customers, our teams, and the world.\nInclusive Growth Culture\nWe are more together. Our inclusive growth culture sets the tone for Fortive’s people strategy and drives Fortive’s success. \nWe know that a workforce empowered by inclusivity, continuous improvement, and FBS creates extraordinary long-term value for our customers, people and shareholders. We are focused on cultivating an inclusive workplace where everyone can contribute to their fullest potential, attracting and retaining top talent from a wide variety of candidate sources, and sustaining policies and practices to ensure that no group is inadvertently disadvantaged. Fortive is committed to adhering to EEO (equal employment opportunity) principles. All people are evaluated through a neutral merit-based process. We do not consider race, ethnicity, gender, or any other protected trait in our hiring, promotional, or other processes. \nOur Board of Directors, along with the Compensation Committee, also oversee our inclusive growth culture practices as an integral part of our people strategy and measurement actions. \nWe are committed to continued transparency by publicly sharing our workforce representation and inclusion results through our website (where we provide our EEO-1 report), and our annual Sustainability Report. \n7\nTable \nof\n Contents\nBusiness, Career Development, and Reward Systems \nOur culture of continuous improvement inspires us to keep experimenting, growing, and learning. Our career development and reward systems advance our people strategy by attracting, growing, and retaining the exceptional people we need now and in the future. These business and career development systems strengthen our ability to deliver our employee value proposition, build our employer brand, drive professional growth for our people and results for our customers.\nOur Performance and Development processes drive results and career growth for our global teams. Performance for Growth rigorously deploys our strategies into cascaded goals throughout the organization, while Development for Growth translates our beliefs and values into desired leader competencies, at all levels of the organization. Together, these provide a roadmap for the way we work, deliver results, and build high-performing teams. \nAdditionally, we design our Total Rewards programs to attract and retain talented, curious people with a growth mindset and a passion for innovation, collaboration, and continuous improvement. We offer leading programs that inspire and reward superior performance, are equitable, and foster an inclusive, diverse, and healthy global workforce.\nWe also invest in our people at every level through our growth and development experiences. These experiences range from leadership learning and FBS immersion to hands-on skill building in each of our three FBS pillars—growth, lean, and leadership. Collectively, these experiences build skills, strengthen performance, and prepare our people for challenging opportunities and outsized impact.\nWith our strong and evolving portfolio, our people have the opportunity to accelerate their career across multiple industries, meaningfully contributing to customer success and impact in the world.\nEmployee Experience and Feedback\nOur promise to employees is ‒ For you. For us. For growth. To achieve this promise, our leaders at all levels of the organization actively seek feedback with quarterly touchpoints to strengthen our inclusive growth culture. \nIn our last comprehensive census survey in Q4 2024, over 85% of our global team responded, delivering continued strength in overall engagement and inclusion and belonging at high ratings of 76% and 84%, respectively. Our results continue to inform both management and our Board of Directors on appropriate actions to enhance our culture and overall employee experience. \nGovernment Contracts\nAlthough the majority of our revenue in 2024 was from customers other than governmental entities, each of our segments has agreements relating to the sale of products and services to government entities. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments and government-owned entities. For a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nRegulatory Matters\nWe face extensive government regulation both within and outside the United States relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale, and distribution of our products, software, and services. The following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. For a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nMedical Device Regulations\nMany of our products in the Advanced Healthcare Solutions segment are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars, and orders, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”). The FDCA requires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping for such products.  \nMedical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture, or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance and payment of an FDA user fee. \n8\nTable \nof\n Contents\nMarket access, sales, and marketing of medical devices in non-U.S. countries are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. For example in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), a medical device must meet the Medical Devices Directive’s (“MDD”) Essential Requirements or, for new devices placed on the market after May 26, 2021, the Medical Devices Regulation’s (“MDR”) General Safety and Performance Requirements as well as other requirements set out in the MDD/MDR, depending on the device’s risk class. Before placing a medical device on the EEA market, the manufacturer must prepare a declaration of conformity, certifying that the device complies with the MDD/MDR, and must then affix the CE mark. The notified body typically audits and examines the device’s technical documentation, and the quality system for the manufacture, design, and final inspection of the relevant device before issuing a CE certificate. Following the issuance of this CE certificate, manufacturers may prepare the declaration of conformity and affix the CE mark to the devices covered by this CE certificate. Similar requirements apply in the UK. For access to the UK market, manufacturers must obtain a UKCA Certificate and affix a UKCA mark to their medical devices. \nAny medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state and certain other comparable foreign authorities. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA and other comparable foreign authorities as well as audits by our notified body. We are required to adhere to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices requirements, as set forth in the Quality Systems Regulation, as well as other applicable standards which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process.\nWe must also comply with global post-market surveillance regulations, including adverse event reporting requirements, which require that we review and report to the FDA and other comparable foreign authorities any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.\nLabeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and other comparable foreign authorities and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission and other comparable foreign regulators. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA, foreign regulators, or our notified body may not be promoted for undocumented, unapproved, or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA, other U.S. agencies, and other comparable foreign authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.\nOther Healthcare Laws\nWe are subject to various healthcare related laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices, and the privacy and security of health information. In particular, the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration (including any kickback or bribe), directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Similar laws and regulations apply in many foreign countries.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) prohibits knowingly and willfully (1) executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, or (2) falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, also restricts the use and disclosure of patient identifiable health information, mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient identifiable health information, and requires the reporting of certain security breaches with respect to such information. Similar to the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Similar laws and regulations apply in many foreign countries.\nThe False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program, knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly makes a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Similar laws and regulations apply in many foreign countries.\n9\nTable \nof\n Contents\nFederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. Analogous U.S. state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, also may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements, and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers. Further, there are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to comply with the voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. Similar laws and regulations apply in many non-U.S. countries.\nAnti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws\nGiven the international scope of operation, we are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. laws outlawing bribes, kickbacks, payoffs, and other improper payments. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the UK Bribery Act, and other similar laws in other jurisdictions prohibit companies, their officers and employees, and their intermediaries from making improper payments to public officials to influence those officials or secure an improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. In the past several years, there has been a substantial increase in the enforcement of these global anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Our operations throughout the world, including in developing countries with heightened risks of corruption, and interactions with individuals who are considered public officials under these laws, such as healthcare professionals in countries with state-run healthcare systems, expose us to the risk of violating these laws. Violations of these laws or even allegations of violations of these laws could pose reputational risks, subject us to investigations and related litigation, cause disruptions to our business, and result in monetary fines and damages and other sanctions.\nData Privacy and Security Laws\nAs a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. \nData privacy and security laws are rapidly evolving. In particular, a broad privacy law in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which came into effect in January 2020 and was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act effective January 2023, has some of the same features as the GDPR (discussed below) and has prompted several other states to enact or consider similar legislation.\nAcross the European Economic Area, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and similar laws in the United Kingdom and Switzerland impose strict requirements on how we process personal data, including, among other things, in certain circumstances a requirement for prompt notification of data breaches to supervisory authorities and/or to data subjects, with the risk of significant fines for non-compliance. Regulators throughout Europe also require additional safeguards to facilitate the transfer of personal information outside of Europe.\nSeveral other countries, such as China, Russia, and Brazil, have passed, and other countries are considering passing, laws that meaningfully expand the compliance requirements around confidential, personal, and/or sensitive data that we may have access to or process in the course of our business. In China and Russia, privacy and security laws may require a copy of personal data relating to citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (“LGPD”) increases compliance requirements related to privacy, data protection, and information security for businesses that are located or do business within Brazil. Although the LGPD shares similarities with the GDPR, it also contains a number of unique features, including specific legal bases not found in the GDPR that allow an organization to process personal data and specific requirements for the role or appointment of a data protection officer. In these countries and elsewhere, the laws applicable to data privacy and security may require changes to business practices or additional investment for compliance purposes.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nOur operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management, and workplace health and safety. For a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that our operations, products, and services are subject to and other environmental contingencies, please refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. For a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and risks related to past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\n10\nTable \nof\n Contents\nExport/Import Regulations\nWe sell products and services to customers all over the world and are required to comply with various U.S. export/import control and economic sanctions laws, such as:\n•\nthe International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which, among other things, impose license requirements on the export from the United States of defense articles and defense services listed on the United States Munitions List;\n•\nthe Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, which, among other things, impose licensing requirements on the export, in-country transfer, and re-export of certain dual-use goods, technology, and software (which are items that have both commercial and military or proliferation applications);\n•\nthe regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries, governments, and persons based on United States foreign policy and national security considerations; and\n•\nthe import regulations administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\nOther nations’ governments have implemented similar export/import control and economic sanction regulations, which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions. Together these controls and regulations may impose licensing requirements on exports of certain technology and software from the U.S. and may impact our ability to transact business in certain countries or with certain customers. We have developed compliance programs and training to prevent violations of these programs and regulations, and we regularly monitor changes in the law and regulations. Changes in these or other import or export laws and regulations may restrict or further restrict our ability to sell certain products and solutions and may require us to develop additional compliance programs and training. For a discussion of risks related to export/import control and economic sanctions laws, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nCompetition Laws\nOur global operations are subject to complex and changing antitrust and competition laws and regulations, including conflicting laws and regulations in different jurisdictions that have increased the cost of conducting our global operations. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable global laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance of complete and consistent compliance with all laws and regulations given the complex and evolving policies implemented by governments around the world. If we are found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhistleblower Laws\nWe operate in jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and European Union, with significant legal protection compliance for whistleblowers who make compliance reports about potential violations internally and to government authorities. Non-compliance with the Whistleblower Directive can result in fines and other penalties against entities. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice can provide monetary awards to whistleblowers that report securities law violations that are subsequently pursued. U.S. laws, such as the False Claims Act, also include strong financial incentives for whistleblowers to bring lawsuits against companies with healthcare products and services such as Fortive. In addition, the False Claims Act permits whistleblowers to bring a lawsuit on behalf of the government and share in any monetary recovery, even if the government decides not to intervene in the case. \nInternational Operations\nOur products and services are available in markets worldwide, and our principal markets outside the United States are in Europe and Asia. We also have operations around the world, and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce, provides greater stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies, and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products. In addition, we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target high-growth markets.\nThe manner in which our products and services are sold outside the United States differs by business and by region. Most of our sales in non-U.S. markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the United States, though we also sell directly from the United States into non-U.S. markets through various representatives and distributors and, in some cases, directly. In countries with low sales volumes, we generally sell through representatives and distributors.\n11\nTable \nof\n Contents\nAvailable Information\nWe maintain an internet website at www.fortive.com where we make available free of charge our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such material to, the SEC.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of Fortive’s financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024.\nFortive is a provider of essential technologies for connected workflow solutions across a range of attractive end-markets. Our strategic segments - Intelligent Operating Solutions (“IOS”), Precision Technologies (“PT”), and Advanced Healthcare Solutions (“AHS”) - include well-known brands with leading positions in their markets. Our businesses design, develop, \n29\nTable \nof\n Contents\nmanufacture, and service professional and engineered products, software, and services, building upon leading brand names, innovative technologies, and significant market positions. We are headquartered in Everett, Washington and have a workforce of more than 18,000 research and development, manufacturing, sales, distribution, service, and administrative professionals in more than 50 countries around the world.\nThis MD&A is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. Our MD&A is divided into seven sections:\n•\nBasis of Presentation \n•\nOverview\n•\nResults of Operations\n•\nFinancial Instruments and Risk Management\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n•\nNew Accounting Standards\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nFortive is a multinational business with global operations with approximately 46% of our sales derived from customers outside the United States in 2024. As a company with global operations, our businesses are affected by worldwide, regional, and industry-specific economic, regulatory, and political factors. Our geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of products, software, and services we offer, typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country (except for the United States) on our operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured, software and services provided, and geographies served, we do not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. Our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including their sales, to the extent possible, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.\nAs a result of our geographic and industry diversity, we face a variety of opportunities and challenges, including technological development in most of the markets we serve, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, and consolidation of our competitors. We define high-growth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing extended periods of accelerated growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure which include Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia with the exception of Japan and Australia. We operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and our long-term growth and profitability will depend, in particular, on our ability to expand our business across geographies and market segments, identify, consummate, and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products, services, and software, expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, attract relevant talent and retain, grow, and empower our talented workforce, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. We are making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address technological change in the markets we serve and to improve our manufacturing, research and development, and customer-facing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn this report, references to sales from existing businesses (“core revenue”) refer to sales from operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding (1) the impact from acquired and divested businesses and (2) the impact of foreign currency translation. References to sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition, less the amount of sales attributable to certain businesses or product lines that have been divested, or, at the time of reporting, are pending divestiture, but are not, and will not be, considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture. The portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales impact from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales impact from acquired businesses) after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year \n30\nTable \nof\n Contents\nperiod. Core revenue should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nManagement believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of core revenue provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of acquisition and divestiture related items because the nature, size, and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation from core revenue because the impact of currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility. Management believes the exclusion of the effect of acquisitions and divestitures and currency translation may facilitate the assessment of underlying business trends and may assist in comparisons of long-term performance. References to sales volume from existing businesses refer to the impact of both price and unit sales.\nUpdate on Pending Separation of the Precision Technologies Segment\nOn September 4, 2024, we announced our intention to separate our PT segment business into an independent publicly-traded company (the “Separation”), which will be named Ralliant. The Separation will create (i) a technology solutions company, retaining the Fortive name, with a portfolio of the brands currently operating under Fortive’s IOS and AHS business segments, focused on resilient, high-quality recurring growth by delivering productivity and safety to customers, and (ii) a global technology company consisting of our brands currently operating under the PT segment with a focus on precision instruments and highly engineered products essential for breakthrough innovation and aligned to powerful secular trends. The Separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free spin-off for Fortive shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is targeting completion of the Separation early in the third quarter of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, final approval of Fortive’s Board of Directors, satisfactory completion of financing, receipt of a favorable opinion of legal counsel and/or a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service with respect to the tax treatment of the transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement filed with the SEC, and other regulatory approvals. All assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of Ralliant are included in the consolidated results of the Company in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nSegment Realignment and Divestiture\nIn January 2024, we realigned Invetech from the AHS segment to the PT segment (the “Segment Realignment”) based on our strategic decision to divest the equipment design and manufacturing businesses of Invetech, while retaining the motion solution businesses (the “Motion Solution Business”) that are more closely aligned with the PT segment than the AHS segment. In June 2024, we divested and transferred ownership of Invetech, excluding the Motion Solution Business, to its management team (the “Invetech Divestiture”). As a result of the divestiture, in the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a net realized loss of $25.6 million, which is identified as “Loss from divestiture” in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The divested businesses accounted for less than 1.0% of total revenue and less than 1.0% of total assets for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The Invetech Divestiture did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results, and therefore the divested businesses are not reported as discontinued operations.\nAcquisitions \nOn January 3, 2024, we acquired EA Elektro-Automatik Holding GmbH (“EA”), a leading supplier of high-power electronic test solutions for energy storage, mobility, hydrogen, and renewable energy applications. The acquisition of EA will bolster the PT segment’s innovative portfolio of products and services for engineers with complementary test and measurement solutions enabling the global energy transition. The total consideration paid was approximately $1.72 billion, net of acquired cash. We recorded approximately $1.18 billion of goodwill within our PT segment related to the EA acquisition, which is not tax deductible. We also anticipate future tax benefits as a result of the transaction.\nOther Matters\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we initiated a discrete restructuring plan that is expected to be completed by December 31, 2025. The nature of the plan initiated in 2024 was related to the Separation and consisted primarily of targeted workforce reductions to realign the cost structures between the two companies. In the first quarter of 2023, we initiated a separate discrete restructuring plan that was completed by the end of 2023. The nature of the activities in 2023 was broadly consistent throughout our segments and consisted primarily of targeted workforce reductions in response to overall macroeconomic and other external conditions. We incurred these costs to position ourselves to provide superior products and services to customers in a cost-efficient manner, while taking into consideration the impact of broad economic uncertainties. We incurred charges of $19.7 million and $58.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n31\nTable \nof\n Contents\nBusiness Performance and Outlook\nBusiness Performance\nDuring 2024, aggregate year-over-year sales increased 2.7%, driven by a 1.3% increase in our core revenue and a 2.0% increase from acquisitions, net of divestiture, partially offset by a decline of 0.6% due to unfavorable foreign currency translation. Core revenue growth included favorable pricing of 2.7%, partially offset by volume decline of 1.4%.\nGeographically, core revenue in developed markets increased by low single-digits during 2024, driven by low single-digit growth in North America, while Western Europe decreased slightly. Core revenue in high growth markets increased slightly, driven by low double-digit growth in Latin America, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Asia, where China declined by high single-digits. \n2025 Outlook\nWe anticipate full year sales growth to be between approximately flat and 2.0% with year-over-year growth from existing businesses of approximately 1.5% and 3.5%.\nWe expect foreign exchange rates to remain volatile throughout the year, which could continue to impact our financial results. Additionally, our financial outlook is subject to various assumptions and risks, including but not limited to, ongoing geopolitical developments and events, global uncertainties related to governmental policies toward international trade, monetary and fiscal policies, including the current uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other major regions with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations, sanctions and tariffs, macroeconomic conditions in the United States, China, and other critical regions, impact from our pending separation into two independent publicly traded companies, and the impact of inflationary dynamics on our expenses or our ability to realize price increases in our sales, interest rates, market conditions in key product segments, and elective surgery rates. We will continue to deploy FBS to actively manage these challenges and utilize pricing and other countermeasures to offset the aforementioned dynamics. We continue to monitor these conditions which may continue to impact our business, as well as potential adverse global economic trends and sentiments, monetary and fiscal policies, international trade and relations between the U.S., China and other nations, and investment and taxation policy initiatives being considered in the United States and by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), including the potential impact of the Pillar Two initiative. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComponents of Sales Growth\n \n2024 vs. 2023\nTotal revenue growth (GAAP)\n2.7\n \n%\nImpact of:\nAcquisitions and divestitures\n(2.0)\n%\nCurrency exchange rates\n0.6 \n%\nCore revenue growth (Non-GAAP)\n1.3\n \n%\nOperating Profit Margins\n2024 vs. 2023\nOperating profit margins were 19.4% in 2024, an increase of 70 basis points as compared to 18.7% in 2023.

The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase in losses from equity investments of $22.1 million and a charitable contribution of $20.0 million made in the first quarter of 2024. For further discussion of these transactions, refer to Note 6 and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively. \nINCOME TAXES\nGeneral\nIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements. We record the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.\nOur effective tax rate can be affected by, among others, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities, and changes in tax laws.\nWe are subject to income, transaction and other taxes in the United States and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. Our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in business profit by jurisdiction, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. We closely monitor changes to tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, and global tax standards; and at the time of a change, the related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the quarter and year of change. Furthermore, certain tax laws are inherently ambiguous requiring subjective interpretation on the application thereof. Our interpretation and the corresponding amount of taxes we pay is, and may in the future continue to be, subject to audits by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to examination in the United States, various states and foreign jurisdiction for the tax years 2014 to 2024. These examinations include filings of tax returns prior to our separation from Danaher, tax returns of enterprises no longer in our portfolio, and tax returns for pre-acquisition periods of enterprises added to our portfolio. In addition, significant obligations are detailed in our tax matters agreements in connection with the separation of Fortive from Danaher on July 1, 2016, the split-off of the Automation and Specialty business on October 1, 2018, and the Vontier separation on October 9, 2020. We review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis, considering many factors including the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions, and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary.  \nFor a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” \nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate\n \nwas 14.1% during 2024 and 12.6% during 2023, respectively.\nOur effective tax rate for 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to the positive and negative effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), U.S. federal permanent differences, the impacts of credits and deductions provided by law, including those associated with state income taxes, a decrease in our uncertain tax positions, non-deductible transaction costs related to the Separation and the effect of changes in tax rates enacted in the current period.\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nComprehensive income decreased by $172 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to an unfavorable change in foreign currency translation adjustments of $149 million, offset by an increase in net income of $33 million and a favorable change in pension benefit adjustments of $11 million.\n37\nTable \nof\n Contents\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk and commodity prices, each of which could impact our financial statements. We generally address our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities. In addition, our broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on our operating profit as a whole.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt but not our earnings or cash flows because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2024, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt by approximately $101 million. \nAs of December 31, 2024, our variable-rate debt obligations consist of U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper and senior unsecured term facilities denominated in either Euros or Japanese Yen (refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2024). As a result, our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, we anticipate issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations and/or term loans to refinance all or part of these borrowings. The annual effective rate associated with our outstanding variable-rate obligation was approximately 4.85% with interest expense of $59 million. As of December 31, 2024, on an annualized basis, a hypothetical 10 basis points increase in market interest rates on our variable-rate debt obligations would have increased our interest expense by approximately $1.0 million in 2024. \nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe face transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside of the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of an applicable subsidiary. We also face translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars, our functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) component of equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2024 would have resulted in a reduction of foreign currency-denominated net assets and stockholders’ equity of approximately $326 million.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our outstanding €500 million Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes due 2026, €700 million Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes due 2029, ¥14.4 billion Yen-denominated variable interest rate term loan, and €275 million Euro-denominated variable interest rate term loan were designated as net investment hedges of our investment in applicable foreign operations. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the debt were deferred in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on our investments in foreign subsidiaries. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized after-tax gains of $60.4 million, losses of $1.2 million, and losses of $5.1 million within Other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedges, respectively. \nCurrency exchange rates unfavorably impacted 2024 reported sales by 0.6% as compared to 2023, as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against most major currencies during 2024 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2023. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2024 were to prevail throughout 2025, currency exchange rates would negatively impact 2025 estimated sales by approximately 1.4% relative to our performance in 2024. In general, additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would further negatively impact our sales and results of operations on an overall basis.\nWe have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. \nCredit Risk\nWe are exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist of cash and highly-liquid investment grade cash \n38\nTable \nof\n Contents\nequivalents and receivables from customers. We place cash and cash equivalents with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although we typically do not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, we regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. We emphasize safety and liquidity of principal over yield on those funds. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of our customers. Our businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate.\nCommodity Price Risk\nFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. We generate substantial cash from operating activities and believe that our operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity, which consist of available cash, our revolving credit facility, and access to commercial paper, bank loans, and capital markets, will be sufficient to allow us to continue funding and investing in our existing businesses, consummate strategic acquisitions, execute strategic separations, repurchase common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, make interest and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness, fulfill our contractual obligations, and manage our capital structure on a short and long-term basis. \nWe have generally satisfied any short-term liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flows and available cash through issuances of commercial paper under our U.S. dollar and Euro-denominated commercial paper programs (“Commercial Paper Programs”). \nCredit support for the Commercial Paper Programs is provided by a five-year $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on October 18, 2027 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) which, to the extent not otherwise providing credit support for the commercial paper programs, can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe availability of the Revolving Credit Facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the Commercial Paper Programs when we have outstanding borrowings. We expect to limit any future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow us to borrow, if needed, and repay any outstanding commercial paper as it matures. \nOur ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Any downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowing under our commercial paper programs and the Credit Agreement, and could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a downgrade, change in market conditions, or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash, operating cash flow, and the Revolving Credit Facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility could be higher than the historic cost of commercial paper borrowings.\nOn June 7, 2023, we filed with the SEC an “automatic shelf” registration statement (the “Shelf Registration Statement”). Under the Shelf Registration Statement, we may from time to time sell shares of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, purchase contracts, purchase units, warrants and subscription rights in one or more offerings. For example, in February 2024, we completed our offering of €500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.7% Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and €700 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.7% Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) under the Shelf Registration Statement. \nWe continue to monitor the financial markets, the stability of U.S and international banks and general global economic conditions. In addition, our access to the capital markets and other financing sources is impacted by any change in our credit rating. If changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy or downgrade in our credit rating adversely affect our access to the capital markets and other financing sources, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and existing available capacity under our credit facilities to provide short-term funding.\n39\nTable \nof\n Contents\nOverview of Cash Flows and Liquidity\nFollowing is an overview of our cash flows and liquidity ($ in millions):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,526.8 \n$\n1,353.6 \nCash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received\n$\n(1,721.8)\n$\n(95.8)\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment\n(120.4)\n(107.8)\nProceeds from sale of property\n61.2 \n7.4 \nCash infusion into divestiture\n(14.0)\n— \nAll other investing activities\n(1.0)\n0.8 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(1,796.0)\n$\n(195.4)\nNet proceeds from (repayments of) commercial paper borrowings\n$\n(596.5)\n$\n839.9 \nProceeds from borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days), net of issuance costs\n1,733.5 \n549.3 \nRepayment of borrowings (maturities greater than 90 days)\n(1,000.0)\n(1,000.0)\nRepurchase of common shares\n(889.6)\n(272.9)\nPayment of dividends\n(111.2)\n(102.0)\nAll other financing activities\n71.1 \n18.0 \nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n$\n(792.7)\n$\n32.3 \nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, interest, pension funding, and other items impact reported cash flows.\nOperating cash flows were $1.5 billion in 2024, representing an increase of $173 million, or 12.8%, as compared to 2023, primarily attributable to the following factors:\n•\nYear-over-year increases of $35 million in Operating cash flow from net earnings, net of non-cash items (Amortization, Depreciation, Stock-based compensation, Gain on sale of property, Loss from divestiture, and Loss from equity investments).\n•\nThe aggregate changes in accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable generated $79 million of cash during 2024 compared to using $9 million of cash during 2023. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable, inventories, and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively we manage the cash conversion cycle, which generally represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers, and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.\n•\nThe aggregate change in prepaid expenses and other assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and changes in deferred income taxes used $40 million of cash in 2024 as compared to using $91 million in 2023. The year-over-year changes were driven by timing differences related to contract assets, contract liabilities, and payments of income taxes, interest, and restructuring. \nInvesting Activities\nCash outflows from investing activities increased by $1.6 billion in 2024 as compared to 2023 with the increase primarily due to a year-over year increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of approximately $1.6 billion, an increase in capital expenditures of approximately $13 million, and the cash infusion into the Invetech Divestiture entity totaling $14 million, partially offset by the year-over-year increase in proceeds from sale of property and business of approximately $54 million.\nCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing production capacity, replacing aged equipment, supporting product development initiatives for hardware and software offerings, improving information technology systems, and purchasing equipment that is used in revenue arrangements with customers. We expect capital spending to be between approximately $120 million and $150 million in 2025, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions. \n40\nTable \nof\n Contents\nFinancing Activities and Indebtedness\nFinancing cash flows consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of debt and commercial paper, payments of cash dividends to shareholders and share repurchases. Financing activities used cash of $793 million in 2024, and generated cash of $32 million in 2023.  \nFinancing activities during 2024 reflected the following transactions:\n•\nOn January 2, 2024, we drew down an additional $450 million of the Delayed-Draw Term Loan due 2024 as part of the funding for the acquisition of EA.\n•\nOn February 13, 2024, we completed the sale of our registered offering of the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes, yielding net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. \n•\nOn February 13 2024, we repaid $1.0 billion in outstanding principal of the Delayed-Draw Term Loan due 2024, using net proceeds from the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes.\n•\nWe repaid $597 million in net commercial paper repayments under the U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper program.\n•\nWe repurchased 12 million shares of our common stock for approximately $890 million, including excise tax payments, under our share repurchase program.\n•\nWe made dividend payments to common shareholders totaling $111 million.\n•\nAll other financing activities primarily include activities related to the stock incentive plan.\nFinancing activities during 2023 reflected the following transactions:\n•\nOn December 7, 2023, we entered into a term loan credit agreement, which provides for a 364-days delayed draw term loan facility up to an aggregate principal amount of $1.3 billion. On December 14, 2023, we drew down $550 million of the $1.3 billion delayed-draw senior unsecured term facility (“Delayed-Draw Term Loan due 2024”) as a Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”) Loan. The repayment of the principal is due on December 12, 2024. \n•\nWe borrowed $840 million in net commercial paper under the U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper program. \n•\nOn August 24, 2023, we repaid $250 million in outstanding principal of the Delayed-Draw Term Loan due 2023. On December 14, 2023, we repaid the remaining $750 million in outstanding principal and accrued interest thereon using the proceeds from the Delayed-Draw Term Loan due 2024 and available cash.\n•\nWe repurchased 4 million shares of our common stock for approximately $273 million under our share repurchase program.\n•\nDividend payments to common shareholders totaling $102 million.\nWe generally expect to satisfy any short-term liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flows and available cash primarily through term loans or issuances of commercial paper under the Commercial Paper Programs, with credit support provided by the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe carrying value of total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $3.7 billion. We had $2.0 billion available under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024. \nThe availability of the Revolving Credit Facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the Commercial Paper Programs when we have outstanding borrowings. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $650 million and $1.3 billion borrowings outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program, respectively. We expect to limit any future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow us to borrow, if needed, to repay any outstanding commercial paper as it matures.\nRefer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Company’s financing activities and indebtedness, including the Company’s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s commercial paper program, and the Revolving Credit Facility. Refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the Company’s share repurchase program. \nDividends\nOn November 6, 2024, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per common share paid on December 27, 2024 to holders of record on November 29, 2024. \n41\nTable \nof\n Contents\nCash and Cash Requirements\nCash\nAs of December 31, 2024, we held approximately $813 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 88% was held outside of the United States. Our cash and cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid investment-grade instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less.\nWe have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund our pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders, and support other business needs or objectives. With respect to our cash requirements, we generally intend to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions and repayment of maturing debt, we may also borrow under our commercial paper programs or credit facilities or enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under our commercial paper programs. We also may from time to time access the capital markets, including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.\nForeign cumulative earnings remain subject to foreign remittance taxes. We have made an election regarding the amount of earnings that we do not intend to repatriate due to local working capital needs, local law restrictions, high foreign remittance costs, previous investments in physical assets and acquisitions, or future growth needs. For most of our foreign operations, we make an assertion regarding the amount of earnings in excess of intended repatriation that are expected to be held for indefinite reinvestment. No provisions for foreign remittance taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely. The amount of foreign remittance taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given local law restrictions that may apply to a portion of such earnings, unknown changes in foreign tax law that may occur during the applicable restriction periods caused by applicable local corporate law for cash repatriation, and the various tax planning alternatives we could employ if we repatriated these earnings.\n42\nTable \nof\n Contents\nCash Requirements\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our short-term and long-term cash requirements as of December 31, 2024 under (1) long-term debt principal and interest obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under GAAP. The table below does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain.\n($ in millions)\nTotal\nDue within one year of December 31, 2024\nDue later than one year from December 31, 2024\nDebt and leases:\nLong-term debt principal payments \n(a)\n$\n3,718.8 \n$\n376.3 \n$\n3,342.5 \nInterest payments on long-term debt \n(b)\n759.4 \n133.9 \n625.5 \nOperating lease obligations \n(c)\n197.3 \n38.4 \n158.9 \nOther:\nPurchase obligations \n(d)\n445.7 \n366.2 \n79.5 \nOther liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under GAAP\n (e)(f)\n2,266.2 \n1,148.0 \n1,118.2 \nTotal\n$\n7,387.4 \n$\n2,062.8 \n$\n5,324.6 \n(a)\n The amount due within one year of December 31, 2024 is related to the Euro Term Loan due 2025 and Yen Term Loan due 2025. Refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Company’s indebtedness as of December 31, 2024.\n(b)\n Interest payments on long-term debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2024. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.\n(c)\n Includes future lease payments for operating leases having initial noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year. \n(d)\n Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction.\n(e)\n Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, pension benefit obligations, net tax liabilities, and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience. \n(f)\n Includes non-contractual obligations of $173 million of noncurrent gross unrecognized tax benefits. However, the timing of these liabilities is uncertain, and therefore, they have been included in the “due later than one year from December 31, 2024” column. The amounts also include our obligation under the TCJA for the transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits, which we expect to pay over eight years. Refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn addition to the obligations noted above, we have issued guarantees, consisting primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees, and performance and bid bonds, in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, financing counterparties, and governmental entities to secure our obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions. These guarantees are not recorded on our balance sheet and $41 million in commitments expire within one year of December 31, 2024 and $20 million later than one year from December 31, 2024.\nDuring 2024, we contributed $1 million and $8 million to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, respectively. During 2025, our cash contribution requirements for our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $1 million and $8 million, respectively. The ultimate amounts we will contribute depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates, and other factors.\nAs of December 31, 2024 we expect to have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical \n43\nTable \nof\n Contents\nexperience, the current economic environment, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.\nWe believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of our financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAcquired Intangibles and Goodwill\n: Our business acquisitions, including EA, typically result in the recognition of goodwill, developed technology, and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that we may incur. The fair value of acquired intangible assets are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by us. Significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted cash flows of the acquired business including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), revenue, revenue growth rates, royalty rates, customer attrition rates, and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. We engage third-party valuation specialists who review our critical assumptions and calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with material acquisitions. In connection with the EA acquisition in the first quarter of 2024, we recorded approximately $1.18 billion of goodwill and approximately $681 million of intangible assets. Refer to Notes 2, 3 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles, and acquisitions.\nIn performing our goodwill impairment testing, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily using a market based approach. We estimate fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of our reporting units, in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, we make judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to our reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. In certain circumstances we also evaluate other factors including results of the estimated fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach), market positions of the businesses, comparability of market sales transactions, and financial and operating performance in order to validate the results of the market approach. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates, and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.\nIn 2024, we performed goodwill impairment testing for our reporting units. Reporting units that include recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. We believe the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as we integrate these businesses and better position them for potential future earnings growth. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2024 indicated that, in all instances, the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. \nThe excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a multiple of the carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of our reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 1.6x to approximately 13.1x. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a multiple of the carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately 1.5x to approximately 11.8x. We evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of the reporting units, including, as applicable, results of the estimated fair value using an income approach, market positions of the businesses, comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance, and concluded no impairment charges were required. \nWe review identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred for intangible assets with definite lives requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. We also test intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions, and discount rates related to these assets. We evaluated events or circumstances that may indicate the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be fully recoverable during the year ended December 31, 2024, and recorded no impairments. \n44\nTable \nof\n Contents\nIf actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\n: \nWe derive revenue from the sale of products and services. Revenue is recognized when control over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining if control has transferred, we consider whether certain indicators of the transfer of control are present, such as the transfer of title, present right to payment, significant risks and rewards of ownership, and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality. To determine the consideration that the customer owes us, we make judgments regarding the amount of customer allowances and rebates, \nconsisting primarily of volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs. Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our revenue recognition policies. \nIf our judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, our reported revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected. Historically, our estimates of revenue have been materially correct.\nIncome Taxes\n: For a description of our income tax accounting policies, refer to Note 2 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. \nIn accordance with GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on our tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. \nOur deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. If we experience cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in the three-year period including the current and prior two years, we normally conclude that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized, unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise. However, if we experience cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the three-year period including the current and prior two years, we then consider a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized. These factors include historical operating results, known or planned operating developments, the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse, consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities, tax law carryback capability in the particular country, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. After evaluation of these factors, if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country, we would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required. To the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction, we establish a valuation allowance.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if, in our assessment, it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. We re-evaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (i) a tax audit is completed; (ii) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (iii) the applicable statute of limitations expires. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties with unrecognized tax positions in income tax expense.\nIn addition, we are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments (see “-Results of Operations - Income Taxes” and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). We review our global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings, and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary.\nAn increase in our 2024 effective tax rate of 1.0% would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2024 of approximately $10 million.\n45\nTable \nof\n Contents\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nFor a discussion of new accounting standards relevant to our businesses, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.",
