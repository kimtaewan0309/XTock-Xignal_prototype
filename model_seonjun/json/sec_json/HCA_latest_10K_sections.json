We strive to be the health care system of choice in the communities we serve by developing comprehensive networks locally and supporting these networks with enterprise expertise and economies of scale. Our strategy is organized around a framework that seeks to drive sustained growth by delivering operational excellence, attracting exceptional physicians and other health care professionals, developing comprehensive services, creating greater access and coordinating higher quality care for patients.\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n \nTo achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:\n \n•\ngrow our presence in existing markets; \n•\nachieve industry-leading performance in clinical, operational and satisfaction measures; \n•\nrecruit and retain physicians and other health care professionals to meet the need for high-quality health services; \n•\ncontinue to utilize economies of scale to grow the Company; and \n•\npursue a disciplined development strategy. \nOur strategy also emphasizes investments that seek to advance our clinical systems and digital capabilities, transform care models with innovative care solutions, expand our workforce development programs and enhance our health care networks and partnerships.\nHealth Care Facilities\n \nWe currently own, manage or operate hospitals, ASCs, freestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities, walk-in clinics, diagnostic and imaging centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers, comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, physician practices, home health agencies, hospices, outpatient physical therapy providers, home and community-based services providers, and various other facilities.\n \nAt December 31, 2024, we owned and operated 180 general, acute care hospitals with 49,114 licensed beds. Most of our general, acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board comprised of members of the local community.\n \nAt December 31, 2024, we operated six behavioral hospitals with 602 licensed beds. Our behavioral hospitals provide therapeutic programs, including child, adolescent and adult psychiatric care and adolescent and adult alcohol and drug abuse treatment and counseling.\n \nWe also operate outpatient health care facilities, which include ASCs, freestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities, walk-in clinics, diagnostic and imaging centers, comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers, physician practices and various other facilities. These outpatient services are an integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive health care networks in select communities. Most of our ASCs are operated through partnerships or limited liability companies, with majority ownership of each partnership or limited liability company typically held by a general partner or member that is an affiliate of HCA.\n \nCertain of our affiliates provide a variety of management services to our health care facilities, including patient safety programs, ethics and compliance programs, national supply contracts, equipment purchasing and leasing contracts, accounting, financial and clinical systems, governmental reimbursement assistance, construction planning and coordination, information technology systems and solutions, legal counsel, human resources services and internal audit services.\n \nSummary Risk Factors\nYou should carefully read and consider the risk factors set forth under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” as well as all other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect us. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Our business is subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties:\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n \nRisks related to our indebtedness:\n \n•\nWe have significant indebtedness and may incur further indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations. \n•\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. \n•\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. \nRisks related to human capital:\n \n•\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced nurses and other health care professionals and labor union activity. \n•\nOur performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians. \n•\nWe may be unable to attract, hire and retain a highly qualified workforce, including key management. \n \nRisks related to technology, data privacy and cybersecurity:\n \n•\nCybersecurity incidents or other forms of data breaches could result in the compromise of our facilities, confidential data or critical data systems, causing our operations to be impaired or impacted. A cybersecurity incident or other form of data breach could also give rise to potential harm to patients; remediation and other expenses; and exposure to liability under privacy and security laws, consumer protection laws, common law theories or other laws. Such incidents could subject us to litigation and foreign, federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business. \n•\nOur operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems. \n•\nHealth care technology initiatives, particularly those related to sharing patient data and interoperability and artificial intelligence (“AI”), involve risks that may adversely affect our operations. \n•\nWe may not be adequately reimbursed by third-party payers for services involving new technology.  \n \nRisks related to public health crises:\n•\nThe emergence and effects related to a potential future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease could adversely affect our business and operations.\nRisks related to governmental regulation and other legal matters:\n \n•\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes and uncertainty in the health care industry, including health care public policy developments and other changes to laws and regulations. We are unable to predict whether, what, and when changes in the health care industry may occur, and the effects and ultimate impact of any changes are uncertain and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n•\nChanges in government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues and business. \n•\nIf we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations. \n•\nState efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations. \n•\nWe may incur additional tax liabilities. \n•\nWe have been and could become the subject of government investigations, claims and litigation, as well as governmental and commercial payer audits. \n•\nWe may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities, which are costly to defend and may require us to pay significant damages if not covered by insurance. \n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n \nRisks related to operations, strategy, demand and competition:\n \n•\nOur hospitals and other facilities face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers. \n•\nAny increase in the volume of uninsured patients or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results of operations. \n•\nIf our volume of patients with private health insurance coverage declines or we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans, our revenues may be adversely affected. \n•\nChanges to physician utilization practices and treatment methodologies and other factors outside our control that impact demand for medical services may reduce our revenues. \n•\nThird-party payer controls designed to reduce costs and other payer practices intended to decrease inpatient services, surgical procedure volumes or reimbursement for services rendered may reduce our revenues.\n•\nWe may encounter difficulty acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses, encounter challenges integrating the operations of acquired hospitals and other health care businesses and/or become liable for unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of acquisitions. \n•\nOur facilities are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic, public health, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states. \n•\nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to changing global weather patterns. \n•\nThe industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues. \n \nRisks related to macroeconomic conditions:\n \n•\nOur overall business results may suffer during periods of general economic weakness or recessions. \n•\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in the market values of securities and interest rates. \nRisks related to ownership of our common stock:\n \n•\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends. \n•\nCertain of our investors may continue to have influence over us. \nSources of Revenue\n \nHospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or reimbursement rates for such services. Reimbursement rates for inpatient and outpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of third-party payer, the type of service (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n \nWe receive payments for patient services from the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through federal and state-based health insurance marketplaces (“Exchanges”)), private insurers and directly from patients. Our revenues by primary third-party payer classification and other (including uninsured patients) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRatio\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRatio\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRatio\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicare\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10,780\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10,585\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10,447\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaged Medicare\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,987\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,496\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9,201\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicaid\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,678\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,606\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,636\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaged Medicaid\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,980\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,879\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,998\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaged care and other insurers\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34,954\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n31,819\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29,120\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n48.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational (managed care and other insurers)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,682\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,509\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,317\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,542\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,074\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,514\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n70,603\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n64,968\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n60,233\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n \nMedicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying low-income individuals. Payment under the Medicare and Medicaid programs is conditioned on satisfaction of extensive provider enrollment requirements. All of our general, acute care hospitals located in the United States are eligible and enrolled to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than established hospital gross charges for the services provided.\n \nOur hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of health care services, including private health insurers, employers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”) and other managed care plans, including health plans offered through the Exchanges. These discount programs generally limit our ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.” For services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, patients are generally responsible for any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amounts of such exclusions, deductibles and coinsurance continue to increase. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from government health care programs or other third-party payers. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or for financial relief under our charity care policy. We may provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care under our charity care policy. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.\n \nMedicare\n \nIn addition to the reimbursement reductions and adjustments discussed below, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “BCA”) requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, resulting in a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs of 2% per fiscal year that extends through the first eight months of federal fiscal year 2032. We anticipate that the federal deficit will continue to place pressure on government health care programs, and it is possible that future deficit reduction legislation will impose additional spending reductions.\nInpatient Acute Care\n \nUnder the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general, acute care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient PPS, fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are established based on the patient’s assigned Medicare severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”). MS-DRGs classify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis. MS-DRG weights represent the average resources for a given MS-DRG relative to the average resources for all MS-DRGs. MS-DRG payments are adjusted for area wage differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as “new,” receive PPS reimbursement for inpatient capital costs based on MS-DRG weights multiplied by a geographically adjusted federal rate. When the cost to treat certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution, providers typically receive additional “outlier” payments. These payments are financed by offsetting reductions in the inpatient PPS rates. A high-cost outlier threshold is set annually at a level that targets estimated outlier payments equaling 5.1% of total inpatient PPS payments for the federal fiscal year.\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n \nMS-DRG payment rates are updated, and MS-DRG weights are recalibrated, using cost-relative weights each federal fiscal year (which begins October 1). The index used to update the MS-DRG payment rates (the “market basket”) gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the health care industry in purchasing goods and services. Each federal fiscal year, the annual market basket update is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. A decrease in payment rates or an increase in rates that is below the increase in our costs may adversely affect our results of operations.\n \nFor federal fiscal year 2024, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) increased the MS-DRG payment rates by approximately 3.1%. This increase reflected a market basket update of 3.3%, reduced by a 0.2 percentage point productivity adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2025, CMS increased the MS-DRG payment rates by approximately 2.9%. This increase reflects a market basket update of 3.4%, reduced by a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment.  Additional adjustments may apply, depending on patient-specific or hospital-specific factors. For example, the two-midnight rule limits payments to hospitals when services to Medicare beneficiaries are payable as inpatient services. In addition, under transfer policies, Medicare reimbursement rates may be reduced when an inpatient hospital discharges a patient to another hospital or, for specified MS-DRGs, to certain post-acute care settings. We anticipate that additional adjustments may apply in future payment years as a result of 2024 court decisions that vacated a low wage index policy CMS adopted in 2020. The policy had funded an increase to the wage index value for hospitals with low wage indexes by decreasing reimbursement for all other hospitals. CMS addressed the impact of the decision prospectively in its final rule updating inpatient hospital payment rates and policies for federal fiscal year 2025, but it is not yet clear how the agency will address the impact the low wage policy had in 2020 through 2024.\nCMS has implemented and is implementing a number of programs and requirements intended to transform Medicare from a passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and services. For example, hospitals that do not successfully participate in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program are subject to a 25% reduction of the market basket update. Hospitals that do not demonstrate meaningful use of electronic health records (“EHRs”) are subject to a 75% reduction of the market basket update.\n \nFurther, Medicare does not allow an inpatient hospital discharge to be assigned to a higher paying MS-DRG if certain designated hospital acquired conditions (“HACs”) were not present on admission and the identified HAC is the only condition resulting in the assignment of the higher paying MS-DRG. In this situation, the case is paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. There are currently 14 categories of conditions on the list of HACs. In addition, the 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC scores in the designated performance period receive a 1.0% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments in the applicable federal fiscal year. CMS has also established three National Coverage Determinations that prohibit Medicare reimbursement for erroneous surgical procedures performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis.\n \nUnder the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, payments to hospitals may also be reduced based on readmission rates. Each federal fiscal year, inpatient payments are reduced if a hospital experiences “excess” readmissions within the 30-day time period from the date of discharge for conditions or procedures designated by CMS during the prior performance review period. CMS has designated six conditions or procedures under the program, including heart attack, pneumonia and total hip arthroplasty. Hospitals with what CMS defines as excess readmissions for these conditions or procedures receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges in the federal fiscal year, not just discharges relating to the conditions or procedures subject to the excess readmission standard. The amount by which payments are reduced is determined by assessing a hospital’s performance relative to hospitals with similar proportions of dual eligible patients, subject to a cap established by CMS. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions can be up to 3% of a hospital’s base payments. Each hospital’s performance is publicly reported by CMS.\n \nIn addition, under the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program, CMS reduces the inpatient PPS payment amount for all discharges by 2.0% in each federal fiscal year. The total amount collected from these reductions is pooled, and the entire amount collected is redistributed as incentive payments to reward hospitals that meet certain quality performance standards established by CMS. CMS scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement ranges (relative to the hospital’s own past performance) for each applicable performance standard. Hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise. Hospitals that do not achieve the necessary level of quality performance receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. Hospitals are scored on a number of individual measures that are categorized into four domains: clinical outcomes; efficiency and cost reduction; safety; and person and community engagement.\n \n \n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n \nOutpatient\n \nCMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require. Depending on the services provided, a hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit. A payment rate is established for each APC and updated for each calendar year. Each calendar year, the annual market basket update is further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2024, CMS increased payment rates under the outpatient PPS by an estimated 3.1%. This increase reflected a market basket increase of 3.3%, reduced by a 0.2 percentage point productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2025, CMS increased payment rates by an estimated 2.9%. This increase reflects a market basket increase of 3.4%, reduced by a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. CMS requires hospitals to submit quality data relating to outpatient care to avoid receiving a 2.0 percentage point reduction in the annual payment update under the outpatient PPS.\n \nMedicare reimbursement for outpatient services may also be affected by broad shifts in payment policy. For example, the 340B Drug Pricing Program allows participating hospitals to purchase certain outpatient drugs from manufacturers at discounted rates. These hospitals are reimbursed for the discounted drugs under the same Medicare payment methodology and rates that apply to non-340B hospitals. In 2018, CMS implemented a payment policy that reduced Medicare payments for 340B hospitals for most drugs obtained at 340B-discounted rates and that resulted in increased payments for non-340B hospitals. Most of our facilities are non-340B hospitals. In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated this 340B program payment policy. In light of this U.S. Supreme Court decision and to achieve budget neutrality, CMS reduced payment rates for non-drug services under the outpatient PPS for calendar year 2023, and lump sum payments were distributed to affected 340B hospitals as the remedy for calendar years 2018 through 2022. In order to comply with budget neutrality requirements, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) finalized a corresponding offset in future non-drug item and service payments for all outpatient PPS providers (except new providers) that will reduce the outpatient PPS conversion factor by 0.5% annually. This adjustment will start in calendar year 2026 and continue for approximately 16 years.\nIn addition, CMS has implemented an expanded site-neutral payment policy for clinic visit services provided at all off-campus provider-based departments. Under the policy, clinic visit services provided at all off-campus provider-based departments are generally not covered as outpatient department services under the outpatient PPS, but rather are reimbursed at the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“Physician Fee Schedule”) rate, which is generally lower than the outpatient PPS rate.\nRehabilitation\n \nCMS reimburses inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) on a PPS basis. Under the IRF PPS, patients are classified into case mix groups that reflect the relative resource intensity typically associated with the patient’s clinical condition. The case mix groups are based upon impairment, age, functional motor and cognitive scores, and comorbidities (additional diseases or disorders from which the patient suffers). IRFs are paid a predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the patient’s case mix group and is adjusted for facility-specific factors, such as area wage levels, proportion of low-income patients, and location in a rural area. Each federal fiscal year, the IRF rates are updated using a market basket index, which is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2024, CMS increased IRF payment rates by an estimated 3.4%, reflecting an IRF market basket update of 3.6%, reduced by a 0.2 percentage point productivity adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2025, CMS increased IRF payment rates by an estimated 3.0%, reflecting an IRF market basket update of 3.5%, reduced by a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. CMS requires IRFs to report quality measures to avoid receiving a reduction of 2.0 percentage points to the market basket update.\n \nIn order to qualify for classification as an IRF, at least 60% of a facility’s inpatients during the most recent 12-month CMS-defined review period must have required intensive rehabilitation services for one or more of 13 specified conditions. IRFs must also meet additional coverage criteria, including patient selection and care requirements relating to pre-admission screenings, post-admission evaluations, ongoing coordination of care and involvement of rehabilitation physicians. A facility that fails to meet the 60% threshold, or other criteria to be classified as an IRF, will be paid under either the acute care hospital inpatient or outpatient PPS, which generally provide for lower payment amounts. As of December 31, 2024, we had four rehabilitation hospitals and 71 hospital rehabilitation units.\n \n \n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n \nPsychiatric\n \nInpatient hospital services furnished in behavioral hospitals and behavioral units of general, acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals are reimbursed on a PPS basis. The inpatient psychiatric facility (“IPF”) PPS is based upon a per diem payment, with adjustments to account for certain patient and facility characteristics. The IPF PPS contains an “outlier” policy for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a facility’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment rate in a manner intended to be budget neutral. Each federal fiscal year, IPF payment rates are updated using a market basket index, which is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2024, CMS increased IPF payment rates by an estimated 3.3%, which reflected a 3.5% IPF market basket increase with a negative 0.2 percentage point productivity adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2025, CMS increased the IPF payment rates by 2.8%, which reflects a 3.3% IPF market basket increase, reduced by a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. Together with other policy changes, total Medicare payments to IPFs are anticipated to increase by 2.5% in federal fiscal year 2025. Inpatient psychiatric facilities are required to report quality measures to CMS to avoid receiving a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket update. As of December 31, 2024, we had six behavioral hospitals and 43 hospital behavioral units.\n \nAmbulatory Surgery Centers\n \nCMS reimburses ASCs using a predetermined fee schedule. Reimbursements for ASC overhead costs are limited to no more than the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital outpatient PPS for the same procedure. If CMS determines that a procedure is commonly performed in a physician’s office, the ASC reimbursement for that procedure is limited to the reimbursement allowable under the Physician Fee Schedule, with limited exceptions. All surgical procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk or generally require an overnight stay, are payable as ASC procedures. From time to time, CMS expands the services that may be performed in ASCs, which may result in more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in hospitals being moved to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in ASCs may be moved to physicians’ offices. Some commercial third-party payers have adopted similar policies.\n \nHistorically, CMS updated reimbursement rates for ASCs based on changes to the consumer price index. However, for calendar years through 2025, CMS updates to ASC reimbursement rates are based on the hospital market basket index, partly to promote site-neutrality between hospitals and ASCs. For each federal fiscal year, the ASC payment system update is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2024, CMS increased ASC payment rates by 3.1%, which reflected a market basket increase of 3.3%, reduced by a 0.2 percentage point productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2025, CMS increased payment rates by 2.9%, which reflects a market basket increase of 3.4%, reduced by a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. In addition, CMS has established a quality reporting program for ASCs under which ASCs that fail to report on specified quality measures receive a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket update.\n \nHome Health\n \nCMS reimburses home health agencies under the Home Health PPS. Home health agencies are paid a national, standardized 30-day period payment rate if a period of care meets a certain threshold of home health visits (periods of care that do not meet the visit threshold are paid a per-visit payment rate for the discipline providing care). The daily home health payment rate is adjusted for case-mix and area wage levels. An outlier adjustment may be paid for periods of care where costs exceed a specific threshold amount. Each calendar year, home health payment rates are updated using a market basket index, which is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2024, CMS increased home health payment rates by 0.8%, based on a home health payment update percentage of 3.0%, which reflected a 3.3% market basket increase, reduced by a 0.3 percentage point productivity adjustment, among other changes. For calendar year 2025, total Medicare payments to home health agencies are anticipated to increase by 0.5%. This increase is based on a home health payment update percentage of 2.7%, which reflects a 3.2% market basket increase, reduced by a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment, among other adjustments. Home health agencies that do not submit required quality data are subject to a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket update. In addition, home health agencies are required to submit a one-time Notice of Admission (“NOA”) for each patient that establishes that the beneficiary is under a Medicare home health period of care. Failure to submit the NOA within five calendar days from the start of care results in a reduction to the 30-day period payment amount for each day from the start of care date until the date the NOA is submitted.\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n \nUnder the nationwide Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (“HHVBP”) Model, home health agencies receive increases or reductions to their Medicare fee-for-service payments of up to 5%, based on performance against specific quality measures relative to the performance of other home health providers. Data collected in each performance year will impact Medicare payments two years later.\n \nPayment of claims for home health services may be impacted by the Review Choice Demonstration, a program intended to identify and prevent home health services fraud, reduce the number of Medicare appeals, and improve provider compliance with Medicare program requirements. The program currently applies only to home health agencies in certain states, including North Carolina, Florida and Texas. Providers in these states may select either pre-claim review or post-payment review. Home health agencies that maintain high levels of compliance are eligible for additional options that may be less burdensome.\n \nHospice\n \nMedicare beneficiaries who have a terminal illness and a life expectancy of six months or less may elect to receive hospice benefits (palliative care) instead of standard coverage of treatment for the terminal illness and related conditions. Hospice services are paid under the Hospice PPS, under which CMS sets a daily rate for each day a patient is enrolled in the hospice benefit. The daily rate depends on the level of care provided to a patient (routine home care, continuous home care, inpatient respite care, or general inpatient care). Daily rates are adjusted for factors such as area wage levels. Each federal fiscal year, hospice payment rates are updated using the hospital inpatient market basket index, which is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2024, CMS increased hospice payment rates by 3.1%, which reflected a 3.3% market basket update, reduced by a 0.2 percentage point productivity adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2025, CMS increased hospice payment rates by 2.9%, which reflects a 3.4% market basket update, reduced by a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment.  Hospices that fail to satisfy quality reporting requirements receive a 4.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket update.\n \nOverall payments made by Medicare to each hospice are subject to an inpatient cap and an aggregate cap. The inpatient cap limits the number of days of inpatient care (general inpatient and respite) for which Medicare will pay up to a maximum of 20% of total patient care days. Days in excess of the limitation are paid at the routine home care rate. The aggregate cap limits the amount of Medicare reimbursement a hospice may receive for an individual patient in a given year. The aggregate cap is updated annually. In federal fiscal year 2025, the aggregate cap is $34,465.34. If a hospice’s Medicare payments exceed its inpatient or aggregate caps, it must repay Medicare for the excess amount.\n \nPhysician Services\n \nPhysician services are reimbursed under the Physician Fee Schedule system, under which CMS has assigned a national relative value unit (“RVU”) to most medical procedures and services that reflects the various resources required by a physician to provide the services, relative to all other services. Each RVU is calculated based on a combination of work required in terms of time and intensity of effort for the service, practice expense (overhead) attributable to the service and malpractice insurance expense attributable to the service. These three elements are each modified by a geographic adjustment factor to account for local practice costs and are then aggregated. While RVUs for various services may change in a given year, any alterations are required by statute to be virtually budget neutral, such that total payments made under the Physician Fee Schedule may not differ by more than $20 million from what payments would have been if adjustments were not made. CMS annually reviews resource inputs for select services as part of the potentially misvalued code initiative. To determine the payment rate for a particular service, the sum of the geographically adjusted RVUs is multiplied by a conversion factor. For calendar year 2024, CMS reduced the conversion factor by approximately 2.8%. Average payment rates under the Physician Fee Schedule will be reduced by approximately 2.9% in calendar year 2025.\nMedicare payments are adjusted based on participation in the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”), a payment methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Physicians and certain other health care clinicians are required to participate in one of two QPP tracks. Under both tracks, performance data collected in each performance year affects Medicare payments two years later. CMS expects to transition increasing financial risk to providers as the QPP evolves. The Advanced Alternative Payment Model (“Advanced APM”) track encourages participation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS through financial incentives, which are paid two years after the relevant performance period, if a provider has sufficient participation (based on percentage of payments or patients) in an Advanced APM. The incentive payments were initially set to expire after the 2023 performance year (with associated payments in 2025), but were extended for one year at a lower rate. After the 2024 performance year and associated payments in 2026, Advanced APM incentive payments will no longer be available. Instead, qualifying providers will receive positive adjustments to their Physician Fee Schedule payment rates. Providers participating in the Advanced APM track are exempt from the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”),\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n \nthe other QPP participation track. Providers electing the MIPS option receive payment incentives or are subject to payment reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meeting Promoting Interoperability standards related to the meaningful use of EHRs.  Positive payment adjustments are subject to a scaling factor to meet budget neutrality requirements; the maximum negative payment adjustment is 9%.\nOther\n \nCMS uses fee schedules to pay for physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic laboratory services, nonimplantable orthotics and prosthetics, services provided by independent diagnostic testing facilities and ambulance services.\n \nUnder the various PPS structures, the payment rates are adjusted for area differences in wage levels by a factor reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area compared to the national average wage level and taking into account occupational mix (“wage index”). To smooth variations and decrease volatility, CMS has implemented permanent, budget-neutral caps on year-to-year decreases in the wage indexes under certain PPS structures, including the hospital inpatient PPS and home health PPS.\n \nMedicare reimburses hospitals for a portion (65%) of deductible and coinsurance amounts that are uncollectable from Medicare beneficiaries.\nCMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”), which are geographically assigned across 12 jurisdictions to service both Part A and Part B providers. Home health and hospice providers are serviced across four MAC jurisdictions. While hospitals with operations across multiple geographies have the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, we have chosen, in most cases, to use the MACs assigned to the geographic areas in which our hospitals are located. CMS periodically re-solicits bids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can change as a result of the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flows.\nCMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through reviews of quality concerns and detections, and corrections of improper payments. Quality Improvement Organizations, for example, are groups of physicians and other health care quality experts that work on behalf of CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for goods and services that are reasonable and necessary, and that are provided in the most appropriate setting. Under the Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program, CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program. The compensation for RACs is based on their review of claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity, and the amount of overpayments and underpayments they identify. CMS limits the number of claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each provider’s claim denial rate for the previous year. CMS has implemented the RAC program on a permanent, nationwide basis and expanded the RAC program to the Managed Medicare program and Medicare Part D. CMS has transitioned some of its other integrity programs to a consolidated model by engaging Unified Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”) to perform audits, investigations and other integrity activities.\n \nWe have established policies and procedures to respond to requests from and payment denials by RACs and other Medicare contractors. Payment recoveries resulting from reviews and denials are appealable through administrative and judicial processes, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. We incur additional costs related to responding to requests and denials, including costs associated with responding to requests for records and pursuing the reversal of payment denials and losses associated with overpayments that are not reversed upon appeal. Depending upon changes to and the growth of the RAC program and other Medicare integrity programs, our success in appealing claims in future periods, and potential future delays in the appeals process, our cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n \nMedicare reimburses teaching hospitals for portions of the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education (“GME”) through statutory formulas that are generally based on the number of medical residents and which take into account patient volume or the number of hospital beds. Accrediting organizations review GME programs for compliance with educational standards. Many of our hospitals operate GME or other residency programs to train physicians and other allied health professionals.\n \nManaged Medicare\n \nUnder the Managed Medicare program (also known as Medicare Part C, or Medicare Advantage), the federal government contracts with private health insurers to provide members with Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. Managed Medicare plans can be structured as HMOs, PPOs or private fee-for-service plans. In addition to covering Part A and Part B benefits, the health insurers may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher premiums and\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n \nplan costs on beneficiaries. CMS makes fee payment adjustments based on service benchmarks and quality ratings and publishes star ratings to assist beneficiaries with plan selection. According to CMS data, approximately half of all Medicare enrollees participate in managed Medicare plans. Starting January 1, 2024, managed Medicare plans must adhere to the two-midnight rule, which requires managed Medicare plans provide coverage for an inpatient admission when the admitting physician expects the patient to require hospital care that crosses over two midnights. The implementation of the two-midnight rule had a modest impact on our 2024 admissions growth. Medicare Advantage enrollment is projected to continue to increase over the next decade.\n \nMedicaid\n \nMedicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states. These programs are administered by states under approved plans and waivers. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospital’s cost of services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”) requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes effectively at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. The majority of states adopted Medicaid expansion; however, a number of states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the expansion. Among the non-expansion states, the maximum income level required for individuals and families to qualify for Medicaid varies.\nThe number of individuals enrolled in Medicaid declined in 2024 in comparison to 2023. This decline reversed a trend of increased enrollment that occurred as a result of COVID-19 relief legislation that authorized a temporary increase in federal funds for certain Medicaid expenditures in states that maintained continuous Medicaid enrollment, among other requirements. The end of the continuous enrollment requirement in 2023, including the resumption of redeterminations for Medicaid enrollees, resulted in significant coverage disruptions and dis-enrollments of Medicaid beneficiaries. To increase state compliance with renewal, redetermination and reporting requirements, CMS has issued guidance to states and published an interim final rule establishing an enforcement framework, including potential monetary penalties for states that fail to comply.\nBecause most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often a state’s largest budget expenditure, many states have adopted or may consider adopting various strategies to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Budgetary pressures have historically resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states. Most states in which we operate have adopted statewide provider taxes to fund the non-federal share of Medicaid programs within the state. Some states that use provider taxes, including Florida and Texas, rely on local provider taxes that are administered by local governments. Many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Some states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement Medicaid expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. For example, the Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program, which is operated under a Medicaid waiver, enables the expansion of Medicaid managed care programs in the state and provides funding for uncompensated care. The funding amount to each hospital for uncompensated care is recalculated annually by the state and subject to changes in state policies. The total uncompensated care funding for the state is periodically reassessed by CMS and the state. In recent years, aspects of existing or proposed Medicaid programs have been subject to legal challenge, resulting in uncertainty. Additionally, federal legislation and administrative policies that shape administration of the Medicaid programs at the state level are subject to change, including as a result of changes in the presidential administration. For example, a federal court permitted Georgia to impose work and community engagement requirements under a Medicaid demonstration program that launched in mid-2023, and CMS administrators may in the future allow states to impose such conditions on enrollment or permit other eligibility restrictions. Changes to the federal funding formula for Medicaid could also have a significant impact on Medicaid programs and enrollment, particularly if federal contributions for Medicaid expansion populations decrease and those states are unable to offset the reductions. Further, some states have trigger laws that would end their Medicaid expansion or require other changes if federal funding is reduced. These issues are further discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nMany state Medicaid programs incorporate value-based purchasing models and related payment and delivery system reform initiatives that incentivize improvements in quality of care and cost-effectiveness. For example, federal funds under the Medicaid program may not be used to reimburse providers for treatment of certain provider-preventable conditions. Each state Medicaid program must deny payments to providers for the treatment of health care-acquired conditions designated by CMS as well as other provider-preventable conditions that may be designated by the state.\n \nCongress has expanded the federal government’s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program through the Medicaid Integrity Program. CMS employs UPICs to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n \nclaims, identify overpayments and perform other program integrity activities. The UPICs collaborate with states and coordinate provider investigations across the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, state Medicaid agencies are required to establish Medicaid RAC programs. These programs vary by state in design and operation.\n \nManaged Medicaid\n \nEnrollment in managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid programs. Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with one or more of the designated entities, usually a managed care organization. The provisions of these programs are state-specific. Certain states may direct managed care plans to pass through supplemental payments to designated providers, independent of services rendered, to ensure consistent funding of providers that serve large numbers of low-income patients. In an effort to more closely tie funds to delivery and outcomes, CMS is limiting these “pass-through payments” that are paid by states under managed Medicaid plan contracts and will generally prohibit such payments by 2027. However, CMS permits new pass-throughs of supplemental provider payments for up to a three-year period when states are transitioning Medicaid populations or services from a fee-for-service system to a managed care system.\n \nMedicaid State Directed and Supplemental Payments\n \nSome states make additional payments to providers through the Medicaid program that are separate from base payments and not specifically tied to an individual’s care. Medicaid supplemental payments may be in the form of payments, such as upper payment limit payments, that are intended to address the difference between Medicaid fee-for-service payments and Medicare reimbursement rates, or payments under other programs that vary by state under Section 1115 waivers. These supplemental reimbursement programs are generally authorized by CMS for a specified period of time and require CMS’ approval to be extended.\n \nIn addition, many states have implemented state directed payment (“SDP”) arrangements to direct certain Medicaid managed care plan expenditures. These arrangements, which are generally subject to annual approval by CMS, allow states to implement delivery system and provider payment initiatives by requiring Medicaid managed care organizations to pay providers according to specific rates or methods. For example, SDP arrangements may require managed care plans to implement value-based purchasing models or performance improvement initiatives, or may direct managed care plans to adopt specific payment parameters, such as minimum or maximum fee schedules for specific types of providers. States are increasingly using SDP arrangements, and some states have converted supplemental payment programs to SDP arrangements, diverting previously available funding. SDP arrangements can be limited to a specific subset of providers, and providers that do not satisfy applicable criteria may be ineligible for payments. If a state is unable to obtain future CMS approvals of these programs, our revenues could be negatively impacted. In addition, the use and nature of SDP arrangements are subject to policy changes. For example, CMS published a rule (the “Medicaid Managed Care Rule”) in May 2024 that addresses access, financing and quality within Medicaid managed care programs. The rule includes new and updated requirements for SDP arrangements intended to ensure a more consistent and transparent approach for participating states. The rule removes regulatory barriers to help states use SDP arrangements to implement value-based purchasing payment arrangements and include non-network providers in SDP arrangements. The rule also requires provider payment levels for SDPs for certain services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, to not exceed the average commercial rate. Further, the rule requires states to ensure each provider receiving an SDP attest by January 1, 2028 that they do not participate in any arrangement that holds taxpayers harmless for the cost of a tax. The various elements of the rule take effect between issuance and early 2028. It is possible that these developments and program reviews will result in the restructuring of or other significant changes to supplemental payment programs and SDP arrangements. We are unable to estimate the financial impact that program structure modifications and other program changes, if any, may have on our results of operations.\n \nOver the last three years, states in which the majority of our hospitals operate have implemented or enhanced their Medicaid supplemental payment programs and SDP arrangements. Revenues from these programs totaled approximately $4.9 billion and $3.9 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDisproportionate Share Hospital Payments\nSeparate from the state-administered programs outlined above, the federal Medicare program makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of low-income patients (Medicaid and Medicare patients eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income (“SSI”)). Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”) payment adjustments are determined annually based on certain statistical information required by HHS and are paid as a percentage addition to MS-DRG payments. The methodology for calculating DSH payment adjustments is affected by shifts in payment policy and is also subject to ongoing litigation. For example, in August 2023, CMS finalized changes to the\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n \ntreatment of patient days paid under demonstrations authorized under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act (“Section 1115”) (including through demonstration-authorized uncompensated and undercompensated care pools) in the Medicaid fraction of the DSH payment formula in a manner that will effectively lower DSH payments for many hospitals. However, in August 2024, a district court in Texas vacated the regulation, determining that CMS’ exclusion of patient days paid under such demonstrations was unlawful. Separately, in November 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a dispute focused on whether all patients enrolled in SSI assistance, even if no SSI payments were made during the month of a patient’s hospital admission, should be counted in the DSH methodology. These and other regulatory changes and court rulings could adversely impact our results of operations. CMS also distributes a payment to each DSH hospital that is allocated according to the hospital’s proportion of uncompensated care costs relative to the uncompensated care amount of other DSH hospitals.\nThe Medicaid program also provides for DSH payments, funded by both the federal government and state governments, which are intended to offset hospital uncompensated care costs. The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. States have broad discretion to define which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. Medicaid DSH payments are also affected by shifts in payment policy. For example, CMS published a final rule in February 2024 affecting how states calculate hospital-specific caps for Medicaid DSH payments. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation provided for reductions to the Medicaid DSH hospital program. Under current law, Medicaid DSH payments will be reduced by $8 billion for the period from April 1, 2025, through September 30, 2025, and in federal fiscal years 2026 and 2027.\nValue-Based Care Arrangements\nCMS has indicated that promoting value-based, person-centered care is among its top priorities, and commercial payers are also increasingly using value-based care arrangements. Generally, value-based care aims to hold providers accountable for delivering efficient, effective care, tying provider reimbursement to patient outcomes or related measures. Value-based care arrangements vary in the method for determining payments and the level of risk assumed, among other factors. For example, Medicare reimbursement may be adjusted based on quality and efficiency measures and/or compliance with quality reporting requirements. In addition, \nCMS websites make available to the public data submitted by hospitals, home health agencies, hospices, and other Medicare-certified providers in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, including performance data on quality measures and patient satisfaction\n.\nAn Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”), an example of a value-based arrangement, is a group of providers and suppliers that work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to attempt to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. ACOs are intended to promote accountability, coordinate care and produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. There are several types of ACO programs, including the Medicare Shared Savings Program (“MSSP”), which is Medicare's permanent ACO program. Medicare-approved ACOs that achieve quality performance standards while lowering growth in expenditures are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. Conversely, under some MSSP payment tracks, ACOs may be required to pay shared losses if expenditures exceed an established benchmark. Failure to meet quality performance standards may result in an ACO’s termination from the MSSP. CMS continues to explore strategies to accelerate the growth of and access to ACOs.\nThe CMS Innovation Center is responsible for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for health care that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while improving quality of care. For example, providers participating in bundled payment initiatives agree to receive one payment for services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care, accepting accountability for costs and quality of care. By rewarding providers for increasing quality and reducing costs and penalizing providers if costs exceed a set amount, these models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. Hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met. The CMS Innovation Center has implemented bundled payment models, including the Bundled Payment Care Improvement Advanced program, which is voluntary and expected to run through December 2025. Participation in bundled payment programs is generally voluntary, but CMS required hospitals in selected geographic areas to participate in a mandatory bundled payment program for specified orthopedic procedures, which ended December 31, 2024. Hospitals in selected markets will be required to participate in a new model focused on five specified surgical procedure episodes beginning in January 2026.\n \nBy 2030, the CMS Innovation Center aims to have all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries and most Medicaid beneficiaries in a care relationship with accountability for quality and total cost of care. CMS also indicated it will streamline its payment model portfolio and consider how to ensure broad provider participation, including by\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n \nimplementing more mandatory models. Several private third-party payers are increasingly employing alternative payment models, which may increasingly shift financial risk to providers.\n \nTRICARE\n \nTRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health care program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. For outpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to that utilized for outpatient services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.\n \nAnnual Cost Reports\n \nAll hospitals, home health agencies, hospice providers and other institutional providers participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each provider type to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.\n \nAnnual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of cost reports.\n \nManaged Care and Other Discounted Plans\n \nMost of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of health care services, including managed care plans and private health insurers. Admissions reimbursed by commercial managed care and other insurers were 32%, 30% and 30% of our total admissions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms between one and three years. While we generally have received contracted annual increases to payment rates from managed care payers, there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive increases in the future. Price transparency initiatives may impact our relationships with payers and ability to obtain or maintain favorable contract terms. For example, hospitals are required to publish a list of their standard charges for all items and services, including gross charges, discounted cash prices and payer-specific and de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges, in a machine-readable, publicly accessible online file. Further, \nCMS requires most health insurers to publish online charges negotiated with providers for health care services\n.\n \nUninsured and Self-Pay Patients\n \nSelf-pay revenues are derived from providing health care services to patients without health insurance coverage and from the patient responsibility portion of payments for our health care services that are not covered by an individual’s health plan. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than collection of amounts due from government health care programs or private third-party payers. Any increases in uninsured individuals, changes to the payer mix or greater adoption of health plan structures that result in higher patient responsibility amounts could increase amounts due from individuals. The No Surprises Act requires providers to provide uninsured and self-pay patients, in advance of the scheduled date for the item or service or upon request of the individual, a good faith estimate of the expected charges for furnishing scheduled items or services, including billing and diagnostic codes. HHS is delaying enforcement with regard to good faith estimates to uninsured individuals that do not include expected charges for co-providers or co-facilities until the agency issues additional regulations. If the actual charges to the uninsured or self-pay patient exceed the good faith estimate by an amount deemed to be substantial by regulation (which is currently $400) or the provider furnishes an item or service that was not included in the estimate, the patient can invoke a patient-provider dispute resolution process to challenge the higher amount.\n \nA high percentage of our uninsured patients are initially admitted through our emergency rooms. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 86% of our admissions of uninsured patients occurred through our emergency rooms. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. In addition, federal and some state laws require health insurers to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place.\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n \nHospital Utilization\n \nWe believe the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital are the quality and market position of the hospital and the number and quality of physicians and other health care professionals providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a hospital to be a market leader is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, quality and condition of the facilities, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that impact utilization include the growth in local population, local economic conditions and market penetration of managed care programs.\n \nThe following table sets forth certain operating statistics for our health care facilities. Health care facility operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in the cold weather months.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of hospitals at end of period\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n190\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n186\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n182\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of freestanding outpatient surgery centers at end of period(a)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n124\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n124\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n126\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of licensed beds at end of period(b)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49,985\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49,588\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49,281\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted average beds in service(c)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42,633\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n41,873\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n41,982\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmissions(d)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,236,595\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,130,728\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,075,459\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquivalent admissions(e)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,990,085\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,788,434\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,611,299\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage length of stay (days)(f)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage daily census(g)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29,581\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28,721\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28,778\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy rate(h)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n73\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n72\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n72\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency room visits(i)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9,789,265\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9,342,783\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,971,951\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutpatient surgeries(j)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,024,998\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,044,415\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,023,239\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient surgeries(k)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n540,704\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n528,845\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n522,151\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDays revenues in accounts receivable(l)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n53\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n53\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutpatient revenues as a % of patient revenues(m)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n \n(a)\nExcludes freestanding endoscopy centers (26 at December 31, 2024, 24 at December 31, 2023 and 21 at December 31, 2022). \n(b)\nLicensed beds are those beds for which a facility has been granted approval to operate from the applicable state licensing agency. \n(c)\nRepresents the average number of beds in service, weighted based on periods owned. \n(d)\nRepresents the total number of patients admitted to our hospitals and is used by management and certain investors as a general measure of inpatient volume. \n(e)\nEquivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent admissions are computed by multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue. The equivalent admissions computation “equates” outpatient revenue to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume, resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. \n(f)\nRepresents the average number of days admitted patients stay in our hospitals. \n(g)\nRepresents the average number of admitted patients in our hospital beds each day. \n(h)\nRepresents the percentage of hospital beds in service that are occupied by patients (admitted and observations).

Additionally, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers, diagnostic and imaging centers and other medical facilities in the geographic areas in which we operate continues to increase. As a result, most of our hospitals and other facilities operate in a highly competitive environment. In some cases, competing facilities are more established than we are. Some competing facilities are physician-owned or are owned by tax-supported government agencies, and many others are owned by not-for-profit entities that may be supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and are exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to our facilities and may provide the tax-supported or not-for-profit entities an advantage in funding capital expenditures. In certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at most of our hospitals. We also face competition from specialty hospitals and from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs for market share in certain high margin services. Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their immediate locale and, therefore, our behavioral hospitals and units compete with both local and regional hospitals, including the behavioral units of general, acute care hospitals.\n \nTrends toward clinical and pricing transparency may impact our competitive position, ability to obtain or maintain favorable contract terms and patient volumes in ways that may be difficult to predict. For example, hospitals are required to publish a list of their standard charges for all items and services, including gross charges, discounted cash prices and payer-specific and de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges, in a machine-readable, publicly accessible online file. In addition, \nCMS websites make available to the public data submitted by hospitals, home health agencies, hospices, and other Medicare-certified providers in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, including performance data on quality measures and patient satisfaction\n.\n \nOur strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals and other facilities are competitive. We believe our hospitals and other facilities compete within local communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality of care, ability to attract and retain quality physicians, skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals, location, breadth of services, technology offered and quality and condition of the facilities. We focus on operating outpatient services with accessibility and convenient service for patients and predictability and efficiency for physicians.\n \nTwo of the most significant factors that impact the competitive position of a hospital are the number and quality of physicians affiliated with or employed by the hospital. Although physicians may at any time terminate their relationship with a hospital we operate, our hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied specialties on the hospitals’ medical staffs and to attract other qualified physicians. We believe physicians refer patients to a hospital based on the quality and scope of services the hospital renders to patients and physicians, the quality of physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital’s facilities, technology, equipment and employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide quality facilities, technology, equipment, employees and services for physicians and patients. Our hospitals face competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models.\n \nAnother major factor in the competitive position of our hospitals and other facilities is our ability to negotiate service contracts with group purchasers of health care services. Managed care plans attempt to direct and coordinate members’ use of health care services and obtain discounts from providers’ established gross charges. Similarly, employers and traditional health insurers continue to attempt to contain costs through negotiations with providers for managed care programs and discounts from established gross charges. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group purchasers of health care services on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. Legislative and regulatory initiatives may impact our contract terms or ability to contract with payers, such as laws that permit payers to guide patients to particular providers and eliminate restrictions on placing providers into preferred tiers. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our contracts with third-party payers and enter into new contracts on favorable terms. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into contracts with third-party payers or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. Price transparency initiatives and increasing vertical integration efforts involving third-party payers and health care providers, among other factors, may increase these challenges. Moreover, the trend toward consolidation among private third-party payers tends to increase payer bargaining power over fee structures, and private third-party payers may increasingly demand reduced fees or be unwilling to negotiate reimbursement increases. Health plans increasingly utilize narrow networks that restrict the number of participating providers or tiered networks that impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations on patients who obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier. The importance of obtaining contracts with group purchasers of health care services varies by purchaser and by community, depending on the market position of such\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n \norganizations. In addition, changes in the payer contracts of our competitors may impact the payer mix and patient volume of our hospitals and other facilities.\nState certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place limitations on a health care facility’s ability to expand services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise make changes in operations, may also have the effect of restricting competition. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. Before issuing a CON or other approval, these states consider the need for additional, changes in, or expanded health care facilities or services. Removal of these requirements could reduce barriers to entry and increase competition in our service areas. In those states that do not require state approval or that set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. Other federal and state laws and regulations may also adversely impact our ability to expand, such as a regulation commonly known as the “36 Month Rule.” This rule, which applies to home health agencies and hospices, restricts the assumption by a new majority owner of the provider’s Medicare provider agreement and billing privileges within 36 months of the provider’s effective date of initial Medicare enrollment or most recent change in majority ownership. In addition, changes in licensure or other laws or regulations and recognition of new provider types or payment models could impact our competitive position. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”\nWe and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations and interpretations and contracting for provider services by third-party payers remain ongoing challenges.\n \nAdmissions, average lengths of stay and reimbursement amounts continue to be negatively affected by third-party payer pre-admission authorization requirements, utilization review and pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Increased competition, admission constraints and third-party payer pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we intend to expand and update our facilities or acquire or construct new facilities where appropriate, enhance the provision of a comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer market competitive pricing to group purchasers of health care services, upgrade facilities and equipment and offer new or expanded programs and services.\n \nRegulation and Other Factors\n \nLicensure, Certification and Accreditation\n \nHealth care facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire prevention, rate-setting, building codes and environmental protection. Facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing, certification, and accreditation. We believe our health care facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws.\n \nEach of our acute care hospitals located in the United States is eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. To receive reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, organizational providers and suppliers and individuals must satisfy extensive enrollment and revalidation requirements. CMS has the authority to deny or revoke Medicare enrollment and deactivate billing privileges for a variety of reasons. An adverse action relating to Medicare enrollment may impact a provider’s Medicaid eligibility, and adverse actions relating to Medicaid enrollment may impact Medicare enrollment. If any facility were to lose its Medicare or Medicaid certification, the facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from applicable federal health care programs. Each of our general, acute care hospitals located in the United States is accredited by The Joint Commission or another health care accrediting organization. From time to time, we may acquire a facility that is not accredited but for which we will seek accreditation. If any facility were to lose accreditation, the facility would be subject to state surveys, potentially be subject to increased scrutiny by CMS and likely lose payment from private third-party payers.\n \nThe Controlled Substances Act and Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) regulations require every person who dispenses controlled substances to be registered with the DEA at each principal place of business or professional practice where the person dispenses controlled substances, subject to limited exceptions. Each hospital or clinic must hold a DEA registration at each location and may be subject to similar state registration requirements. In addition, we are subject to a variety of federal and state statutes and regulations that govern operational issues related to pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, such as those related to packaging, storing, and dispensing of pharmaceutical drugs, inventory\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n \ncontrol and recordkeeping requirements for controlled substances, and other standards intended to prevent diversion of controlled substances. The DEA, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), HHS, and state boards of pharmacy have broad enforcement powers, may conduct audits and investigations and can impose substantial fines and other penalties, including revocation of registration.\n \nManagement believes our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change, and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation also include notification or approval in the event of the transfer or change of ownership or certain other changes. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary approvals in these circumstances can result in the inability to complete an acquisition or change of ownership, loss of licensure, lapses in reimbursement or other penalties.\n \nCertificates of Need\n \nIn some states where we operate hospitals and other health care providers, the construction or expansion of health care facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of ownership, capital expenditures and the addition of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of, or notifications to, state regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded health care facilities and services or other change. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary state approvals can result in the inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or expenditure or change ownership or other penalties.\n \nFederal Health Care Program Regulations\n \nParticipation in any federal health care program, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by statute and regulation. If a hospital or other provider fails to substantially comply with the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the provider’s participation in the federal health care programs may be terminated, or civil and/or criminal penalties may be imposed. Civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index.\n \nAnti-kickback Statute\n \nA section of the Social Security Act known as the “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held that there is a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required. Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by criminal fines per violation, imprisonment, substantial civil monetary penalties per violation that are subject to annual adjustment based on updates to the consumer price index and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) as a false or fraudulent claim.\n \nThe HHS Office of Inspector General (the “OIG”), among other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations and inspections. The OIG provides guidance to the industry through various methods, including advisory opinions and “Special Fraud Alerts.” These Special Fraud Alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features of arrangements or transactions that the government believes may cause the arrangements or transactions to violate the Anti-kickback Statute or other federal health care laws. The OIG has identified several incentive arrangements that constitute suspect practices, including: (a) payment of any incentive by a hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the hospital, (b) the use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment in facilities usually located close to the hospital, (c) provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other staff services, (d) free training for a physician’s office staff in areas such as management techniques and laboratory techniques, (e) guarantees which provide, if the physician’s income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the remainder, (f) low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital, (g) payment of the costs of a physician’s travel and expenses for conferences or payments to a physician for speaking engagements, (h) coverage on the hospital’s group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician, (i) payment for services (which may include consultations at the hospital) which require few, if any, substantive duties by the physician, (j) purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value, (k) rental of space in physician offices, at other than fair market value terms, by persons or entities to which physicians refer, and (l)\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n \nphysician-owned entities (frequently referred to as physician-owned distributorships or PODs) that derive revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, implantable medical devices ordered by their physician-owners for use on procedures that physician-owners perform on their own patients at hospitals or ASCs. The OIG has encouraged persons having information about hospitals who offer the above types of incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG.\n \nThe OIG also issues “Special Advisory Bulletins” as a means of providing guidance to health care providers. These bulletins, along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain arrangements that could be subject to heightened scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, including: (a) contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint venture arrangements between those in a position to refer business, such as physicians, and those providing items or services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and (b) certain “gainsharing” arrangements, i.e., the practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a hospital’s costs for patient care attributable in part to the physician’s efforts.\n \nIn addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program guidance for certain types of health care providers. The OIG guidance identifies a number of risk areas under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. These areas of risk include compensation arrangements with physicians, recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians.\n \nAs authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe harbors for various activities, including the following: certain investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, ambulance replenishing, referral agreements for specialty services, care coordination arrangements, arrangements for patient engagement and support, CMS-sponsored model arrangements, cybersecurity technology and related services, and value-based arrangements.\n \n \nThe fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or is identified in a Special Fraud Alert, Special Advisory Bulletin or other guidance does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.\n \nWe have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians, including employment contracts, leases, medical director agreements and professional service agreements. We also have similar relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients are referred from our facilities and other providers. In addition, we provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection.\n \nAlthough we believe our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with the Anti-kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to liabilities under the Social Security Act and other laws, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs.\n \nStark Law\n \nThe Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” The Stark Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, if these entities provide certain “designated health services” reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid from billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral on a timely basis. “Designated health services” include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services, radiology and certain other imaging services, radiation therapy services and home health services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, substantial civil monetary penalties per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty for a circumvention scheme. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n \nThere are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases, recruitment agreements and personal service arrangements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, a financial relationship must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law. Although there is an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital, the Affordable Care Act prohibits physician-owned hospitals established after December 31, 2010 from billing for Medicare or Medicaid patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare or Medicaid. While the Affordable Care Act grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services.\n \nThrough a series of rulemakings, CMS has issued final regulations implementing the Stark Law. While these regulations were intended to clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes. Further, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of the Stark Law and its implementing regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and are subject to continuing legal and regulatory change. We cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law.\n \nOther Fraud and Abuse Provisions\n \nCertain federal fraud and abuse laws apply to all health benefit programs and provide for criminal penalties. The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for making false claims and statements to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for unnecessary goods and services and cost report fraud. Federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare and Medicaid any business entities and any investors, officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had no knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other prohibited activities, including failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing arrangements, billing Medicare amounts that are substantially in excess of a provider’s usual charges, offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of a health care provider, contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal health care program, making or accepting a payment to induce a physician to reduce or limit services, and soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring an individual for an item or service payable by a federal health care program. Like the Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad. Civil penalties may be imposed for the failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. To avoid liability, providers must, among other things, carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, promptly return overpayments and accurately prepare cost reports.\n \nSome of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Substantial civil monetary penalties may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law. These penalties will be updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In some cases, violations of the Civil Monetary Penalty Law may result in penalties of up to three times the remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition, a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state health care programs. Federal and state governments increasingly use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, especially where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further, individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least $100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity Program.\n \nIn addition, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (“EKRA”) establishes criminal penalties for paying, receiving, soliciting or offering any remuneration in return for referring a patient to a laboratory, clinical treatment facility or recovery home, or in exchange for an individual using the services of one of these entities. The EKRA prohibitions apply to services covered by government health care programs and by private health plans. There is limited guidance with respect to the application of EKRA.\n \nState Fraud and Abuse Laws\n \nMany states in which we operate also have laws intended to prevent fraud and abuse within the health care industry. Some of these laws are similar to the Anti-kickback Statute, prohibiting payments to physicians for patient referrals, and to the Stark Law, prohibiting certain self-referrals. These state laws often apply regardless of the source of payment for care, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure.\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n \nThe Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws\n \nWe are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement and prohibit the making of false claims or statements. One of the most prominent of these laws is the FCA, which may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a \nqui tam\n plaintiff, or whistleblower, on the government’s behalf. The government may use the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors, billing for services not provided and submitting false cost reports. In addition, the FCA covers payments made in connection with the Exchanges if those payments include any federal funds. When a private party brings a \nqui tam \naction under the FCA, the defendant is not made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or makes a determination whether it will intervene. If a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus substantial mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.\n \nThere are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA defines the term “knowingly” broadly. Though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with actual knowledge of, deliberate ignorance of or reckless disregard to its truth or falsity constitutes a “knowing” submission under the FCA and, therefore, may create liability. Submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. Whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. False claims under the FCA also include the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government in a timely manner following identification of an overpayment. An overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person knowingly, as defined under the FCA, receives or retains an overpayment.\n \nEvery entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. In addition, federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws comparable to the FCA. A number of states in which we operate have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions under which a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. We have adopted and distributed policies pertaining to the FCA and relevant state laws.\n \nHIPAA Administrative Simplification, Privacy and Security Standards and Interoperability Requirements\n \nThe Administrative Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transaction standards and code sets for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. In addition, HIPAA requires each provider to use a National Provider Identifier. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry.\n \nThe privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and require covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations apply to business associates (entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity.\n \nCovered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days after discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information.\n \nViolations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties per violation. These civil penalties are updated annually based on updates to the consumer price index. HHS\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n \nenforces the regulations and performs compliance audits. In addition to enforcement by HHS, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. HHS may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. We enforce compliance in accordance with HIPAA privacy and security regulations. The Privacy and Information Protection and Security Departments monitor our compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. The HIPAA privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on our facilities in order to comply with these standards.\nHealth care providers and industry participants are also subject to a growing number of requirements intended to promote the interoperability and exchange of patient health information. For example, health care providers and certain other entities are subject to information blocking restrictions pursuant to the 21\nst\n Century Cures Act that prohibit practices that are likely to interfere with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or specified by HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. Violations may result in penalties or other significant disincentives. In a final rule published in July 2024, HHS established disincentives for hospitals, MIPS-eligible clinicians (including group practices) and ACOs and ACO providers that commit information blocking. Hospitals found to have committed information blocking will not qualify as “meaningful electronic health record users” under the Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program and as a result will lose 75% of the annual market basket increase they would otherwise receive. Similar penalties apply to MIPS-eligible clinicians and ACOs, ACO participants, and ACO providers or suppliers under the Medicare Shared Savings Program.\n \nEMTALA\n \nAll of our hospitals in the United States are subject to EMTALA. This federal law requires any hospital participating in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include exclusion from participation in the Medicare program and civil monetary penalties. These civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, an injured individual, the individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of a hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital.\n \nThe government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which individuals do not actually present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. At least one court has interpreted the law also to apply to a hospital that has been notified of a patient’s pending arrival in a non-hospital owned ambulance. In enforcement actions, the government has broadly interpreted a hospital’s obligations with respect to screening and stabilizing patients who present with a psychiatric emergency. EMTALA does not generally apply to individuals admitted for inpatient services. The government has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively. Hospitals may face conflicting interpretations of EMTALA’s requirements with respect to state laws that limit access to abortion or other reproductive health services. For example, HHS has provided guidance regarding EMTALA obligations specific to patients who are pregnant or are experiencing pregnancy loss and the preemption of state law. This guidance has been the subject of legal challenges, including a pending case in Idaho under which the state is currently enjoined from enforcing its state law restricting abortion to the extent the state law conflicts with EMTALA. The final ruling from a Texas case limits application of the HHS guidance in Texas.\nCorporate Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting\n \nSome of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting corporations and other entities not owned by physicians or other permitted health professionals from employing physicians or certain other health professionals, practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and indirect payments to, or entering into fee-splitting arrangements with, health care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician or other health professional may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n \nHealth Care Industry Investigations\n \nSignificant media and public attention has focused in recent years on the hospital industry. This media and public attention, changes in government personnel and other factors have led to increased scrutiny of the health care industry. Except as may be disclosed in our SEC filings, we are not aware of any material investigations of the Company under federal or state health care laws or regulations. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate investigations or litigation in the future at facilities we operate and that such matters could result in significant penalties, as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and managers could be included in governmental investigations or litigation or named as defendants in private litigation.\n \nOur substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. We continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.\n \nHowever, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our practices or industry practices.\n \nIn public statements surrounding current investigations, governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of issues, including some for which little official interpretation previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent with practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been challenged in this manner. In some instances, government investigations that have in the past been conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be conducted as criminal investigations.\n \nBoth federal and state government agencies have increased their focus on and coordination of civil and criminal enforcement efforts in the health care area. Through the national Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program, the OIG and the DOJ coordinate federal, state and local law enforcement activities with respect to health care fraud against both public and private health plans. The OIG and DOJ have, from time to time, established national enforcement initiatives that target all hospital providers, focusing on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. In addition, governmental agencies and their agents, such as MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, may conduct audits of our health care operations. Private third-party payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.\n \nIn addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and state investigations have addressed a wide variety of routine health care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices, including for Medicare outliers; financial arrangements with referral sources; physician recruitment activities; physician joint ventures; and hospital charges and collection practices for self-pay patients. We engage in many of these routine health care operations and other activities that could be the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, we have significant Medicare and Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources to our hospitals, and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Any additional investigations of the Company, our executives or managers could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as adverse publicity.\n \n \nPrice Transparency and Consumer Billing Limitations\n \nThe health care industry is subject to various federal and state initiatives and requirements related to price transparency and out-of-network charges. For example, federal regulations require hospitals to publish a list of their standard charges for all items and services, including gross charges, discounted cash prices and payer-specific and de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges, in a machine-readable, publicly accessible online file. Hospitals are required to publish a consumer-friendly list of standard charges for certain “shoppable” services (i.e., services that can be scheduled by a patient in advance) and associated ancillary services or, alternatively, maintain an online price estimator tool. CMS may impose civil monetary penalties for noncompliance with these price transparency requirements. Further, \nCMS requires most health insurers to publish online charges negotiated with providers for health care services. Most health insurers must also provide online price comparison tools to help individuals get personalized cost estimates for covered items and services\n.\n \nIn addition, the No Surprises Act imposes various requirements on providers and health plans intended to prevent “surprise” medical bills, and several states have implemented similar laws intended to protect consumers. The No Surprises Act prohibits providers from charging patients an amount beyond the in-network cost sharing amount for items and services rendered by out-of-network providers (i.e., prohibits balance billing), subject to limited exceptions. The No Surprises Act also impacts the payment received by an out-of-network provider from a health plan for items and services to which the prohibitions on balance billing apply. For items and services for which balance billing is prohibited (even\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n \nwhen no balance billing occurs), the No Surprises Act establishes an independent dispute resolution (“IDR”) process for providers and payers to handle payment disputes that cannot be resolved through direct negotiations. The final rule establishing the IDR process is currently the subject of legal challenges, and government agencies have proposed various changes, creating uncertainty and resulting in delays in claims resolution. The No Surprises Act also requires providers to provide a good faith estimate of expected charges to uninsured or self-pay individuals in connection with scheduled items or services, in advance of the date of the scheduled item or service, or upon request of the individual. HHS is delaying enforcement with regard to good faith estimates to uninsured individuals that do not include expected charges for co-providers or co-facilities until the agency issues additional regulations. If the actual charges to an uninsured or self-pay patient exceed the good faith estimate by an amount deemed to be substantial by regulation (which is currently $400) or the provider furnishes an item or service that was not included in the good faith estimate, the patient may invoke a patient-provider dispute resolution process established by regulation to challenge the higher amount.\nMedical Technology Regulation and Developments\n \nParticipants in the health care industry must frequently adapt to scientific and technological innovations and initiatives. These advances can change the way services are delivered and offer business efficiencies, among other benefits, and impact the competitive position of providers. The design and introduction of new products and services and changes to existing products and services are subject to complex laws and regulation and oversight by various agencies, including HHS and the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Further, advances may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation and ethical concerns and impact patient care.\n \nFor example, we deploy third-party software programs, and in some instances develop our own software programs, utilizing machine learning/AI, including for use within our network to improve care. The legal framework for AI (particularly in patient care) is rapidly developing and uncertain. In 2023, HHS finalized transparency requirements for AI and other predictive algorithms used in certified health information technology, such as decision support interventions. In some cases, software can be considered a medical device under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the FDCA. In September 2022, the FDA issued non-binding final guidance that describes the types of clinical decision support software that the FDA will regulate as a medical device, potentially including software programs that were not previously treated as medical devices. Application of the new guidance may result in our current and/or future software programs used by us to provide clinical decision support being subject to FDA regulation. Some states have adopted or are considering additional measures regarding the use of AI within the health care industry. For example, California enacted Assembly Bill 3030, known as the Artificial Intelligence in Health Care Services Bill (“AB 3030”), which requires that any health care facility using generative AI to create patient communications pertaining to patient clinical information ensure that the communications include (i) a disclaimer that the communication was generated by generative AI and (ii) clear instructions describing how a patient may contact a human health care provider or other appropriate person at the health care facility. Further, Utah enacted the Artificial Intelligence Policy Act (“AIPA”), which requires physicians, nurses and other regulated health care providers to disclose to individuals if they are interacting with generative AI while receiving regulated services. Additionally, Colorado has passed the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act (“CAIA”), which will impose significant disclosure, documentation, and risk management requirements on developers of and companies that deploy “high-risk” AI systems, including systems used to recommend certain health care decisions. If we or our third-party providers are restricted from using AI as a result of any laws or regulations, it could impact our operations and cause us to incur costs to replace or modify our use of AI. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party providers to comply with AI laws and regulations could result in legal proceedings or investigations, which could result in significant legal costs and potential liability, as well as reputational harm. Further, we expect additional AI-related laws and regulations to come into effect, which could affect our business and financial condition.\nWe also perform clinical laboratory testing, and some of the tests performed are considered “laboratory developed tests” (“LDTs”). On May 6, 2024, the FDA published a final rule to increase regulatory oversight of LDTs as medical devices, classifying the tests as in vitro diagnostic products. The rule is currently the subject of legal challenges. The requirements imposed by the FDA under this rule will, over a four-year phase-in period that starts May 6, 2025, require our clinical laboratories to make significant adjustments and implement processes to comply with certain FDA medical device laws and regulations and may require FDA review or approval for LDTs used in patient care that are either newly marketed or modified after May 6, 2024.\n \nFailure to obtain necessary approvals for regulated technologies or noncompliance with other applicable regulatory requirements could result in penalties or require us to make changes to our operations, including changes to services currently rendered. For example, if the FDA determines that any of our software programs are medical devices under the FDCA, the use of those software programs may require premarket approval or clearance, and we may be required to cease use of such programs until we obtain any required premarket approval or clearance.\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n \nDevelopments in Health Care Public Policy\n \nThe health care industry is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. Regulatory uncertainty has increased as a result of recent decisions issued by the U.S. Supreme Court that affect review of federal agency actions and the outcome of the 2024 federal election. The Supreme Court decisions increase judicial scrutiny of agency authority, shift greater responsibility for statutory interpretation to courts and expand the timeline in which a plaintiff can sue regulators. In \nLoper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo\n, the Court overruled a legal framework that gave significant judicial deference to federal agency interpretations of federal statutes. The Court held that courts must instead exercise independent judgment when deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority and that courts may not defer to an agency interpretation simply because a statute is ambiguous. The \nLoper Bright\n decision and other recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are expected to have significant impacts on government agency regulation, particularly within the heavily regulated health care industry, in part through an increase in legal challenges to health care regulations and agency guidance and decisions. Federal agencies oversee, regulate and otherwise affect many aspects of our business, including through Medicare and Medicaid payment and coverage policies, policies affecting the size of the uninsured population, administration of state Medicaid programs, and enforcement and interpretation of fraud and abuse laws. The recent Supreme Court decisions may also result in inconsistent judicial interpretations and delays in and other impacts to agency rulemaking and legislative processes. The outcome of the 2024 federal election may increase regulatory uncertainty and the potential for significant policy changes. Recent presidential executive orders have been issued that impact or may impact the health care industry, including an order establishing a presidential advisory commission focused on restructuring and streamlining government agencies and reducing or eliminating regulations and federal government programs and other expenditures.\nThe health care industry has been and continues to be impacted by health care reform efforts at the federal and state levels. Many recent changes have been aimed at reducing costs and government spending and increasing access to health insurance. For example, the Affordable Care Act increased health insurance coverage through a combination of private sector health insurance requirements, public program expansion and other reforms. Changes in the law’s implementation, subsequent legislation and regulations, state initiatives and other factors have affected and may continue to affect the number of individuals that elect or are able to obtain public or private health insurance and the scope of such coverage, if purchased. For example, the American Rescue Plan of 2021 (“ARPA”) temporarily enhanced premium tax credits available for purchasing coverage through the Exchanges by lowering premiums and raising income eligibility thresholds. Subsequent legislation extended these enhanced premium tax credits through 2025. However, further extension is uncertain, and we believe their expiration would adversely impact Exchange enrollment and significantly increase the uninsured rate. Other legislative and executive branch initiatives related to health insurance, such as permitting the sale of insurance plans that lack currently required consumer protections, could increase rates of uninsured and underinsured individuals and destabilize insurance markets.\nHealth care providers may also be significantly impacted by reforms to the Medicaid program, including changes resulting from legislation and administrative actions at the federal and state levels. Changes at the federal level may impact funding for, or the structure of, the Medicaid program and may shape administration of the program at the state level. The Affordable Care Act expands the categories of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage, permits individuals with relatively higher incomes to qualify and provides states with enhanced funding for expansion populations. The majority of states adopted Medicaid expansion; however, a number of states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Changes to the federal funding formula for Medicaid could have a particularly significant impact in states that expanded Medicaid, especially if federal contributions for Medicaid expansion populations decrease and states are unable to offset the reductions. Further, some states have trigger laws that would end their Medicaid expansion if federal funding is reduced. CMS administrators may also make changes to Medicaid payment models and may grant states additional flexibility in the administration of state Medicaid programs, including by allowing additional states to condition Medicaid enrollment on work or other community engagement or permitting other eligibility restrictions. Some states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment conditions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. The Medicaid landscape is constantly evolving as the federal and state governments consider and test various models of delivery and payment system reform.\n \nIn addition, there is uncertainty regarding the potential impact of other reform efforts at the federal and state levels. For example, some members of Congress have proposed measures intended to accelerate the shift from traditional Medicare to Medicare Advantage or eliminating some or all of the consumer protections established by the Affordable Care Act. Other recent initiatives and proposals include those aimed at price transparency and out-of-network charges, which may impact prices and the relationships between health care providers, insurers and patients. Reform efforts could also include changes to Medicare reimbursement, such as new or expanded site-neutral payment policies that may reduce payments received or further attempt to equate rates of reimbursement for outpatient hospital services with payment for similar services provided in other patient care settings. Other industry participants, such as private payers and large employer groups and their affiliates, may also introduce financial or delivery system reforms. For example, in recent\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n \nyears, there have been trends influenced by private and/or public payers toward enrollment in managed care programs, favoring outpatient care over inpatient care, and provider consolidation. These issues are further discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\n \nGeneral Economic and Demographic Factors\n \nThe health care industry is impacted by the overall U.S. economy. Budget deficits at the federal level and within some state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending for many health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals and other providers. We anticipate that federal and state budget deficits, the growing magnitude of Medicare and Medicaid expenditures and the aging and health status of the U.S. population, among other factors, will continue to place pressure on government health care programs. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased adoption of health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients and increased difficulties in collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible amounts.\n \nCompliance Program\n \nWe maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the ethics and compliance program, we provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees and encourage all employees to report any violations to their supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or to the Company’s ethics line available 24 hours a day by phone and internet portal.\n \nAntitrust Laws\n \nThe federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation, bid-rigging, concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ, including with respect to hospital and physician practice acquisitions. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our operations and growth strategy.\n \nEnvironmental Matters\n \nWe are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances and other laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations as presently in effect. Regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs may increase in coming years, which may increase our costs associated with compliance, disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially, adversely affect our financial performance.\n \nOur environmental strategy is designed to complement our mission of the care and improvement of human life, which extends to the environment. This strategy is centered on incorporating the following four pillars into our operations:\n \n•\nManaging energy and water responsibly, \n•\nPreparing for weather impacts, \n•\nSourcing and consuming efficiently, and \n•\nManaging the environmental impact of our capital programs. \nOur initiatives contemplate operational changes intended to reduce energy consumption, including by accelerating related capital investments, new technology pilots, energy contracting and investments, and medical gas initiatives. We have also integrated climate-related risk assessment into our established enterprise risk management function.\nWhile we currently believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations does not have a material impact on our operations, changes in consumer preference and legislation or regulatory requirements, including\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n \nthose associated with efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy, may increase costs associated with compliance, the operation of our facilities and supplies.\n \nInsurance\n \nAs is typical in the health care industry, we are subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of business. Subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our insurance subsidiary for losses up to $110 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of either $25 million or $35 million per occurrence, depending on the jurisdiction for the related claim. We also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.\n \nWe purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for cybersecurity incidents, directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts we believe are reasonable and subject to terms of coverage we believe to be reasonable.\n \nHuman Capital Resources\n \nOur workforce consists of approximately 316,000 employees (as of December 31, 2024), including approximately 90,000 part-time and PRN employees (references herein to “employees” or “colleagues” refer to employees of our affiliates). Our Board of Directors and its committees oversee human capital matters through regular reporting from management and advisors.\n \n \nCulture and Values\n \nWe believe HCA Healthcare’s culture helps drive our success. We strive to foster a culture of compassion and respect, across our system, to provide high-quality care for our patients, unlock opportunities for our colleagues and improve the health of our communities. Our policies prohibit discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, color, ancestry, citizenship, religion, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, medical condition, marital status, veteran status, payment source or ability, or any other basis prohibited by federal, state or local law.\n \n \nWe encourage you to review our 2024 Impact Report (available at www.hcahealthcareimpact.com) for more detailed information regarding how we foster care and respect for our patients and colleagues. Nothing on our website, including our annual Impact Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.\n \n \nRecruitment and Workforce Development\n \nWe are dedicated to being an employer of choice and seek to recruit candidates through a variety of venues and programs. We continue to invest in expanding access to high-quality health care and addressing nursing and physician shortages through Galen College of Nursing and graduate medical education. Additionally, we are developing enterprise-wide, colleague-facing upskilling programs as well as partnering with academic institutions to create training programs that bolster the allied health talent pipeline.\n \n \nEngagement, Retention and Talent Development\n \n \nWe believe that excellent people make excellence happen and are committed to selecting and supporting colleagues who can bring our mission to life. We regularly connect with our colleagues, capturing their feedback through rounding, advisory groups, governance councils and surveys, and strive to take appropriate action on identified opportunities. We also have programs designed to support our colleagues throughout their career journey. By providing education, training and benefits like tuition reimbursement and student loan repayment assistance we help our colleagues fully realize their potential.\n \nWe are committed to developing leaders who support our culture and help us work to grow our business and lead the industry. Through the award-winning HCA Healthcare Leadership Institute, we seek to develop the capabilities of our leaders, building and strengthening our talent pipeline. Our commitment to leadership development and succession planning is a foundation from which we seek to expand our impact on the communities we serve.\n \n \n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n \nCompensation and Benefits\n \n \nTo recruit and retain a highly qualified workforce, we design competitive compensation and benefits programs to attract, retain, recognize and reward the performance of our employees. These programs (which vary by location) include incentive programs, an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) plan, health care and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, employee assistance and well-being programs, volunteer opportunities, and tuition and student loan payment assistance.\n \n \nHealth, Safety and Wellness\n \n \nWe focus on supporting colleagues in ways that we believe have a positive impact on their physical, mental and financial health so they can take care of themselves, their families, their patients and each other. These resources and programs include counseling, fertility and menopause care, financial and retirement planning, consumer discounts and insurance, and family benefits.\n \n \nServing the Community\n \n \nWe strive to provide not only the quality health care that our patients deserve, but also to address needs in the communities we serve. We provide opportunities for our colleagues to get involved and be a part of something bigger than our organization. By joining forces with other leading organizations, we believe our collective talents and work have an impact that is only possible when we work together. Through research, partnerships, leadership and investments, we are tackling problems in our communities and throughout the health care industry. We also support the HCA Healthcare Foundation in promoting health and wellbeing in the communities HCA Healthcare serves through leadership, service and financial support to non-profit organizations.\nLabor Matters\n \nWe are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. At December 31, 2024, certain employees at 35 of our domestic hospitals are represented by various labor unions. Three elections were held in 2024 that resulted in the addition of a number of employees to existing bargaining units at three of our facilities in California and Nevada. One election was held in 2024 that resulted in our employees choosing not to unionize at one of our facilities in Colorado, and there was another election in 2024 to remove union representation at one of our facilities in Texas. There are no elections scheduled to be held in 2025. It is possible that employees at additional hospitals may unionize in the future, or employees currently represented by labor unions may choose to reject that representation. We have not experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. However, it is possible that a material work stoppage at one or more of our hospitals may occur in the future.\n \nPhysicians are an integral part of the success of our hospitals in delivering quality care to our patients. Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and set compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time. We continue to experience increasing competition to recruit and retain quality physicians, as well as increasing costs to contract with hospital-based physicians.\nOur facilities, like most health care facilities, have experienced challenges related to labor costs and turnover. Nurse and medical support personnel availability and retention can present significant operating issues for our hospitals and other facilities, including capacity and growth constraints, reduced patient satisfaction, reduced physician satisfaction, impact on services offered and increased costs. To address these challenges, we implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity.  While these efforts alleviated some of the competitive pressures our hospitals and facilities faced in 2024, there can be no assurance we will not experience operating issues due to the costs and availability of nurse and medical support personnel in the future.\n \nWe may be required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel and to utilize more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase at rates in excess of historical levels. We also depend on the available labor pool of employees in each of the markets in which we operate\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n \nto fill other necessary positions. If there is additional union organizing activity or a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase. In addition, we operate in states that have adopted mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or mandate staffing committees to develop staffing plans. If these states reduce mandatory nurse to patient ratios or additional states in which we operate adopt mandatory nurse to patient ratios or other measures to regulate staffing, our compliance with such measures could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions to comply.\n \nThe inability to attract, retain and utilize sufficient, quality clinical and non-clinical personnel could impair our capacity, ability to grow and results of operations.\n \nInformation about our Executive Officers\n \nAs of February 1, 2025, our executive officers were as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n \n\n\nAge\n \n\n\nPosition(s)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamuel N.

The 2024 results include gains on sales of facilities of $14 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. The 2024 results also include additional expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $250 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, related to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which impacted our facilities in North Carolina and certain facilities in Florida. The 2023 results include losses on sales of facilities of $5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Our provisions for income taxes for 2024 and 2023 include tax benefits of $102 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, and $93 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 261.806 million shares and 276.412 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 17.798 million and 14.465 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.\n \nRevenues increased to $70.603 billion for 2024 from $64.968 billion for 2023. Revenues increased 8.7% and 7.9%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2024, compared to 2023. The consolidated revenues increase can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 5.3% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. The same facility revenues increase resulted primarily from the combined impact of a 4.5% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. Our revenues from Medicaid state directed and supplemental payment programs totaled approximately $4.9 billion and $3.9 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring 2024, consolidated admissions increased 5.0% and same facility admissions increased 4.9%, compared to 2023. Inpatient surgical volumes increased 2.2% on both a consolidated basis and a same facility basis during 2024, compared to 2023. Outpatient surgical volumes declined 1.9% on a consolidated basis and declined 1.6% on a same facility basis during 2024, compared to 2023. Emergency room visits increased 4.8% on a consolidated basis and increased 4.9% on a same facility basis during 2024, compared to 2023.\n \nThe estimated cost of total uncompensated care increased $646 million for 2024, compared to 2023. Consolidated and same facility uninsured admissions increased 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively, and consolidated and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 13.8% and 13.5%, respectively, for 2024, compared to 2023.\n \nInterest expense totaled $2.061 billion for 2024, compared to $1.938 billion for 2023. The $123 million increase in interest expense for 2024 was primarily due to an increase in the average debt balance.\n \nCash flows from operating activities increased $1.083 billion, from $9.431 billion for 2023 to $10.514 billion for 2024. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was related primarily to an increase in net income of $542 million, excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities, and a positive change in working capital items of $351 million, mainly from a decline in inventories and other assets.\nBusiness Strategy\n \nWe are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, convenient and cost-effective health care while growing our business and creating long-term value for our stockholders. We strive to be the health care system of choice in the communities we serve by developing comprehensive networks locally and supporting these networks with enterprise expertise and economies of scale. Our strategy is organized around a framework that seeks to drive sustained growth by delivering operational excellence, attracting exceptional physicians and other health care professionals, developing comprehensive services, creating greater access, and coordinating higher quality care for patients. To achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:\n \nGrow Our Presence in Existing Markets.\n We believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. We plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and developing comprehensive service lines such as cardiology, neurology, oncology, orthopedics and women’s services. Additional components of our growth strategy include providing access and convenience through developing various outpatient facilities, including, but not limited to surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency care facilities, imaging centers and home health and hospice services, as well as seeking to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets.\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\n \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\n \nBusiness Strategy (continued)\nAchieve Industry-Leading Performance in Clinical, Operational and Satisfaction Measures.\n Achieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business. To achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. We routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. We believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.\n \nRecruit and Retain Physicians and Other Health Care Professionals to Meet the Need for High Quality Health Services.\n We depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. We believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other health care professionals to provide high quality care. We attract and retain physicians and other health care professionals by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. We believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians and other health care professionals will improve the quality of care at our facilities.\n \nContinue to Utilize Economies of Scale to Grow the Company.\n We believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow our company by fully utilizing the scale and scope of our organization. We continue to invest in initiatives such as care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. We believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. We continue to invest in our shared service platforms to deploy key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.\n \nPursue a Disciplined Development Strategy.\n We continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. We will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-market opportunities. To complement our in-market growth agenda and achieve cost savings and other benefits for the patients and communities we serve, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers.\n \nOur strategy also emphasizes investments that seek to advance our clinical systems and digital capabilities, transform care models with innovative care solutions, expand our workforce development programs and enhance our health care networks and partnerships.\n \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n \nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n \n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\n \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\n \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)\nRevenues\n \nRevenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding management’s interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. We have invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. We have developed standardized calculation processes and related employee training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.\n \nPatients treated at hospitals for non-elective care who have income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level are eligible for charity care, and we limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of the federal poverty level. Patients treated at hospitals for non-elective care who have income above 400% of the federal poverty level are eligible for certain other discounts which limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of the federal poverty level. We apply additional discounts to limit patient responsibility for certain emergency services. The federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. We may provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance, or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.\n \nImplicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Estimated implicit price concessions are recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the age of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been performed. The estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and collections at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. We believe our quarterly updates to the estimated implicit price concession amounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable estimates of our revenues and valuations of our accounts receivable. These routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to the valuations of our accounts receivable or period-to-period comparisons of our revenues.\n \nTo quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured patient accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view total uncompensated care, which is comprised of charity care, uninsured discounts and implicit price concessions. A summary of the estimated cost of total uncompensated care for the years ended December 31, follows (dollars in millions):\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient care costs (salaries and benefits, supplies, other operating\n   expenses and depreciation and amortization)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n60,056\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n55,341\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n51,180\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost-to-charges ratio (patient care costs as percentage of gross\n   patient charges)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal uncompensated care\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n43,231\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n35,426\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n31,734\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiply by the cost-to-charges ratio\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated cost of total uncompensated care\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,366\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,720\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,491\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\n \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\n \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (Continued)\nRevenues (continued)\nManagement expects a continuation of the challenges related to collection of patient due accounts. Adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations. See Item 1, “Business — Developments in Health Care Public Policy.”\n \nProfessional Liability Claims\n \nWe, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. Our facilities are insured by our insurance subsidiary for losses up to $80 million per occurrence ($110 million effective January 1, 2025), subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of either $25 million or $35 million per occurrence, depending on the jurisdiction for the related claim. We purchase excess insurance on an occurrence reported basis for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $627 million, $619 million and $517 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We recorded an increase to the provision for professional liability risks of $40 million during 2023 and a reduction to the provision for professional liability risks of $55 million for 2022, due to the receipt of updated actuarial information.\n \nReserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. Individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. Case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. Once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. Several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. These methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. Company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. This company-specific data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.\n \nReserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. The estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.855 billion to $2.221 billion at December 31, 2024 and $1.863 billion to $2.230 billion at December 31, 2023. Our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. We perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. Based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. We consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. A 2.5% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $31 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $30 million. A 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $121 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $113 million. We believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.\n \n \n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\n \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\n \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (Continued)\nProfessional Liability Claims (continued)\nThe reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,100 individual claims at both December 31, 2024 and 2023 and estimates for unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. The average time period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately five years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an occurrence-to-resolution timeframe that varies from this average. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.\n \nReserves for professional liability risks were $2.131 billion and $2.089 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The current portion of these reserves, $587 million and $532 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is included in “other accrued expenses.” Obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. Reserves for professional liability risks (net of $80 million and $42 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively) were $2.051 billion and $2.047 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are comprised of $1.059 billion and $947 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $992 million and $1.100 billion, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims. The 2024 increase in case reserves for known claims and the corresponding decrease in reserves for incurred but not reported claims is the result of changes in case management processes at our insurance subsidiary that include establishing case reserve estimates earlier and resolving claims quicker.\n \nChanges in our professional liability reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet reserves for professional liability claims, January 1\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,047\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,983\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,967\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for current year claims\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n545\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n573\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n538\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfavorable (favorable) development related to prior years’ claims\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n82\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(21\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal provision\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n627\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n619\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n517\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayments for current year claims\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayments for prior years’ claims\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n588\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n537\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n493\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal claim payments\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n600\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n550\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n497\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of new retroactive reinsurance contracts\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(23\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(4\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet reserves for professional liability claims, December 31\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,051\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,047\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,983\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nIncome Taxes\n \nWe calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods. Interest and penalties payable to taxing authorities are included as a component of our provision for income taxes. We have elected to treat taxes incurred on global intangible low-taxed income as a period expense.\n \nAlthough we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or foreign taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. Significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns. During each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. If the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. Final audit results may vary from our estimates.\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\n \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\n \nResults of Operations\n \nRevenue/Volume Trends\n \nOur revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. Gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. Our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.\n \nRevenues increased 8.7% to $70.603 billion for 2024 from $64.968 billion for 2023 and increased 7.9% for 2023 from $60.233 billion for 2022. The increase in revenues in 2024 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 5.3% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission compared to the prior year. The increase in revenues in 2023 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 4.9% increase in equivalent admissions and a 2.8% increase in revenue per equivalent admission compared to the prior year.\nSame facility revenues increased 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 and increased 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The 7.9% increase for 2024 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 4.5% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. The 7.6% increase for 2023 can be primarily attributed to the net impact of a 4.8% increase in equivalent admissions and a 2.7% decline in revenue per equivalent admission.\nConsolidated admissions increased 5.0% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 2.7% during 2023 compared to 2022. Consolidated inpatient surgical volumes increased 2.2% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 1.3% during 2023 compared to 2022. Consolidated outpatient surgical volumes declined 1.9% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 2.1% during 2023 compared to 2022. Consolidated emergency room visits increased 4.8% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 4.1% during 2023 compared to 2022.\n \nSame facility admissions increased 4.9% during 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 3.3% during 2023 compared to 2022.

Our Florida facilities’ revenues totaled $16.600 billion, $14.990 billion and $13.753 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2024, we owned and operated 54 hospitals and 40 surgery centers in the state of Texas. Our Texas facilities’ revenues totaled $19.832 billion, $17.871 billion and $16.472 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, 59%, 58% and 58%, respectively, of our admissions and 52%, 51% and 50%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our Florida and Texas facilities. Uninsured admissions in Florida and Texas represented 74%, 73% and 74%, respectively, of our uninsured admissions during 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n \nWe receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. Some state Medicaid programs use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement Medicaid expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. We receive supplemental payments in several states. These supplemental payment programs are regularly reviewed by certain government agencies and some states have made requests to CMS to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. In May 2024, CMS issued a final rule related to Medicaid managed care programs that addresses access, financing and quality within these programs. This final rule addresses aspects of state directed program arrangements with new and updated requirements to ensure a more consistent and transparent approach for participating states. The various elements of the rule take effect between issuance and early 2028. It is possible that these developments, reviews and requests will result in the restructuring of or other significant changes to supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. Because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications and other program changes, if any, may have on our results of operations.\n \nKey Performance Indicators\nWe present certain metrics and statistical information that management uses when assessing our results of operations. We believe this information is useful to investors as it provides insight to how management evaluates operational performance and trends between reporting periods.

The 2024 results include gains on sales of facilities of $14 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. The 2024 results also include additional expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $250 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, related to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which impacted our facilities in North Carolina and certain facilities in Florida. The 2023 results include losses on sales of facilities of $5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Our provisions for income taxes for 2024 and 2023 include tax benefits of $102 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, and $93 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 261.806 million shares and 276.412 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 17.798 million and 14.465 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.\n \nDuring 2024, consolidated admissions increased 5.0% and same facility admissions increased 4.9% compared to 2023. Consolidated and same facility inpatient surgeries each increased 2.2% during 2024 compared to 2023. Emergency room visits increased 4.8% on a consolidated basis and increased 4.9% on a same facility basis during 2024 compared to 2023.\n \nRevenues increased 8.7% to $70.603 billion for 2024 from $64.968 billion for 2023. The increase in revenues was due primarily to the combined impact of a 5.3% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission compared to 2023. Same facility revenues increased 7.9% due primarily to the combined impact of a 4.5% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission compared to 2023. Our revenues from Medicaid state directed and supplemental payment programs totaled approximately $4.9 billion and $3.9 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nSalaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 44.1% in 2024 and 45.4% in 2023. Salaries and benefits per equivalent admission increased 0.4% in 2024 compared to 2023. Same facility salaries and benefits per full time equivalent increased 1.8% for 2024 compared to 2023. We continue to utilize certain contract, overtime and other premium rate labor costs to support our clinical staff and patients. While these costs have declined compared to the prior year period, future costs may be affected by labor market conditions and other factors.  Share-based compensation expense was $360 million in 2024 and $262 million in 2023.\nSupplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 15.2% in both 2024 and 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 3.1% in 2024 compared to 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 5.6% for medical devices and 3.2% for general medical and surgical items, but declined 2.4% for pharmacy supplies in 2024 compared to 2023.\n \nOther operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 21.0% in 2024 and 19.8% in 2023. Other operating expenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. The 1.2% increase in other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues for 2024 compared to 2023, was primarily related to increased costs for state provider fees in certain states, professional fees and repairs and maintenance, primarily related to remediation activities in certain hospitals in the state of Florida in response to Hurricane Milton. We have seen inflation have a negative impact on certain of these expenses and expect inflationary pressures will continue to impact operating expenses in 2025. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $627 million and $619 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded an increase of $40 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, during 2023 to our provision for professional liability risks related to the receipt of updated actuarial information.\n \nEquity in earnings of affiliates was $23 million for 2024 and $22 million for 2023.\n \nDepreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenues, were 4.7% in both 2024 and 2023. Depreciation expense was $3.294 billion for 2024 and $3.052 billion for 2023. The increase of $242 million in depreciation expense relates primarily to capital expenditures at our existing facilities.\n \n \n \n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\n \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\n \nResults of Operations (continued)\nYears Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (continued)\nInterest expense increased to $2.061 billion for 2024 from $1.938 billion for 2023. The $123 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the average debt balance.  The average effective interest rate for our long-term debt was 5.0% for both 2024 and 2023. Our average debt balance was $41.388 billion for 2024 compared to $38.790 billion for 2023.\nGains on sales of facilities were $14 million for 2024 and losses on sales of facilities were $5 million for 2023.\nThe effective income tax rate was 24.5% for 2024 and 23.6% for 2023. The effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships.\n \nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from $849 million for 2023 to $897 million for 2024. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to the operations of one of our Texas markets and our surgery center partnerships.\n \nFor results of operations comparisons relating to years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022, refer to our annual report on Form 10-K, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 16, 2024.\n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nOur primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, dividends to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Our primary cash sources are from operating activities, issuances of debt securities and sales of hospitals and health care entities.\n \nCash provided by operating activities totaled $10.514 billion in 2024 compared to $9.431 billion in 2023 and $8.522 billion in 2022. The $1.083 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2024, compared to 2023, was related primarily to an increase in net income of $542 million, excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities, and a positive change in working capital items of $351 million, mainly from a decline in inventories and other assets. The decrease in inventories during 2024 was the result of a targeted effort by our supply chain management to manage and reduce the inventory levels carried in our facilities. The $909 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2023, compared to 2022, was related primarily to a positive change in working capital items of $695 million, mainly from an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and an increase in net income of $275 million, excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt.  Cash payments for interest and income taxes increased $504 million for 2024 compared to 2023.  Working capital totaled $1.237 billion at December 31, 2024 and $2.272 billion at December 31, 2023. The decline in working capital is primarily due to the $2.274 billion increase in long-term debt due within one year, offset by an increase of $998 million in cash and cash equivalents and an increase of $793 million in accounts receivable.\nCash used in investing activities was $4.933 billion, $5.317 billion and $3.389 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $4.875 billion in 2024, $4.744 billion in 2023 and $4.395 billion in 2022. Planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate between $5.0 billion and $5.2 billion in 2025. At December 31, 2024, there were projects under construction which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately $4.7 billion. We expect to fund capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds. We expended $266 million, $635 million and $224 million for acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash flows from sales of hospitals and health care entities increased to $328 million of net proceeds for 2024 from $193 million of net proceeds for 2023, and was $1.237 billion in 2022 primarily related to proceeds from our sales of other health care entities.\n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\n \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\nCash used in financing activities totaled $4.582 billion in 2024, $4.094 billion in 2023 and $5.656 billion in 2022. During 2024, we had a net increase of $3.205 billion in our indebtedness, paid dividends of $690 million and paid $6.042 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2023, we had a net increase of $1.295 billion in our indebtedness, paid dividends of $661 million and paid $3.811 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2022, we had a net increase of $3.287 billion in our indebtedness, paid dividends of $653 million and paid $7.000 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $711 million, $640 million and $1.025 billion, respectively. The increase in distributions in 2022 was related to the sale of a controlling interest in a subsidiary of our group purchasing organization.\n \nWe, or our affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable SEC and other legal requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws.\n \nDuring January 2023, January 2024 and January 2025, our Board of Directors authorized $3 billion, $6 billion and $10 billion, respectively, for share repurchases of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The January 2023 authorization was completed during 2024, and at December 31, 2024, there was $764 million of share repurchase authorization that remained available under the January 2024 authorization. Funds for the repurchase of debt or equity securities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds.\n \nDuring 2024, our Board of Directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.66 per share, or $2.64 per share in the aggregate, on our common stock. On January 23, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.72 per share on our common stock payable on March 31, 2025 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2025. The timing and amount of future cash dividends will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements of the Company.\n \nIn addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($7.986 billion as of both December 31, 2024 and January 31, 2025) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets.\n \nInvestments of our insurance subsidiaries, held to maintain statutory equity levels and to provide liquidity to pay claims, totaled $657 million and $564 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $127 million and $121 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our facilities are insured by our insurance subsidiary for losses up to $80 million per occurrence ($110 million effective January 1, 2025); however, this coverage is subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. Net reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were $1.924 billion and $1.926 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate $543 million. We estimate that approximately $507 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.\n \nFinancing Activities\n \nWe have significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled $43.031 billion and $39.593 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our interest expense was $2.061 billion for 2024 and $1.938 billion for 2023.\n \nDuring 2024, we issued $4.500 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.450% senior notes due 2031 (the “Existing 2031 Notes”), (ii) $1.300 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.600% senior notes due 2034, (iii) $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.000% senior notes due 2054 and (iv) $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6.100% senior notes due 2064. We used the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. During 2024, we repaid all of the $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due 2024 at maturity.\n\n\n67\n\n\n\n\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\n \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\nFinancing Activities (continued)\nDuring 2024, we also issued $3.000 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of (i) $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.450% senior notes due 2031 (the “New 2031 Notes”), (ii) $1.250 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.450% senior notes due 2034 and (iii) $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.950% senior notes due 2054. The New 2031 Notes represent a further issuance of our Existing 2031 Notes, issued during February 2024, and together with the New 2031 Notes, the aggregate principal amount of these notes is $1.750 billion. We used the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nManagement believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.\n \nHCA Inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of HCA Healthcare, Inc., is the primary obligor under a substantial portion of our indebtedness, including our senior secured credit facilities and senior notes. The senior secured credit facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by substantially all existing and future, direct and indirect, 100% owned material domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” under our Indenture dated December 16, 1993 (except for certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility). During 2022, the conditions in the senior secured indentures to permit the permanent release of the subsidiary guarantees and all collateral securing the senior secured notes were met. The subsidiary guarantees and collateral securing our senior secured credit facilities were not affected. Following this release of the subsidiary guarantees and collateral securing the senior secured notes, summarized financial information for HCA Healthcare, Inc., HCA Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors, and information about the subsidiary guarantees and affiliates whose securities were pledged as collateral are no longer required to be presented.\nAll of the senior notes issued by HCA Inc. in 2014 or later are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by HCA Healthcare, Inc. The combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and HCA Inc. are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of HCA Healthcare, Inc. As a result, summarized financial information of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and HCA Inc. is not required to be presented under Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X.\nMarket Risk\n \nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. Our insurance subsidiaries held $657 million of investment securities at December 31, 2024. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses that are not credit-related being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2024, we had net unrealized losses of $27 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities.\n \nWe are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize credit-related impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.\n \nWe are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Debt of $1.238 billion at December 31, 2024 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining debt balance of $41.793 billion at December 31, 2024 was subject to fixed rates of interest. Both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. Our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. The average effective interest rate for our long-term debt was 5.0% for both 2024 and 2023.\n \n \n\n\n68\n\n\n\n\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\n \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\n \nMarket Risk (continued)\nThe estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $40.845 billion at December 31, 2024. The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $12 million. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.\n \nWe are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. We currently do not consider the market risk related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or our liquidity.\n \nTax Examinations\n \nDuring 2024, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) completed its examination of our 2016, 2017 and 2018 income tax returns, resolving all federal income tax matters for those years, and the 2020 federal statute of limitations expired. At December 31, 2024, the IRS was examining the Company’s 2022 and 2023 income tax returns and the 2019 income tax returns of certain affiliates. We are subject to examination by the IRS for tax years after 2020, as well as by state and foreign taxing authorities. Management believes HCA Healthcare, Inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities, and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our \nresults \nof operations or \nfinancial position. Howe\nv\ner\n, \nif payments due upon final resolution \nof any \nissues \nexceed our \nrecorded \nestimates\n, \nsuch resolutions could \nhave \na \nmaterial\n, \nadverse effect on our \nresults \nof operations or \nfinancial position\n.",
