MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, which we refer to as “MD&A,” should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in “Financial Information” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Form 10-Q”) and in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 25, 2025 (the “Form 10-K”), which we filed with the United States (“U.S.”) Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on July 23, 2025.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report, including the MD&A, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

We undertake no responsibility for updating these statements, except as required by law.\nOverview \nLamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” or “Lamb Weston”) is a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products. We are the number one supplier of value-added frozen potato products in North America and a leading supplier of value-added frozen potato products internationally, with a strong and growing presence in high-growth emerging markets. We offer a broad product portfolio to a diverse channel and customer base in over 100 countries. French fries represent the majority of our value-added frozen potato product portfolio.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThis MD&A is provided as a supplement to the consolidated financial statements and related condensed notes included elsewhere herein to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. Our MD&A is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We have also presented Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative expenses (“SG&A”), and Adjusted Income Tax Expense, each of which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, to supplement the financial information included in this report. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted SG&A, and Adjusted Income Tax Expense and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net income, gross profit, SG&A, or income tax expense, as applicable. For more information, refer to the “Results of Operations” and “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” sections below.\nExecutive Summary\nDuring the quarter, we saw volume growth and positive customer momentum. While the operating environment remains competitive, we believe our disciplined execution and strategic plans are better enabling us to expand our customer base and drive long-term growth. We are focused on executional excellence, including delivering our Cost Savings Program. Actions taken over the past two fiscal years have improved our manufacturing costs per pound and lowered SG&A. We are focused on strengthening customer partnerships and innovating across our business.\nOur operational improvements also drove favorable working capital changes, primarily from lower inventories. Operating cash flow and cash on hand increased at the end of the period, and capital expenditures declined as we near completion of our growth-related investments in our production facilities, with the startup of a new production facility in Argentina during the first quarter. \nOutlook\nIn fiscal 2026, we anticipate that global consumers will continue to face macroeconomic and geopolitical pressures, alongside a competitive environment, particularly in our international markets. We expect global restaurant traffic to remain roughly in line with fiscal 2025 levels. We believe customers and consumers will continue to prioritize french fries both on menus and at home. Momentum from customer wins in the second half of fiscal 2025 and the contribution of a 53rd week in fiscal 2026, with the additional week falling in the fourth quarter, is expected to drive increased sales volumes. \nWe expect earnings will decline as they are pressured by the impact of pricing and mix, higher overall input costs, net of the benefit of lower raw potato costs, incremental depreciation and start-up costs from the capacity expansions in the Netherlands and Argentina, and increased compensation and benefits as incentive programs normalize. These factors will only be partially offset by benefits from the Restructuring Plan and Cost Savings Program.\nOur outlook includes our current view of the anticipated impact of enacted tariffs by the U.S. and other governments but does not include the potential effects of evolving trade policies, including future changes in tariffs or retaliatory countermeasures.\n19\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations \nThirteen Weeks Ended August 24, 2025 compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended August 25, 2024\nNet Sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nThirteen Weeks Ended\n(in millions, except percentages)\nAugust 24,\n2025\nAugust 25,\n2024\n%\nIncrease (Decrease)\n% Increase (Decrease) at Constant Currency\nSegment net sales\nNorth America\n$\n1,084.6 \n$\n1,103.7 \n(2)%\n(2)%\nInternational\n574.7 \n550.4 \n4%\n—%\n$\n1,659.3 \n$\n1,654.1 \n—%\n(1)%\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nNorth America\n$\n260.0 \n$\n278.0 \n(6)%\n(6)%\nInternational\n57.2 \n51.4 \n11%\n4%\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 increased $5.2 million to $1,659.3 million compared to the prior year quarter, including a favorable foreign currency impact of $23.7 million. Net sales at constant currency declined 1% over the prior year quarter, as a 6% increase in volume was more than offset by a 7% decline in price/mix. Net sales and price/mix at constant currency are calculated by translating financial data for the current year period at prior year average exchange rates. Volume growth was driven by customer wins and retention, particularly in North America and Asia, as well as lapping an approximately $15 million charge in the prior year quarter related to a voluntary product withdrawal. Price/mix reflects the carryover impact of fiscal 2025 price and trade investments to support customers, ongoing price and trade support, and unfavorable channel product mix within our segments. \nNorth America segment net sales, which includes all sales to customers in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, declined $19.1 million, or 2%, to $1,084.6 million. Volume increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter supported by recent customer contract wins and growth across channels. Price/mix declined 7%, driven by the carryover impact from fiscal 2025 price investments, the ongoing support of customers through price and trade and an unfavorable channel mix.\nInternational segment net sales, which includes all sales to customers outside of North America, increased $24.3 million, or 4%, to $574.7 million year-over-year, including a favorable $24.5 million from foreign currency translation. Net sales at constant currency was flat. Volume increased 6%, led primarily by growth in Asia and with multinational chain customers. Price/mix at constant currency declined 6%, driven by investments to support customers as well as ongoing price and trade support.\nGross Profit\nGross profit declined $13.6 million versus the prior year quarter to $342.4 million. Adjusted Gross Profit declined $14.2 million versus the prior year quarter to $338.9 million due primarily to unfavorable price/mix. Unfavorable price/mix was partially offset by higher sales volumes, lower manufacturing costs per pound driven by cost savings initiatives, and the benefit of lapping an approximately $39 million charge in the prior year related to a voluntary product withdrawal.  \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A increased $9.7 million versus the prior year quarter to $153.6 million. Adjusted SG&A declined $24.0 million versus the prior year quarter to $132.4 million, reflecting the benefits of ongoing cost savings initiatives and $7.3 million of miscellaneous income primarily from an insurance recovery and property tax refunds.\n20\nTable of Contents\nNet Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income declined $63.1 million from the prior year quarter to $64.3 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $2.8 million versus the prior year quarter to $302.2 million. Lower Adjusted SG&A was partially offset by lower Adjusted Gross Profit and Equity Method Investment Earnings (Loss).\nNorth America Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased $18.0 million to $260.0 million. The decline primarily reflects price and trade investments in support of customers, partially offset by higher sales volumes, lower manufacturing costs per pound and Adjusted SG&A, which included the benefit of cost savings initiatives. Results also benefited from lapping an approximately $21 million charge related to a voluntary product withdrawal in the prior year.\nInternational Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $5.8 million to $57.2 million. For the quarter ended August 24, 2025, the effects of foreign currency translation to the International Segment Adjusted EBITDA were favorable by approximately $4 million. The increase was driven by higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs per pound. The improvement primarily reflects lapping an approximately $18 million charge related to the prior year’s voluntary product withdrawal, lower potato prices and benefits from ongoing cost savings initiatives. These benefits were partially offset by $3.5 million in start-up costs associated with the new production facility in Argentina, which is expected to support future growth. \nInterest Expense, Net \nInterest expense, net declined $1.5 million, versus the prior year quarter, to $43.7 million, reflecting the impact of lower total debt outstanding primarily driven by lower borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025 was $47.9 million and $50.8 million, respectively. The effective income tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 42.7% and 28.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively. The results in both periods reflect the impact of items outlined in “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we also recorded $10.2 million of discrete tax expense, primarily related to the establishment of a non-cash full valuation allowance against certain international deferred tax assets. Excluding the impact of these items, the Company’s effective tax rate was 30.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, versus 30.8% in the prior year quarter.\nOn July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”). Accounting Standards Codification 740, \nIncome Taxes\n, requires the effects of changes in tax rates and laws to be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. We currently anticipate a favorable cash tax timing benefit of approximately $35 million to $45 million in fiscal 2026 as of result of OBBBA; it is not expected to have a significant impact on our effective tax rate. \nEquity Method Investment Earnings (Loss)\nEquity method investment earnings (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures were a loss of $0.6 million and earnings of $11.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively. The decline in earnings was primarily the result of lower net sales and an unfavorable product mix. The results for the current and prior year quarters reflect earnings associated with our 50% interest in Lamb Weston/RDO Frozen, an unconsolidated potato processing joint venture in Minnesota. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nAs of August 24, 2025, we had $98.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, with $1,318.4 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our business requirements for at least the next 12 months.\n Cash generated by operations, supplemented by our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving \ncredit facility\n, are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our business requirements. Our funding requirements include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and shareholder returns, including cash dividends and repurchases under our share repurchase program.\n21\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows \nBelow is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of the sources and uses of cash through operating, investing, and financing activities: \nThirteen Weeks Ended\n(in millions)\nAugust 24,\n2025\nAugust 25,\n2024\nNet cash flows provided by (used for):\nOperating activities\n$\n352.0 \n$\n330.2 \nInvesting activities\n(76.3)\n(335.6)\nFinancing activities\n(248.5)\n52.2 \n27.2 \n46.8 \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n0.7 \n2.6 \nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n27.9 \n49.4 \nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n70.7 \n71.4 \nCash and cash equivalents, end of period\n$\n98.6 \n$\n120.8 \nOperating Activities\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026, cash provided by operating activities increased $21.8 million to $352.0 million. The increase largely relates to $18.7 million of favorable changes in working capital, led by lower North America finished goods inventories, compared to the last day of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used $76.3 million of cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, compared with $335.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 primarily related to our investments to expand our french fry capacity in Argentina and other production facility modernization efforts. Expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 primarily related to our investments to expand our french fry capacity in the Netherlands, the U.S., and Argentina. The expansion in the U.S. was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the expansion in the Netherlands was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and the expansion in Argentina was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we made net payments of $161.9 million under our revolving credit facilities. We used $18.7 million of cash to repurchase 187,259 shares of our common stock at an average price of $55.34 per share and to withhold 157,665 shares from employees to cover income and payroll taxes on equity awards that vested during the period. In addition, we paid $51.7 million in cash dividends to common stockholders during the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and repaid $16.2 million of debt and financing obligations.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we had net proceeds of $203.6 million under our revolving credit facility which were primarily used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, funding capital expenditures and working capital requirements. We used $92.2 million of cash to repurchase 1,412,852 shares of our common stock at an average price of $58.04 per share and withheld 178,941 shares from employees to cover income and payroll taxes on equity awards that vested during the period. In addition, we paid $51.7 million in cash dividends to common stockholders and repaid $10.2 million of debt and financing obligations.\nFor more information about our debt, see Note 10, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements” of this report and Note 8, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of the Form 10-K. At August 24, 2025, we were in compliance with the financial covenant ratios and other covenants contained in our debt agreements.\n22\nTable of Contents\nObligations and Commitments \nThere have been no material changes to the contractual obligations disclosed in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Form 10-K.\nSee Note 10, Debt and Financing Obligations, of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements” of this report for more information.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \nTo supplement the financial information included in this report, we have presented Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted Income Tax Expense, and net sales, price/mix and Segment Adjusted EBITDA at constant currency, each of which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Net sales, price/mix and Segment Adjusted EBITDA growth at constant currency provide information on the percentage change in net sales, price/mix and Segment Adjusted EBITDA growth, respectively, as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant between the prior and current periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in analyzing what management views as our core operating performance for purposes of business decision making. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with useful supplemental information because they (i) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding impacts of foreign currency exchange translation and unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains and losses and other items affecting comparability between periods, (ii) permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate our core operating performance across periods, and (iii) otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our financial results. In addition, we believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and the reconciliations to those GAAP financial measures, provides investors with additional tools to understand the factors and trends affecting our underlying business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report should be viewed in addition to, and not as alternatives for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP that are also presented in this report. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income, gross profit, SG&A, income tax expense, net sales, or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. For example, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures the same way we do.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA:\nThirteen Weeks Ended\n(in millions)\nAugust 24,\n2025\nAugust 25,\n2024\nNet income (a)\n$\n64.3 \n$\n127.4 \nInterest expense, net\n43.7 \n45.2 \nIncome tax expense\n47.9 \n50.8 \nIncome from operations including equity method investment earnings\n155.9 \n223.4 \nDepreciation and amortization (b)\n96.3 \n91.4 \nUnrealized derivative gains\n(4.9)\n(8.9)\nForeign currency exchange (gains) losses\n(4.7)\n0.6 \nBlue chip swap transaction gains (c)\n— \n(16.6)\nStock-based compensation\n10.6 \n9.5 \nItems impacting comparability:\nCost Savings Program, Restructuring Plan, and other expenses (d)\n31.9 \n— \nShareholder activism expense (e)\n4.0 \n— \nPension settlement (f)\n13.1 \n— \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n302.2 \n$\n299.4 \n___________________________________________\n(a)\nNet income during the thirteen weeks ended August 25, 2024, reflects an approximately $39 million ($30 million after-tax, or $0.21 per share) charge related to a voluntary product withdrawal initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.
