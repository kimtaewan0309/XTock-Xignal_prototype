Industry overcapacity due to newer entrants exporting at anti-competitive economics has, and is expected to continue to, negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the current uncertain geopolitical environment, including the impact of trade policies, has resulted in increased volatility in global markets, also negatively impacting the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. The macroeconomic conditions experienced in the first nine months of 2025 are expected to persist in the near term for the Company and the industry alike.\nDespite these challenges, the Company has maintained a strong financial position and solid liquidity and has taken actions to mitigate impacts on its supply chain and results of operations. At the time of this filing, the ultimate impact of tariff policies and other evolving global trade measures, coupled with existing macroeconomic challenges, is uncertain. The Company is actively monitoring global trade developments to identify actions necessary to maintain competitiveness while it adapts to these new economic challenges and continuing to work with regulatory bodies to address anti-competitive behavior. More information on these risks and potential impact to the Company can be found in Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Dow announced targeted cost actions to reduce structural costs by $1 billion over the next two years, while its businesses work to balance supply with profitable demand. The cost actions target areas such as third-party spending and include a workforce reduction of approximately 1,500 roles. The Company also announced reductions to its capital expenditures for 2025.\nThe Company announced further actions to address ongoing macroeconomic volatility and persistently slower global GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025, including the decision to delay construction of its Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada, until market conditions improve, reducing the Company’s expected 2025 enterprise-wide capital expenditures to $2.5 billion, a reduction from the Company's original plan of $3.5 billion. Dow remains committed to its Path2Zero project and the growth upside it will enable in targeted applications like pressure pipe, wire and cable, and food packaging. The Path2Zero project is expected to be the world’s first net-zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions integrated ethylene and derivatives complex.\nOn July 7, 2025, the Company announced additional restructuring actions, approved by its Board of Directors (\"Board\") on June 30, 2025, to rationalize its global asset footprint, including actions related to the three assets identified as part of the Company’s expanded strategic review of its European assets and certain corporate and other assets, and to enhance the Company’s competitiveness over the economic cycle. The program includes asset \n45\nTable of Contents\nwrite-down and write-off charges, severance and related benefit costs, contract termination fees and other exit and disposal costs. These actions will be completed by the Company primarily over the next four years, including the asset shut downs and completion of the related decommissioning and demolition activities. Significant actions approved to date include the following:\n•\nPackaging & Specialty Plastics will shut down an ethylene facility in Böhlen, Germany by the end of 2027.\n•\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure will shut down chlor-alkali and vinyl assets in Schkopau, Germany by the end of 2027.\n•\nPerformance Materials & Coatings will shut down a basics siloxanes plant in Barry, United Kingdom by mid-year 2026.\n•\nThe Company will write-off certain Corporate-aligned owned and leased non-manufacturing facilities and other assets.\nMore information on the restructuring actions and related charges can be found in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn July 24, 2025, the Company’s Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, reducing the dividend by 50 percent compared with the dividend declared in second quarter 2025, in response to the prolonged industry downturn. The adjustment to the size of the dividend reflects the Company’s balanced capital allocation approach and enhances financial flexibility amidst a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment. The Company's fourth quarter dividend of $0.35 per share was declared by the Board on October 9, 2025.\nOutlook\nThe Company is staying close with its customers, maintaining the financial flexibility it has built, and strengthening its competitiveness to drive higher earnings. While the near-term market backdrop remains largely unchanged across the end markets Dow serves, the Company continues to take actions to build on its strong foundation and enable greater long-term shareholder returns when macroeconomic conditions improve. Dow is focused on resilient areas of its portfolio where it can capture share and premiums. And, the Company is delivering increased cost savings, rationalizing higher-cost areas of its asset footprint, primarily in Europe, and applying a disciplined approach to its balance sheet and cash flow. As it has demonstrated, Dow is committed to identifying and implementing additional targeted initiatives designed to enhance its earnings and further optimize its cost structure.\nOVERVIEW\nThe following is a summary of the results for the three months ended September 30, 2025:\n•\nThe Company reported net sales in the third quarter of 2025 of $10.0 billion, down 8 percent from $10.9 billion in the third quarter of 2024, and down in all operating segments; Packaging & Specialty Plastics (down 11 percent), Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure (down 4 percent) and Performance Materials & Coatings (down 6 percent).

COS decreased in the third quarter of 2025 primarily due to lower raw material, feedstock and energy costs, lower planned maintenance turnaround spending, the impact of the Company's cost reduction initiatives and the absence of a charge in the third quarter of 2024 related to an arbitration settlement agreement for historical product claims from a divested business. For the first nine months of 2025, COS was $28.5 billion, compared with $28.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024. COS for the first nine months of 2025 decreased primarily due to lower raw material, feedstock and energy costs, lower planned maintenance turnaround spending, adjustments to legacy groundwater contamination matters and the absence of a charge in the third quarter of 2024 related to an arbitration settlement agreement for historical product claims from a divested business. COS as a percentage of net sales was 92.7 percent in the third quarter of 2025 (90.2 percent in the third quarter of 2024) and 93.5 percent for the first nine months of 2025 (88.7 percent for the first nine months of 2024).\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses totaled $191 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared with $208 million in the third quarter of 2024.

For the first nine months of 2025, SG&A expenses were $1,053 million, compared with\n \n$1,228 million in the first nine months of 2024. SG&A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 decreased primarily due to the impact of lower third-party purchased services, the impact of the Company's cost reduction initiatives, as well as decreased bad debt expense. The first nine months of 2025 also included the impact of a favorable resolution of a dispute with a customer.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangibles was $46 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared with $76 million in the third quarter of 2024. In the first nine months of 2025, amortization of intangibles was $185 million, compared with $234 million in the first nine months of 2024. Amortization of intangibles decreased primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2025.\nRestructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net\n2025 Restructuring Program\nOn January 27, 2025, the Board approved targeted actions to further achieve the Company's cost reduction initiatives in response to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, while reinforcing its long-term competitiveness across the economic cycle. As a result of these actions, in the first quarter of 2025 the Company recorded pretax charges of $207 million\n \nfor severance and related benefits costs, related to Corporate. These actions are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2026.\nOn June 30, 2025, the Board approved restructuring actions to rationalize the Company's global asset footprint, including certain actions identified as part of the Company's previously announced strategic review of its European assets and certain corporate and other assets, and to enhance the Company's competitiveness over the economic cycle. The program includes asset write-down and write-off charges, severance and related benefit costs and other exit and disposal costs. As a result of these actions, in the second quarter of 2025 the Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $591 million, consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $154 million, asset write-downs and write-offs of $334 million and costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $103 million.

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nThe Company's share of equity in losses of nonconsolidated affiliates was $72 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared with equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates of $2 million in the third quarter of 2024. The Company's share of equity in losses of nonconsolidated affiliates was $122 million for the first nine months of 2025, compared with equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates of $45 million for the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in both periods was primarily driven by lower results at the Company's Thai, Kuwait and Sadara joint ventures. Cash dividends from nonconsolidated affiliates were $190 million for the first nine months of 2025, compared with $266 million for the first nine months of 2024.\nSundry Income (Expense) – Net\nSundry income (expense) - net for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was income of $185 million and $184 million for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively, compared with income of $119 million and $118 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The third quarter of 2025 included a gain from the divestiture of the Company's ownership interest in DowAksa, non-operating pension and postretirement benefit plan credits and foreign currency exchange gains, partially offset by a loss on early extinguishment of debt. The third quarter of 2024 included non-operating pension and postretirement benefit plan credits, gains on the sales of assets and investments and foreign currency exchange losses. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSundry income (expense) - net for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was income of $345 million and $360 million for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively, compared with income of $256 million and $253 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The first nine months of 2025 included a gain from the divestiture of the Company's soil fumigation product line and its ownership interest in DowAksa, non-operating pension and postretirement benefit plan credits, and foreign currency exchange gains, partially offset by a loss on early extinguishment of debt.

See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nInterest Expense and Amortization of Debt Discount\nInterest expense and amortization of debt discount was $221 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared with $199 million in the third quarter of 2024. Interest expense and amortization of debt discount was $646 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared with $595 million in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased issuances of commercial paper during the first nine months of 2025. See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nProvision (Credit) for Income Taxes\nThe Company's effective tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, where income is earned, the level of income relative to tax attributes and the level of equity earnings, since most earnings from the Company's equity method investments are taxed at the joint venture level. In the third quarter of 2025, the Company reported a credit for income taxes of $54 million, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of 77.1 percent. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of $84 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.9 percent and 25.1 percent for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively. For the first nine months of 2025, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of $4 million, resulting in a negative effective tax rate of 0.4 percent. For the first nine months of 2024, the Company reported a provision for income taxes of $145 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 10.5 percent and 10.4 percent for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively. \nThe credit for income taxes for the third quarter of 2025 was impacted by the recording of a tax benefit stemming from the U.S. Tax Court's decision in \nVarian Medical Systems Inc. v. Commissioner\n of $100 million and a tax benefit of $20 million related to the sale of an additional portion of the Company's membership interests in Diamond Infrastructure Solutions, partially offset by losses attributable to jurisdictions for which no tax benefit can be recognized. The provision for income taxes for the first nine months of 2025 was also impacted by the initial sale of \n50\nTable of Contents\na portion of the Company's membership interests in Diamond Infrastructure Solutions resulting in a tax benefit of $89 million, which was offset by valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions of $242 million. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Diamond Infrastructure Solutions transaction. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a tax credit of $194 million related to a reassessment of interest and penalties on a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024.\nThe Company continues to monitor and evaluate legislative developments related to the Global Anti-Base Erosion Proposal Regime (\"GloBE\") established by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development’s (\"OECD\") Pillar Two framework. Several countries in which the Company operates have adopted GloBE into their legislation and several others are expected to enact these rules in the future. To date, such legislation has not materially impacted the Company's effective tax rate.\nOn July 4, 2025, U.S. legislation formally titled \"An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Title II of H. Con. Res. 14” (“the Act”) and commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law. The Act, among other things, extended key provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and introduced targeted changes to the U.S. federal income tax regime. Based on the analysis performed by the Company to date, the Act is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $62 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared with $26 million in the third quarter of 2024. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $113 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared with $67 million for the first nine months of 2024. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily driven by the initial sale of 40 percent of the membership interests of Diamond Infrastructure Solutions in the second quarter of 2025 and the sale of an additional 9 percent in the third quarter of 2025. See Notes 17 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNet Income (Loss) Available for Common Stockholder(s)\nDow Inc.\nNet income (loss) available for Dow Inc. common stockholders was income of $62 million, or $0.08 per share, in the third quarter of 2025, compared with income of $214 million, or $0.30 per share, in the third quarter of 2024. Net income (loss) available for Dow Inc. common stockholders was a loss of $1,080 million, or $1.53 per share, in the first nine months of 2025, compared with income of $1,169 million, or $1.65 per share, in the first nine months of 2024. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on Dow Inc.'s earnings per share calculations.\nTDCC\nNet income (loss) available for the TDCC common stockholder was income of $62 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared with income of $224 million in the third quarter of 2024. Net income (loss) available for the TDCC common stockholder was a loss of $1,059 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared with income of $1,186 million in the first nine months of 2024. TDCC's common shares are owned solely by Dow Inc.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nFor further discussion of the Company's segments, see Part I, Item 1. Business of the combined Dow Inc. and TDCC Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (\"2024 10-K\"), filed with the SEC on February 4, 2025.\nDow’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is Operating EBIT as this is the manner in which the chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, general counsel and corporate secretary, and senior vice president of corporate development, together the \"executive committee\" and chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), assesses performance and allocates resources. The CODM compares quarterly results to both the year-ago and sequential periods to assess performance and allocate resources to each segment. The Company defines Operating EBIT as earnings (i.e., \"Income (loss) before income taxes\") before interest, excluding the impact of significant items. Operating EBIT by segment includes all operating items relating to the businesses; items that principally apply to Dow as a whole are assigned to Corporate. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliations of these measures.\n51\nTable of Contents\nPACKAGING & SPECIALTY PLASTICS\nPackaging & Specialty Plastics\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nIn millions\nSep 30, 2025\nSep 30, 2024\nSep 30, 2025\nSep 30, 2024\nNet sales\n$\n4,891 \n$\n5,516 \n$\n15,226 \n$\n16,461 \nOperating EBIT\n$\n199 \n$\n618 \n$\n612 \n$\n1,926 \nEquity earnings (losses)\n$\n(6)\n$\n16 \n$\n40 \n$\n96 \nPackaging & Specialty Plastics\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nPercentage change from prior year\nSep 30, 2025\nSep 30, 2025\nChange in Net Sales from Prior Period due to:\nLocal price & product mix\n(10)\n%\n(8)\n%\nCurrency\n1 \n— \nVolume\n(1)\n1 \nPortfolio & other \n1\n(1)\n(1)\nTotal\n(11)\n%\n(8)\n%\n1.\nPortfolio & other includes the sales impact of the flexible packaging laminating adhesives business, which was sold to Arkema S.A. in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nPackaging & Specialty Plastics net sales were $4,891 million in the third quarter of 2025, down 11 percent from net sales of $5,516 million in the third quarter of 2024, with local price down 10 percent, both volume and portfolio & other down 1 percent and currency up 1 percent. Local price decreased in Packaging and Specialty Plastics in all geographic regions, driven by lower pricing of polyethylene and functional polymers. Local price decreased in Hydrocarbons & Energy, driven by olefins and aromatics in EMEAI and the U.S. & Canada. Volume decreased in Packaging and Specialty Plastics due to nonrecurring licensing sales in the year ago period, partially offset by higher polyethylene volumes.

Local price decreased in both businesses and across all geographic regions, led by declines in industrial and building and construction applications. Volume increased in Industrial Solutions, driven by higher volumes from improved supply availability following planned maintenance activity and the startup of a new alkoxylation unit in Seadrift, Texas, and was led by energy applications. Volume was flat in Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals as increased methylene diphenyl diisocyanate volumes following a third-party supplier outage in the prior year were offset by declines in consumer durables applications.

Operating EBIT was a loss of $144 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared with a loss of $160 million in the first nine months of 2024. Operating EBIT improved primarily due to lower environmental costs.\nCHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $4,609 million at September 30, 2025 and $2,189 million at December 31, 2024, of which $2,335 million at September 30, 2025 and $1,427 million at December 31, 2024 was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including U.S. territories. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, Dow makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States.\nCash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. Dow has the ability to repatriate additional funds to the United States, which could result in an adjustment to the tax liability for foreign withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes and the impact of foreign currency movements. At September 30, 2025, management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the United States. The Company has and expects to continue repatriating certain funds from its non‑U.S. subsidiaries that are not needed to finance local operations; however, these particular repatriation activities have not and are not expected to result in a significant incremental tax liability to the Company.\nThe Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:\nCash Flow Summary\nDow Inc.\nTDCC\nNine Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSep 30, 2025\nSep 30, 2024\nSep 30, 2025\nSep 30, 2024\nIn millions\nCash provided by (used for):\nOperating activities - continuing operations\n$\n764 \n$\n2,092 \n$\n746 \n$\n2,116 \nOperating activities - discontinued operations\n(16)\n8 \n— \n— \nOperating activities\n$\n748 \n$\n2,100 \n$\n746 \n$\n2,116 \nInvesting activities\n$\n(1,457)\n$\n(1,456)\n$\n(1,457)\n$\n(1,456)\nFinancing activities\n$\n2,941 \n$\n(723)\n$\n2,943 \n$\n(739)\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in the first nine months of 2025 was primarily driven by the Company's cash earnings, advance payments received from customers related to long-term supply contracts and dividends from equity method investments, partially offset by cash used for working capital and performance-based compensation. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by the Company's cash earnings and dividends from equity method investments, which were partially offset by cash used for working capital and performance-based compensation payments.\n55\nTable of Contents\nNet Working Capital\nDow Inc.\nTDCC\nSep 30, 2025\nDec 31, 2024\nSep 30, 2025\nDec 31, 2024\nIn millions\nCurrent assets\n$\n19,646 \n$\n16,590 \n$\n19,610 \n$\n16,565 \nCurrent liabilities\n10,104 \n10,288 \n9,986 \n10,210 \nNet working capital\n$\n9,542 \n$\n6,302 \n$\n9,624 \n$\n6,355 \nCurrent ratio\n1.94:1\n1.61:1\n1.96:1\n1.62:1\nWorking Capital Metrics\nThree Months Ended\nSep 30, 2025\nJun 30, 2025\nSep 30, 2024\nDays sales outstanding in trade receivables\n48 \n47 \n44 \nDays sales in inventory\n67 \n64 \n62 \nDays payables outstanding\n64 \n64 \n64 \nCash provided by (used for) operating activities from discontinued operations in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024 reflected cash payments and receipts for certain agreements and matters related to the separation from DowDuPont Inc. (\"DowDuPont\").\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used for investing activities in the first nine months of 2025 and 2024 was primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of investments, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. The first nine months of 2025 also included a cash inflow related to the sale of the soil fumigation product line and certain related assets, proceeds from incentives related to capital expenditures and the divestiture of the Company's ownership interest in DowAksa. The first nine months of 2024 also included the acquisition of Circulus Holdings, PBLLC, a U.S. mechanical recycling company.\nThe Company's capital expenditures were $1,911 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared with $2,173 million in the first nine months of 2024. The Company has reduced its expected full year capital spending to approximately $2.5 billion. The primary driver for the decrease is the Company’s decision to delay construction of the Fort Saskatchewan Path2Zero project until market conditions improve. As evidenced across this and prior economic cycles, the Company will proactively adjust its spending as economic conditions evolve.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2025 was primarily related to proceeds from the sale of a minority stake in the Company's consolidated infrastructure entity and proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, which were partially offset by payments on long-term debt. In addition, Dow Inc. included cash outflows for dividends paid to stockholders, including the impact of a 50 percent reduction to dividends paid in the third quarter of 2025, and TDCC included cash outflows for dividends paid to Dow Inc. Cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 for Dow Inc. was primarily related to dividends paid to stockholders, purchases of treasury stock and payments on long-term debt, which were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of long-term debt. Cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 for TDCC was primarily related to dividends paid to Dow Inc. and payments on long-term debt, which were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of long-term debt.\nDow Inc. Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures\nFree Cash Flow \nDow defines Free Cash Flow as \"Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations,\" less capital expenditures. Under this definition, Free Cash Flow represents the cash generated by Dow from operations after investing in its asset base. Free Cash Flow, combined with cash balances and other sources of liquidity, represents the cash available to fund obligations and provide returns to shareholders. Free Cash Flow is an integral financial measure used in the Company's financial planning process.\nOperating EBITDA\nDow defines Operating EBITDA as earnings (i.e., \"Income (loss) before income taxes\") before interest, depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact of significant items.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCash Flow Conversion (Cash Flow from Operations to Operating EBITDA)\nDow defines Cash Flow Conversion (Cash Flow from Operations to Operating EBITDA) as \"Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations,\" divided by Operating EBITDA. Management believes Cash Flow Conversion is an important financial metric as it helps the Company determine how efficiently it is converting its earnings into cash flow.\nThese financial measures are not recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP financial measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, Dow's definitions may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies.\nReconciliation of Free Cash Flow\nNine Months Ended\nSep 30, 2025\nSep 30, 2024\nIn millions\nCash provided by operating activities - continuing operations (GAAP)\n$\n764 \n$\n2,092 \nCapital expenditures\n(1,911)\n(2,173)\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\n$\n(1,147)\n$\n(81)\nReconciliation of Cash Flow Conversion (Cash Flow from Operations to Operating EBITDA)\nNine Months Ended\nSep 30, 2025\nSep 30, 2024\nIn millions\nNet income (loss) (GAAP)\n$\n(967)\n$\n1,236\n+ Provision for income taxes\n4\n145\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n$\n(963)\n$\n1,381\n-  Interest income\n114\n143\n+ Interest expense and amortization of debt discount\n646\n595\n-  Significant items ¹\n(820)\n(301)\nOperating EBIT (non-GAAP)\n$\n389\n$\n2,134\n+ Depreciation and amortization\n2,126\n2,143\nOperating EBITDA (non-GAAP)\n$\n2,515\n$\n4,277\nCash provided by operating activities - continuing operations (GAAP)\n$\n764\n$\n2,092\nCash flow from operations to net income (GAAP) \n2\nN/A\n169.3 \n%\nCash Flow Conversion (Cash flow from operations to Operating EBITDA) (non-GAAP)\n30.4 \n%\n48.9 \n%\n1.\nThe nine months ended September 30, 2025 includes: severance and related benefit costs, costs associated with exit and disposal activities and impairment charges related to the 2025 Restructuring Program; implementation costs associated with the Company's 2025 Restructuring Program and the sale of membership interests of Diamond Infrastructure Solutions; a gain on the sale of the soil fumigation product line and divestiture of ownership interest in DowAksa; a gain associated with the reassessment of liabilities for certain accrued Groundwater Matters, partially offset by the settlement of a separate claim related to Groundwater Matters; charges associated with agreements entered into with DuPont de Nemours, Inc. and Corteva, Inc. as part of the separation and distribution; charges related to an arbitration agreement for historical product claims from a divested business; a loss on early extinguishment of debt; restructuring charges and implementation and efficiency costs associated with the Company's 2023 Restructuring Program. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes restructuring charges and implementation and efficiency costs associated with the Company's 2023 Restructuring Program and impairment charges related to write-downs of certain manufacturing assets. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n2.\nCash flow from operations to net income is not applicable for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 due to a net loss for the period.\nLiquidity & Financial Flexibility\nThe Company’s primary source of incremental liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. The generation of cash from operations over the economic cycle and the Company's ability to access capital markets is expected to meet the Company’s cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, debt maturities, contributions to pension plans, dividend distributions to stockholders, share repurchases and other needs. In addition to cash from operating activities, the Company’s current liquidity sources also include TDCC's U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, committed accounts receivable facilities, a medium-term notes program, a U.S. retail note program (“InterNotes®”) and other debt markets.\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe Company continues to maintain a strong financial position with all of its committed credit facilities undrawn and fully available at September 30, 2025. Cash and committed and available forms of liquidity were $14.5 billion at September 30, 2025. The Company also has no substantive long-term debt maturities due until 2027. As a well-known seasoned issuer, the Company has ready access to debt capital markets, subject to market conditions, as an additional source of liquidity. Additional details on sources of liquidity are as follows:\nCommercial Paper\nTDCC issues promissory notes under its U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs. TDCC had no commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2025. TDCC maintains access to the commercial paper market at competitive rates.\n \nAmounts outstanding under TDCC's commercial paper programs during the period may be greater or less than the amount reported at the end of the period. TDCC did not issue commercial paper subsequent to September 30, 2025.\nCommitted Credit Facilities\nThe Company also has the ability to access liquidity through TDCC's committed and available credit facilities. At September 30, 2025, TDCC had total committed and available credit facilities of $8.4 billion. \nUncommitted Credit Facilities\nThe Company has entered into various uncommitted bilateral credit arrangements as a potential source of excess liquidity. These lines can be used to support short-term liquidity needs and for general purposes. The Company had no drawdowns outstanding at September 30, 2025.\nAccounts Receivable Securitization Facilities\nIn addition to the above credit facilities, the Company maintains a committed accounts receivable facility in the United States where eligible trade accounts receivable, up to $900 million, may be sold at any point in time. The Company also maintains a committed accounts receivable facility in Europe where eligible trade accounts receivable, up to €500 million, may be sold at any point in time. These facilities are set to expire in November 2025 and are expected to be renewed in the fourth quarter. In the first nine months of 2025, there were $106 million in sales of receivables under the U.S. and Europe committed accounts receivable facilities ($289 million in sales of receivables in the first nine\n \nmonths of 2024). No sold receivables were outstanding with the facilities at September 30, 2025.\nIn addition, the Company has an uncommitted accounts receivable facility in the United States providing additional liquidity. This facility is set to expire in November 2025 and is expected to be renewed in the fourth quarter. Sales of receivables under this facility were $147 million in the first nine months of 2025 ($378 million in sales of receivables in the first nine months of 2024). No sold receivables were outstanding with the facility at September 30, 2025. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nEarly Settlement of Letters of Credit\nThe Company utilizes, from time-to-time, letters of credit discounting programs to manage and expedite the settlement of letters of credit in certain regions. These letters of credit are associated with accounts receivable and the Company retains no interest in the transferred letters of credit or receivables once sold.\nAccounts Receivable Discounting Facilities\nThe Company has access to accounts receivable discounting facilities, under which receivables are transferred with limited recourse. The Company retains no interest in the transferred receivables once sold. Sales of receivables under this facility were $285 million in the first nine months of 2025 ($581 million sales of receivables in the first nine months of 2024). At September 30, 2025, approximately $6 million\n \nof sold receivables were outstanding. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Company maintains these facilities and also participates in certain customers’ supply chain financing and other early pay programs as a routine source of working capital. \nCompany-Owned Life Insurance\nThe Company has investments in company-owned life insurance (\"COLI\") policies, which are recorded at their cash surrender value as of each balance sheet date. The Company has the ability to monetize its investment in its COLI policies as an additional source of liquidity. At September 30, 2025, the Company had monetized $197 million of its existing COLI policies' surrender value (zero at December 31, 2024). See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n58\nTable of Contents\nShelf Registration - U.S. \nOn June 13, 2025, Dow Inc. and TDCC filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The shelf indicates that Dow Inc. may offer common stock; preferred stock; depositary shares; debt securities; guarantees; warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock and debt securities; and stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units, with pricing and availability of any such offerings depending on market conditions.

On July 25, 2025, TDCC filed a prospectus supplement under this shelf registration to register an undetermined amount of securities for issuance under InterNotes®. Also, on July 25, 2025, TDCC filed a prospectus supplement under this shelf registration to register an undetermined amount of securities for issuance under a medium-term notes program.\nDebt\nAs the Company continues to maintain its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, management is focused on net debt (a non-GAAP financial measure), as the Company believes this is the best representation of its financial leverage at this point in time.

TDCC's most significant debt covenant with regard to its financial position is the obligation to maintain the ratio of its consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization at no greater than 0.70 to 1.00 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under the Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (\"Revolving Credit Agreement\") equals or exceeds $500 million. The ratio of TDCC's consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement was 0.46 to 1.00 at September 30, 2025. Management believes TDCC was in compliance with all of its covenants and default provisions at September 30, 2025. For information on TDCC's debt covenants and default provisions, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2024 10-K. There were no material changes to the debt covenants and default provisions related to TDCC’s outstanding long-term debt and primary, private credit agreements in the first nine months of 2025.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, the Company completed debt neutral liability management activities. The Company issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes. The offering included $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.35 percent notes due 2035 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes due 2055. The Company used the proceeds to complete cash tender offers for certain debt securities. In total, $943 million aggregate principal amount was tendered and retired. As a result, the Company recognized a pretax loss of \n59\nTable of Contents\n$60 million on the early extinguishment of debt, included in \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" in the consolidated statements of income, related to Corporate.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the Company issued $1.4 billion of senior unsecured notes. The offering included $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.80 percent notes due 2031 and $650 million aggregate principal amount of 5.65 percent notes due 2036. Additionally, the Company redeemed $55 million aggregate principal amount of 9.40 percent notes due 2039. As a result of the redemption, the Company recognized a pretax loss of $18 million on the early extinguishment of debt, included in \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" in the consolidated statements of income, related to Corporate.\nIn the first nine months of 2025, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount of $252 million of InterNotes\n®\n. Additionally, the Company repaid $125 million of long-term debt at maturity.\nWhile taking into consideration the current economic environment, management expects that the Company will continue to have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet all of its business obligations.\nCredit Ratings\nAt September 30, 2025, TDCC's credit ratings were as follows:\nCredit Ratings\nLong-Term Rating \nShort-Term Rating\nOutlook\nFitch Ratings\nBBB\nF2\nStable\nMoody’s Ratings\nBaa2\nP-2\nNegative\nStandard & Poor’s\nBBB\nA-2\nNegative\nOn February 21, 2025, Standard & Poor's affirmed TDCC's BBB and A-2 rating, and revised its outlook to negative from stable. Standard & Poor's decision was made as part of their annual review process and reflects the Company's supportive financial policies, scale, liquidity and cost-advantaged footprint. \nOn July 7, 2025, Moody's Ratings announced a long-term credit rating change for TDCC from Baa1 to Baa2 and affirmed TDCC's P-2 rating and its outlook of negative. On July 31, 2025, Fitch Ratings announced a long-term credit rating change for TDCC from BBB+ to BBB and a short-term credit rating change from F1 to F2, with its outlook remaining stable. The credit rating agencies' decisions were made to reflect the impact of current market conditions on the Company's operating results and cash flow, including the impact of global trade policy uncertainty and capacity additions in the industry, while recognizing the Company's strong asset base, strategic cost actions and long-term commitment to maintaining investment-grade quality.\nDividends\nDow Inc.\nDow Inc. has paid dividends on a quarterly basis since the separation from DowDuPont and expects to continue to do so, subject to approval by the Board. On July 24, 2025, the Company announced a 50 percent reduction to its quarterly dividend. The following table summarizes dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of record in 2025:\nDow Inc. Dividends Declared and Paid\nDeclaration Date\nRecord Date\nPayment Date\nAmount (per share)\nFebruary 13, 2025\nFebruary 28, 2025\nMarch 14, 2025\n$\n0.70 \nApril 10, 2025\nMay 30, 2025\nJune 13, 2025\n$\n0.70 \nJuly 24, 2025\nAugust 29, 2025\nSeptember 12, 2025\n$\n0.35 \nOctober 9, 2025\nNovember 28, 2025\nDecember 12, 2025\n$\n0.35 \nTDCC\nTDCC has committed to fund Dow Inc.'s dividends paid to common stockholders and share repurchases, as approved by the Board, as well as certain governance expenses. Funding is accomplished through intercompany loans. TDCC's Board reviews and determines a dividend distribution to Dow Inc. to settle the intercompany loans. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, TDCC declared a dividend of $240 million and paid a dividend of $252 million to Dow Inc. ($1,225 million of dividend declared and $1,237 million of dividend paid for the nine months \n60\nTable of Contents\nended September 30, 2025). At September 30, 2025, TDCC's intercompany loan balance with Dow Inc. was insignificant.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn April 13, 2022, the Board approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $3 billion for the repurchase of the Company's common stock, with no expiration date. The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock in the third quarter of 2025 (zero in the first nine months of 2025). At September 30, 2025, approximately $931 million of the share repurchase program authorization remained available for repurchases. As previously announced, the Company intends to repurchase shares at a minimum to cover dilution over the economic cycle. The Company may from time to time expand its share repurchases beyond dilution, based on a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions, free cash flow generation, and the Dow share price. Any share repurchases, when coupled with the Company's dividends, are intended to implement the long-term strategy of targeting shareholder remuneration of approximately 65 percent of Operating Net Income over the economic cycle.\nPension Plans\nThe Company has both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover employees in the United States and a number of other countries. The Company's funding policy is to contribute to funded plans when pension laws and/or economics either require or encourage funding.\nAs part of its ongoing pension derisking initiatives, the Company initiated the termination of certain U.S. tax-qualified pension plans which include the tax-qualified benefit obligations for substantially all employees hired after January 1, 2008, who earned benefits based on a set percentage of annual pay, plus interest. As part of the plan termination process, the Company offered participants of these plans annuity or lump sum distribution options. Final asset distributions are expected to be paid from plan assets in the fourth quarter of 2025. The Company is also pursuing other pension derisking opportunities, including annuitization and risk transfer of certain other pension liabilities. These actions, if executed and inclusive of the termination of certain U.S. tax-qualified pension plans discussed above, are expected to result in non-operating and non-cash settlement charges in the range of $275 million to $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nSee Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2024 10-K for additional information related to the Company's pension plans.\nRestructuring\nThe 2025 Restructuring Program is expected to result in additional cash expenditures of approximately $650 million primarily over the next four years and consist primarily of severance and related benefits costs, implementation costs related to decommissioning and demolition and additional costs associated with exit and disposal activities. Restructuring implementation costs totaled $5 million and $10 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nRestructuring implementation and efficiency costs related to the 2023 Restructuring Program were zero and $50 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively ($55 million and $157 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively).\nThe Company expects to incur additional costs in the future related to its restructuring activities, which will be recognized as incurred. The Company also expects to incur additional employee-related costs, including involuntary termination benefits related to its other optimization activities. These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's restructuring activities.\n61\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nInformation related to the Company’s contractual obligations, commercial commitments and expected cash requirements for interest can be found in Notes 14, 15, 16 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2024 10-K. With the exception of the items noted below, there have been no material changes in the Company’s contractual obligations since December 31, 2024.\nContractual Obligations at Sep 30, 2025\nPayments Due In\nIn millions\n2025\n2026-2027\n2028-2029\n2030 and beyond\nTotal\nDow Inc.\nLong-term debt obligations \n1\n$\n245 \n$\n989 \n$\n1,811 \n$\n15,308 \n$\n18,353 \nExpected cash requirements for interest \n2\n271 \n1,733 \n1,626 \n10,173 \n13,803 \nOperating leases \n3\n102 \n666 \n384 \n481 \n1,633 \nPurchase obligations \n4\n706 \n4,721 \n3,667 \n15,983 \n25,077 \nTotal\n$\n1,324 \n$\n8,109 \n$\n7,488 \n$\n41,945 \n$\n58,866 \n1.\nExcludes unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $231 million.

The increase from December 31, 2024 was primarily due to supply agreements related to the Company's Fort Saskatchewan Path2Zero project and contract term extensions.\nFair Value Measurements\nSee Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning fair value measurements.\nOTHER MATTERS\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2024 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s critical accounting policies that are impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates are described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2024 10-K. Since December 31, 2024, there have been no material changes in the Company’s accounting policies that are impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates.\n2025 Goodwill Impairment Testing\nIn the second quarter of 2025, the Board approved actions to shut down certain upstream manufacturing assets. As a result of the announced actions, the Company identified potential indicators of goodwill impairment and evaluated whether the fair value of any reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. The Company identified one reporting unit for which a quantitative interim goodwill impairment test was required. The results of the quantitative impairment test concluded that no goodwill impairment existed, as the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit. \nIn the third quarter of 2025, as a result of continued macroeconomic challenges, the Company evaluated whether the fair value of any reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. The Company identified one reporting unit for which a quantitative interim goodwill impairment test was required. The results of the quantitative impairment test concluded that no goodwill impairment existed, as the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit.\nThe Company continues to monitor key factors that could impact the fair value of its reporting units, including changes in macroeconomic conditions or industry-specific trends, deterioration in financial performance, increases in market interest rates or adverse changes in regulatory or competitive environments. If these, or other adverse events occur, it may be necessary to perform additional impairment testing, which could result in a future goodwill impairment charge. For additional information, see Notes 5 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n62\nTable of Contents\nAsbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation\nUnion Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past several decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos‑containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide’s premises, and Union Carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. (“Amchem”). In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to Union Carbide’s products.\nThe table below provides information regarding asbestos-related claims pending against Union Carbide and Amchem based on criteria developed by Union Carbide and its external consultants:\nAsbestos-Related Claim Activity\n2025\n2024\nClaims unresolved at Jan 1\n5,813 \n6,367 \nClaims filed\n3,407 \n3,472 \nClaims settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved\n(2,719)\n(4,469)\nClaims unresolved at Sep 30\n6,501 \n5,370 \nClaimants with claims against both Union Carbide and Amchem\n(1,192)\n(963)\nIndividual claimants at Sep 30\n5,309 \n4,407 \nPlaintiffs’ lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants. As a result, the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to Union Carbide, Amchem or any other particular defendant, even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury. For these reasons and based upon Union Carbide’s litigation and settlement experience, Union Carbide does not consider the damages alleged against Union Carbide and Amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos-related liability.\nFor additional information, see Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings; and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2024 10-K."
