We design innovative solutions to treat and keep people out of the hospital, empowering them to live healthier, higher-quality lives. Our digital health technologies and cloud-connected medical devices transform care for people with sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and other chronic diseases. Our comprehensive residential care software platforms support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. By enabling better care, our products improve quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease, and lower costs for consumers and healthcare systems.\nFollowing our formation in 1989, we commercialized a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, which was the first successful non-invasive treatment for OSA. CPAP systems deliver pressurized air, typically through a mask, to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Since the development of CPAP, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of innovative products and solutions for a broad range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, and dental devices. In addition, we are a leading provider of cloud-based health applications, software and devices designed to provide connected care, enabling clinicians to manage more patients efficiently and effectively, as well as enabling and encouraging patients’ long-term adherence to and satisfaction with their therapy. \nWe also provide management software that assists durable or home medical equipment (DME/HME) providers, and other long-term care providers operate more effectively and efficiently across various residential care settings. With a \n-1-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\ncomprehensive set of software and services offerings, our software solutions enable providers to streamline workflow and deliver an improved patient experience across our existing vertical markets including HME and home infusion, facility-based organizations including skilled nursing, senior living, and life plan communities, home health and hospice providers, and to adjacent providers through a growing portfolio of value-added solutions with broad applicability. \nIn May 2025, we acquired VirtuOx, a software-enabled independent diagnostic testing facility, or IDTF, and provider of technology solutions to facilitate in-home and remote testing services for sleep, respiratory, cardiac, and other health conditions across the United States, or U.S. This acquisition strengthens our position in the sleep and breathing health market by expanding our ability to offer end-to-end solutions, including home-based diagnostics and patient monitoring. VirtuOx will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Resmed. The acquisition is not material to our financial results.\nWe employ more than 10,600 people and sell our products in more than 140 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors.\nOur website address is www.resmed.com. We make our periodic reports, together with any amendments, available on our investor relations website (https://investor.resmed.com), free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish the reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site, www.sec.gov, which contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. We also make available on our investor relations website, public financial information for which a report is not required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC. Information contained on our website or in reports, other than those filed with or furnished to the SEC, is not part of or incorporated into this report. \nCorporate History\nOur Australian subsidiary, ResMed Holdings Pty Limited, was originally organized in 1989 by Dr. Peter Farrell to acquire from Baxter Center for Medical Research Pty Limited, or Baxter, the rights to certain technology relating to CPAP treatment as well as Baxter’s existing CPAP device business. Baxter acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 and sold CPAP devices in Australia from 1988 until our acquisition of the business.\nResMed Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in March 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries. In June 1995, we completed an initial public offering of common stock and our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ National Market. In September 1999, we transferred our principal listing to the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, trading under the ticker symbol “RMD”. In November 1999, we established a secondary listing of our common stock via Chess Depositary Instruments, or CDIs, on the Australian Stock Exchange (now known as the Australian Securities Exchange), or ASX, also under the symbol “RMD”. Ten CDIs on the ASX represent one share of our common stock on the NYSE. \nSince formation, we have grown organically through global expansion as well as by acquiring a number of businesses, including distributors, suppliers, developers of medical equipment and related technologies, and software solution providers.\nSegment Information \nWe operate in two segments, which are the Sleep and Breathing Health segment and Residential Care Software segment. See Note 13 – Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting. Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Market\nWe are focused on sleep and related breathing health, both of which we believe are globally underpenetrated, and where we believe our products can improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers, help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and reduce overall healthcare system costs. Additionally, our software solutions are focused on those who provide residential care, which we believe is fragmented and underserved, and where we see significant opportunity to transform and significantly improve residential healthcare through a strategy of enabling better patient care, improving clinical decision support, and driving interoperability across residential care settings.\n-2-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSleep and Breathing Health\nSleep\nSleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states: rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep and non-rapid eye movement, or non-REM, sleep. REM sleep, which is about 20-25% of total sleep experienced by adults, is characterized by a high level of brain activity, bursts of rapid eye movement, increased heart and respiration rates, and paralysis of many muscles. Non-REM sleep is subdivided into three stages that generally parallel sleep depth; stage 1 is the lightest and stage 3 is the deepest.\nThe upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles. Normally, during REM sleep and deeper levels of non-REM sleep, upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows. Individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep, called apneas, and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas. These breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration, causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide, signaling the body to respond. Typically, the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep, causing the throat muscles to contract, opening the airway. After a few gasping breaths, blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself. Sufferers of OSA typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour. While these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep, the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions. OSA has been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.\nA long-term epidemiology study published in 2013 estimated that 26% of adults aged 30-70 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea. Another study published in \nLancet Respiratory Medicine\n in 2019 estimated that mild to severe OSA impacts more than 936 million people worldwide, including 54 million Americans. Of those impacted globally, it was estimated that more than 424 million would have moderate to severe sleep apnea. Despite the high prevalence of OSA, there is a general lack of awareness of OSA among both the medical community and the general public. It is estimated that less than 20% of those with OSA have been diagnosed or treated in the U.S., and 10% or less in other markets. Many healthcare professionals often do not diagnose OSA because they are unaware that such non-specific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, snoring, hypertension, and irritability are characteristic of OSA.\nWhile sleep apnea has been diagnosed in a small portion of a broad cross-section of the population, until recently it has most frequently been diagnosed among middle-aged men with obesity. However, we believe the importance of sleep apnea in women is increasingly being recognized, with nearly 40% of new PAP patients being female. Among all patients, a strong association has been discovered between sleep apnea and a number of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Studies have shown that sleep apnea is present in approximately 83% of patients with drug-resistant hypertension, approximately 77% of patients with obesity, approximately 76% of patients with chronic heart failure, and approximately 72% of patients with type 2 diabetes.\nA study presented at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress in 2021 and later published in CHEST in 2022 found that using PAP therapy as directed can significantly increase sleep apnea patients’ chances of living longer. The study concluded that people with obstructive sleep apnea who started and continued PAP therapy were 39% more likely to survive over a three-year period than OSA patients who did not. Researchers found that the survival rate gap remained significant when accounting for patients’ ages, overall health, other pre-existing conditions, and causes of death.\nSleep-Disordered Breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea.\n Sleep-disordered breathing, or SDB, encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep. Manifestations include OSA, central sleep apnea, or CSA, and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep. Hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity, chronic obstructive lung disease, and neuromuscular disease. OSA is the most common form of SDB.\nSleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by OSA can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, reduced cognitive function, including memory loss and lack of concentration, depression, and irritability. OSA sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas. Several studies demonstrate that the oxygen desaturation, increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by OSA may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina, stroke, and heart attack. Patients with OSA have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem- solving, response speed, and visual motor coordination; studies have linked OSA to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents.\n-3-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGenerally, an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of OSA is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation. The diagnosis of OSA typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home. During overnight testing, respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored, along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Simpler tests, using devices such as our ApneaLink Air, NightOwl, or our automatic PAP devices, monitor airflow during sleep, and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns. These tests allow sleep clinicians to detect sleep disturbances such as apneas, hypopneas, or subconscious awakenings. \nBefore 1981, the primary treatment for OSA was a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient’s windpipe. Alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or UPPP, in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and streamline the shape of the airway or implant a device to add support to the soft palate. UPPP alone has a poor success rate; however, when performed in conjunction with multi-stage upper airway surgical procedures, a greater success rate has been claimed. These combined procedures, performed by highly specialized surgeons, are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods. Consequently, surgical treatments are not considered first-line therapy for OSA. Other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery, mandibular advancement surgery, dental appliances, palatal implants, somnoplasty, nasal devices, and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles. Recently, pharmaceutical therapy treatments have been cleared for the treatment of OSA and others are reportedly under development.\nA variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of OSA. Most are only partially effective. CPAP is a reliable treatment for all severities of OSA and is considered first-line therapy. Use of mandibular advancement devices is increasingly used as a second-line option in patients unable to use CPAP or those with mild OSA. These devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway. CPAP is a non-invasive means of treating OSA. CPAP was first used as a treatment for OSA in 1980 by Dr. Colin Sullivan, the past Chairman of our Medical Advisory Board, and was commercialized for treatment of OSA in the U.S. in the mid-1980s. During CPAP treatment, a patient sleeps with an interface connected to a small portable air device that delivers room air at a positive pressure. The patient breathes in air from the device and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface. Continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed. Interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows. Sometimes, when a patient leaks air through their mouth, a full-face mask may need to be used, rather than a nasal interface.\nCPAP is not a cure and, therefore, must be used nightly as long as treatment is required. Patient compliance has been a major factor in the effectiveness of CPAP treatment. Early generations of CPAP units provided limited patient comfort and convenience. Patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the CPAP device operating at the prescribed pressure. In recent years, we have developed product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance. These include more comfortable patient interface systems; delay timers that gradually increase air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily; bilevel air devices, including our AirCurve 11 Series devices, which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation; heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable; and auto-titration devices that modulate the average pressure delivered during the night. We also offer myAir, a patient engagement application that provides sleep data and a daily score based on a user's previous night’s data to improve compliance. \nBreathing Health\nOur aim is to provide breathing health solutions to patients with COPD and other chronic respiratory diseases, such as overlap syndrome, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or OHS, and neuromuscular disease, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. We aim to improve patient quality of life, slow down disease progression and reduce the costs of patient management.\nOur products cover patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life support. Our devices are predominantly used in the home and, to a lesser extent, in general hospital wards and respiratory wards. We supply CPAP and bilevel device systems, high flow therapy device systems (HFT), non-invasive and invasive ventilators, humidifiers, and accessories, including masks, nasal cannula, headgear, and tubing. We also provide data management systems designed to improve the management of patients by care providers.\n-4-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. \nCOPD encompasses a group of lung diseases defined by persistent airflow limitation, prolongation of exhalation and loss of elasticity in the lungs. It is a progressive and debilitating disease and is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the airways. Symptoms encountered with COPD include shortness of breath as well as chronic cough and increased sputum production. COPD includes diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. A recent study based on recent epidemiology data estimates that there are approximately 480 million people worldwide who suffer from COPD, the world’s third leading cause of death.\nPatients with COPD can have different clinical presentations. Patients with chronic bronchitis present with low level of oxygen (hypoxemia) and elevated levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia), a chronic productive cough, cor pulmonale, and commonly have excess weight. Patients with emphysema have more normal blood gases, are usually thin and hyperinflated and have a decreased diffusion capacity. During sleep, chronic bronchitic patients display more severe hypoxemia. In general, the more hypoxic a COPD patient is during the day the more severe the hypoxemia experienced during sleep. Hypercapnia as a consequence of hypoventilation also occurs in COPD patients and is more pronounced in REM sleep. Some COPD patients may also suffer from comorbid OSA, a condition known as Overlap Syndrome.\nHome non-invasive ventilation has the potential to reduce healthcare costs associated with the management of patients with severe COPD by significantly increasing the time between hospital readmissions. Early research also suggests that home HFT may help improve clinical outcomes in hypoxemic COPD patients that frequently have exacerbations.\nOverlap Syndrome. \nIn patients with COPD-OSA Overlap Syndrome, CPAP has been shown to provide benefits in relation to reducing mortality, decreasing hospitalizations and improving lung function and gas exchange. Non-invasive ventilation, or NIV, has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD through its ability to improve respiratory acidosis and decrease dyspnea and work of breathing. It may also increase survival rates and reduce length of hospital stays, as well as reducing complicating factors such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. In patients with stable COPD, the advantages of home NIV are less clear, but clinical studies have shown improvements in dyspnea scores and health-related quality-of-life measures and reductions in hospital readmissions and intensive care stays.\nObesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. \nOHS is characterized by the combination of obesity, chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia and hypoxia and sleep apnea after the exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation. An estimated 90% of patients with OHS also have OSA. In patients with OHS, positive airway therapy, with either CPAP or NIV, has been shown to effectively treat upper airway obstruction and reverse daytime respiratory failure as well as reduce the work of breathing and improve respiratory drive. \nNeuromuscular Disease. \nNeuromuscular disease is a broad term that encompasses many diseases that either directly (via intrinsic muscle pathology) or indirectly (via nerve pathology) impair the functioning of muscles. Symptoms of neuromuscular disease and respiratory failure include increasing generalized weakness and fatigue, dysphagia, dyspnoea on exertion and at rest, sleepiness, morning headache, difficulties with concentration, and mood changes. Most neuromuscular diseases are characterized by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation, being wheelchair-bound, swallowing difficulties, respiratory muscle weakness, and, eventually, death from respiratory failure. Neuromuscular disorders can progress rapidly or slowly. Rapidly progressive conditions, such as ALS and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in teenagers, are characterized by muscle impairment which worsens over months and can result in death within a few years. Variable or slowly progressive conditions, such as myotonic muscular dystrophy, are characterized by muscle impairment that worsens over years and may mildly reduce life expectancy. \nNIV treatment to patients with neuromuscular disease may lead to improvements in respiratory failure symptoms and daytime arterial blood gases. In ALS patients, NIV treatment has been associated with an improvement in quality of life measures, sleep-related symptoms and survival. Studies have demonstrated that patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may improve in quality of life measures and may increase chance of survival with NIV treatment.\nResidential Care Software\nOur Residential Care Software business provides cloud-based solutions to healthcare providers operating in the residential care market, including HME and home infusion providers, home health and hospice providers, skilled nursing facilities, private duty nursing organizations, senior living facilities, and life plan communities. These providers face increasing operational and compliance complexities due to factors such as evolving reimbursement frameworks, workforce constraints, and demographic shifts. Our Residential Care Software offerings are designed to support customers in addressing these challenges by helping providers perform analytics, manage documentation and implement new \n-5-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nreimbursement requirements as well as more effectively transfer data as patients move between different care settings. Our \nResidential Care Software\n platforms include capabilities for billing and business management, electronic medical records, revenue cycle management, operational analytics, patient engagement, and workforce management. \nBusiness Strategy\nWe envision a world where every person can achieve their full potential through better sleep and breathing, with care delivered in their own home. We believe the sleep and breathing treatments will continue to grow due to a number of factors, including increasing awareness of OSA, CSA and COPD; improved understanding of the role of sleep apnea treatment in the management of adjacent pathologies; improved understanding of the role of bilevel therapy and non-invasive ventilation in the management of COPD; and an increase in the use of digital and product technology to improve patient outcomes and create efficiencies for customers and providers. Our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of sleep and breathing health markets, as well as growth in residential care settings, consists of the following key elements: \n•\nGrow and Differentiate Our Core Sleep Apnea Portfolio.\n We are the leader in developing smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected products. We aim to continue differentiating our products by integrating artificial‑intelligence and machine‑learning, or AI and ML, algorithms to further enhance therapy performance and user experience. Sleep is becoming a more important aspect of our customers' lives, and we intend to drive higher rates of screening, diagnosis, and therapy adoption through simpler care pathways. In April 2025, we made our home sleep apnea test, NightOwl, available across the U.S., providing a simplified, accurate, and efficient way to diagnose OSA from the comfort of an individual’s home. In May 2025, we acquired VirtuOx, an IDTF, to expand our ability to partner with healthcare providers to help streamline the diagnostic process, while expanding collaboration with home medical equipment providers to efficiently support patients to start treatment.\n•\nAccelerate Market Growth through Awareness.\n We continue to expand our existing educational activities to increase awareness of sleep apnea, COPD, and other clinical conditions that can be treated with our industry-leading solutions. These activities target both the population predisposed to sleep apnea and medical specialists, such as pulmonologists, sleep medicine specialists, primary care physicians, cardiologists, neurologists, and other medical subspecialists who treat these conditions and their associated comorbidities. We target special interest groups, including the National Stroke Association, the American Heart Association, COPD Foundation, and the National Sleep Foundation, to further increase awareness of the relationship between OSA, COPD, neuromuscular disease, and comorbidities such as cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. The programs also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety, especially in the transport industry. We have helped establish a center for clinical care and medical research at the University of California, San Diego, in the fields of sleep apnea and COPD. We have also established a chair for the study of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School. \n•\nCapitalize on Broader Sleep and Breathing Health Adjacencies.\n Our evolution is designed to capitalize on key macro trends, including the enhanced spotlight on sleep apnea due to pharmaceuticals and consumer technology. Through our brand leadership and expertise, we are positioned to serve large, unmet needs in insomnia, COPD and other respiratory and related conditions. Research supported by Resmed has demonstrated that the addition of non-invasive ventilation to patients with severe COPD who are receiving oxygen therapy provides meaningful clinical benefits to the patient and the broader healthcare system. We are committed to ongoing innovation of our breathing health products, providing advanced and expanded integrations of our therapy-based software solutions, including AirView, enabling clinicians to remotely monitor patients on some ventilation devices and bilevel devices. Additionally, studies have established a clinical association between OSA and both stroke and chronic heart failure and have recognized sleep apnea as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure. Research also indicates that sleep apnea is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. We maintain close working relationships with prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology.\n•\nI\nnvest in an Integrated, Intelligent Digital‑Health Ecosystem Delivered at Home.\n Digital enablement is central to our strategy. Our secure cloud-based digital health applications, along with our devices, are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers, allowing fewer professionals to manage more patients and empowering patients to track their own health outcomes. We can \n-6-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nleverage our installed base of more than 30 million patients using cloud‑connected devices on AirView and over 10 million patients registered to our myAir platform to enable personalized, efficient and data‑driven care. Our own efforts to drive increased therapy adoption, as well as increased adoption through use of wearables with sleep monitoring functionality, will allow us to further build upon our data advantage. \n•\nAlign Solutions to Enable Smarter, Connected Care.\n Our leading Residential Care Software solutions are a key enabler of our Sleep and Breathing Health business, driving revenue synergies, contributing to demand generation and providing cohesion and interoperability for our AI-driven digital platform. We are connecting capabilities across the platforms in these residential care settings to help our customers be more efficient, better serve people, keep them out of hospital, and provide care in lower-cost, higher-quality care settings. Today, our Residential Care Software solutions support residential care providers serving more than 160 million individual patient accounts.\nProducts\nOur portfolio of products includes devices, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, and cloud-based software and informatics solutions. For purposes of the following discussion, we generally refer to our air flow generators and ventilators collectively as devices.\nDevices\nWe produce cloud-connected CPAP, automatic positive airway pressure, or APAP, bilevel, adaptive servo-ventilation, or ASV, and HFT devices that deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface, either a mask or cannula. Our APAP, devices, known as AutoSet, are based on a patented technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis, treatment and management of OSA in some countries. During fiscal year 2017, we launched AirMini, a small portable CPAP combining the same proven therapy modes used in our APAP devices with waterless humidification enabling portable convenience. During fiscal year 2021, we launched our new platform of connected CPAP and APAP devices, AirSense 11, which introduced new features such as a touch screen, algorithms for patients new to therapy, and digital enhancements, such as over-the-air update capabilities. Devices in total accounted for approximately 52%, 52%, and 54% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\n-7-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs. Sleep apnea is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue and irritability. Studies have established a clinical association between untreated sleep apnea and systemic hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, and mortality. \nAcross the sleep and breathing health platforms, we support clinical trials in many countries including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Argentina, Chile, China, Republic of Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology. We also continue to support some of the largest sleep apnea studies in history by performing advanced statistical analyses on millions of real-world, de-identified, clinical data points collected through our cloud-connected devices and patient engagement tools. These studies provide clinical insights around patient management, device settings, and predictors of patient adherence that inform our product development efforts. Some of the more recent real-world studies point to a link between PAP adherence and reduced mortality among patients with OSA.\nWe consult with physicians at major medical centers throughout the world to identify clinical and technological trends in the treatment of sleep apnea, COPD, and the other conditions associated with these diseases. New product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff, direct sales force, and clinicians.\nSales and Marketing \nWe currently market our products in more than 140 countries through a network of distributors and direct sales staff. We attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each major geography, often based on regional awareness of sleep apnea as a health problem, physician referral patterns, consumer preferences, and local reimbursement policies. See Note 13 – Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information about our geographic areas.\nUnited States, Canada, and Latin America. \nOur products are typically purchased by a HME provider who then sells the products to the patient. The decision to purchase our products, as opposed to those of our competitors, is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations: prescribing practitioners; HME providers; insurers (both private and public); and patients. In the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives, program development specialists and regional sales directors. Our field sales organization markets and sells products to HME provider branch locations throughout the U.S., Canada, and Latin America. \nWe also directly educate physicians and sleep clinics about our products. Patients who are diagnosed with OSA or another respiratory condition and prescribed our products are typically referred by the diagnosing physician or sleep clinic to a HME provider to fill the prescription. The HME provider, in consultation with the referring practitioner, will assist the patient in selecting the equipment, fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the device pressure to the prescribed level. \nOur Residential Care Software solutions are sold to providers of healthcare in various residential care settings. We market and sell our Brightree business management software and service solutions to providers in the U.S. Our primary markets are HME, pharmacy, home infusion, orthotics and prosthetics. Our sales activities for Brightree products are conducted through an employee sales organization made up of strategic account managers, sales engineers and sales directors. We develop, market, and sell our MatrixCare care management and related ancillary solutions to providers in the U.S. and our primary customers are senior living; skilled nursing; life plan communities; home health, home care, and hospice agencies as well as related accountable care organizations. Our MatrixCare management solutions are primarily sold through direct sales and ancillary solutions are sold both through direct sales and channel sellers.\nCombined Europe, Asia, and other markets.\n We market our products in most major countries in combined Europe, Asia and other geographies. We have wholly owned subsidiaries in Australia, Austria, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. We use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors to sell our products in combined Europe, Asia, and other regions. We select independent distributors in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to treatment of sleep apnea with our therapy. In countries where we sell our products directly, a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales. In many countries, we sell our products to HME providers or hospitals who then sell the products to the patients. In Germany, Australia, New \n-10-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nZealand, and South Korea, we also operate home healthcare businesses, providing products and services directly to patients through a vertically integrated network. \nWe only sell our Residential Care Software products in the U.S. and Germany. \nManufacturing \nWe operate a globally distributed manufacturing network designed to optimize quality, control costs, reduce time to market for new product introduction, and generate supply chain resilience. Our manufacturing operations consist of specialist component production as well as technical assembly and comprehensive testing and quality control of our devices, masks, and accessories. Of the numerous raw materials, parts and components purchased for our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products, many are available from multiple vendors. We also purchase uniquely configured components from various suppliers, including some who are single-source suppliers for us. Any reduction or halt in supply from one of these suppliers could limit our ability to manufacture our products or devices until a replacement supplier is found and qualified. We generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received. We strive for continuous improvement in manufacturing processes to deliver year-on-year improvement in quality, availability and value. Each manufacturing site and team are responsible for the quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures, including customer feedback. \nResmed's supply chain may be impacted by periodic transport disruptions and supply constraints on certain raw materials and electronic components, including semiconductor chips and magnets. Such disruptions or constraints impact our ability to manufacture products in quantities and in the time necessary to satisfy global customer demand, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nFurther, we source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries. Changes to trade policy, including tariff measures introduced in February 2025, may drive new inflation risks in our supply chain for these components and materials. On April 5, 2025, U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a Notice of Implementation confirming that current tariff relief for products like ours continues. The current impact of global tariffs is dynamic, however. If reciprocal tariffs go into widespread effect, they could have a material impact on our business and financial statements through interruption of supply chains, increases in our costs as our suppliers deal with an uncertain global trade environment or an increase or disruption of global shipping. \nOur quality management system is based upon the requirements of ISO 13485, Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, Quality System Regulation, or QSR, being replaced by the new FDA Quality Management System Regulation, or QMSR, effective February 2, 2026, European Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell. Our main manufacturing sites are certified to ISO 13485 and are audited at regular intervals by a Notified Body. Additionally, our Sydney, Tuas, San Diego, Atlanta, and Moreno Valley sites are certified under the Medical Device Single Audit Program or MDSAP, an audit of medical device manufacturers’ quality management system to satisfy multiple regulatory requirements. MDSAP audits are conducted by a MDSAP recognized auditing organization and can fulfill the needs of multiple regulatory jurisdictions (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, and the U.S.). Our Sydney and Singapore manufacturing operations operate an Environmental Management System (EMS) certified to ISO 14001:2015. We are progressively extending the EMS across our manufacturing network.\nOur main manufacturing facilities for Resmed-branded products are located in Tuas, Singapore; Sydney, Australia; Chatsworth, California; Calabasas, California; Johor Bahru, Malaysia; and Atlanta, Georgia. The principal factory for our Curative-branded products is in Suzhou, China. Our Narval-branded products are manufactured in Lyon, France. Refer to Item 2 for additional details on these properties. We will continue to expand and balance volume across our network to meet scale, cost, resilience, and environmental performance objectives, and to meet the needs of customers and patients.\nThird-Party Coverage and Reimbursement\nThe cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs. In Germany and Korea, we receive payments directly from these payors. While we do not generally receive direct payments for our products from payors in other countries, our success largely depends on the ability of patients to obtain coverage and our customers to obtain adequate reimbursement from those payors. \n-11-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn the U.S., our products are purchased primarily by HME providers, health systems, or sleep clinics, who invoice third-party payors directly for reimbursement. Domestic third-party payors include government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid and commercial health insurance plans. These payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that specific defined coverage criteria are not met or that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods, or is experimental, or not deemed reasonable and necessary. Additionally, our recent acquisition of VirtuOx will now require us to bill both commercial and governmental payors in the U.S. for diagnostic testing and interpretation services. As an IDTF, VirtuOx is subject to various enrollment, coverage and billing requirements by Medicare, state Medicaid Programs, other governmental payors, and commercial health insurance plans. Payors may deny coverage and reimbursement for VirtuOx’s services if they determine that specific defined coverage criteria are not met or that the services are not medically necessary. VirtuOx experiences frequent government payor audits and while we believe that our billing is appropriate, such audits incur business expenses and decisions may not always be favorable.\nThe long-term trend towards cost-containment, through managed healthcare, or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare, could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products and services. In some countries, such as France, Germany, and Japan, government reimbursement is currently available for the purchase or rental of our products, subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In Australia, China, and some other countries, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat OSA. \nHealthcare reform in the U.S. continues to bring significant changes to the third-party payor landscape. The DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program was mandated by Congress through the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). In 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, implemented the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) competitive bidding program, which included durable medical equipment purchasers of our CPAP and respiratory assist devices (or bilevel devices), and related supplies and accessories. Under the program, DMEPOS suppliers compete to become Medicare contract suppliers by submitting bids to furnish certain items in competitive bidding areas (CBAs). The lower payment amounts resulting from the competition may replace the Medicare fee schedule amounts for the bid items in these areas. CMS is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years and to roll out the competitive bidding process nationally or adjust prices in non-competitive bidding areas to match competitive bidding prices. The implementation of the competitive bidding program has resulted in reduced Medicare payment for CPAP and respiratory assist devices, and related supplies and accessories in both competitive bidding areas and non-competitive bidding areas.\nThe last round of competitive bid contracts lapsed, effective January 1, 2019. CMS then removed 13 product categories, including CPAP and respiratory assist devices (or bilevel devices), from the Round 2021 Competitive Bidding Program competition. As a result, these products are currently subject to a temporary gap period during which any Medicare-enrolled DMEPOS suppliers may furnish DMEPOS items and services to patients. Payment for Medicare-enrolled DMEPOS suppliers in former CBAs is based on 100% of the single payment amount, for the CBA increased by the projected percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) from January 2023 to January 2024. The temporary gap period for all DMEPOS CBPs has recently ended with the announcement of new regulations reinstating competitive bidding in the U.S. As a consequence, we expect that CMS will initiate the next round of the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program after the agency completes the formal public notice and comment rulemaking process. \nFor items furnished in non-CBAs, fees are based on fully-adjusted rates per the applicable methodology under Code of Federal Regulations Title 42 414.210 (g).\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, resulted in reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 but were subject to a temporary suspension. The Protecting Medicare and American Farmers From Sequester Cuts Act was signed into law December 10, 2021. The law extended the 2% Medicare sequester moratorium through March 31, 2022, adjusted the sequester to 1% between April 1, 2022, and June 30, 2022, and reinstated the full 2% sequestration cut which began on July 1, 2022 and continues until further notice. The payment reduction applicable to healthcare providers applies to the approved Medicare payment amount, after the deductible and coinsurance are applied. The reduction in payment does not affect the 20% coinsurance owed by the patient. The sequestration order covers all payments for services with dates of service on or after July 1, 2022. On March 9, 2024, President Biden signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, \n-12-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nwhich included a 2.93% update to the CY 2024 Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) Conversion Factor (CF) for dates of service March 9 through December 31, 2024. This replaced the 1.25% update provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. On November 1, 2024, CMS issued a rule finalizing changes for Medicare payments under the PFS and other Medicare Part B policies, effective on or after January 1, 2025. Under this final rule, the average payment rates under the PFS would be reduced by 2.93% in CY 2025, removing the temporary increase in payment for CY 2024. This amounts to an estimated CY 2025 PFS conversion factor of $32.35, a decrease of $0.94 from the CY 2024 conversion factor of $33.29, resulting in lower Medicare payments to Part B suppliers. As discussed immediately below, however, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a 1-year, 2.5% increase to the PFS for 2026, which temporarily addresses the 2025 payment cuts.\nMost recently, on July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the Bill), which among other things, cuts federal Medicaid funding by $930 billion over ten years but provides reimbursement rate increases for providers. Notably, however, the Bill is projected to increase the federal deficit, which may lead to mandatory Medicare cuts and reduction in payments to providers in the future. The Bill also makes changes to the ACA that could reduce enrollment, including shortening enrollment periods and eliminating automatic re-enrollment. \nAdditionally, in 2022, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, proposed an adjustment through regulation to amend the previously adopted schedule of VA ratings for sleep apnea. Specifically, the proposed rule would remove in its entirety the current 30% disability rating for veterans exhibiting excessive daytime sleepiness and instead replacing it with a 10% disability rating for veterans with a sleep apnea diagnosis with incomplete relief (as determined by a sleep study) with treatment including a CPAP machine, and further, remove the automatic 50% disability rating for veterans with a documented need for a CPAP machine (50% disability would instead require that the veteran have a sleep apnea diagnosis with ineffective treatment, as determined by a sleep study, or who is unable to use treatment due to comorbid conditions, without end-organ damage). The VA has not yet changed its ratings criteria but it could happen in calendar year 2025. If the changes are implemented, veterans who were rated for sleep apnea before the change in criteria will be grandfathered and retain their rating. However, all veterans filing new claims on and after the change in ratings criteria would be evaluated under the new criteria. The VA has not yet adopted these changes to the disability ratings system for sleep apnea but should this proposal, or another similar proposal to limit disability ratings be adopted, fewer veterans may pursue treatment of sleep apnea using CPAP or more veterans would claim ineffective treatment with CPAP to obtain a higher rating. The legislative landscape is complex and changes with the influence of one party or the other. The Trump Administration has issued many executive orders and new policy initiatives in 2025, including those impacting the healthcare and life sciences industry. We expect that new legislation, agency rules, and policy changes, including potential changes to the ACA, Medicaid funding, and other healthcare reform measures including flow down impacts from the Bill, may be adopted in the future and may result in additional reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for our products and services. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may have a material adverse impact on our revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations.\nService and Warranty \nWe generally offer either one-year or two-year limited warranties on our devices. In some regions and for certain customers we also offer extended warranties on our devices for one to three years in addition to our limited warranty. Warranties on mask systems are typically 90 days. Our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement. We receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons. We believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices. We record reserves for warranties and returns based on historical data. \nCompetition\nGlobal competition for sales of our products and services is intense. We believe that the principal competitive factors are product features, value-added solutions, quality, reliability and price. Customer support, reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors. We compete in various geographies, each with different competitors, and some of our competitors are affiliates of our customers, which may make it difficult to compete with them. \n-13-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur primary Sleep and Breathing Health competitors include Philips BV; Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited; DeVilbiss Healthcare; Apex Medical Corporation; BMC Medical Co. Ltd.; React Health Corporation; Jiangsu Yuyue Medical Equipment & Supply Co., Ltd, and Lowenstein Medical SE & Co. KG plus regional and new-entrant manufacturers. \nOur products compete with surgical procedures, nerve stimulation devices, and dental appliances designed to treat OSA and other sleep apnea-related respiratory conditions. The adoption of new pharmaceuticals to treat obesity, a typical comorbidity of OSA, could impact our ongoing or future sales. For example, injectable glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, weight loss drugs may lower the occurrence of obesity, eventually reducing the severity of OSA, if significant weight loss is maintained. Injectable weight loss drugs have been approved for treatment of OSA in patients with obesity and moderate to severe OSA and are being marketed by physicians and to consumers. Oral versions of these drugs are reportedly under development and may be approved for the treatment of OSA. The development of new or innovative drugs, procedures, devices, or alternative therapies by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive, which would harm our revenues and financial condition.\nFor our Residential Care Software business, competition is also intense, rapidly evolving, and subject to changing technology, low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many of our customers use systems developed in-house to run their businesses. The development of new or innovative software solutions by others could result in our solutions becoming obsolete or noncompetitive, which would harm our revenues and financial condition.\nAny product developed by us will have to compete for market acceptance and sales. An important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products and solutions. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products and solutions, complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes, and provide commercial supply of products and solutions to the market are important competitive factors. In addition, our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our products with patents and other intellectual property. \nPatents and Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation \nWe rely on a combination of patents, designs, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights. Some of these patents, patent applications, and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products. We believe the combination of these rights, in aggregate, are of material importance to each of our businesses. Through our various subsidiaries, as of the date of this report, we own or have licensed rights to approximately 10,000 pending, allowed or granted patents and designs globally. Patents and designs have various statutory terms based on the legislation in individual jurisdictions which may be subject to change. Of our patents and designs, approximately 640 U.S. patents and designs and approximately 1,450 foreign patents and designs are due to expire in the next five years. We believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position.\nLitigation has been necessary in the past and may be necessary in the future to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our rights, or to defend third-party claims of infringement asserted against us by others. The defense and prosecution of patent claims, including pending claims, as well as participation in other inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and time-consuming, even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us. Patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country. We have in the past, and may in the future, be required or choose to license patents and other intellectual property rights owned by other parties. Therefore, there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits.\nGovernment Regulations \nFDA\nOur products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to FDA QSR, and related manufacturing standards. Medical device products are subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the U.S. and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad. The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, marking, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping for our products, in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the U.S. are safe and effective for their intended use. In addition, the FDA is authorized to establish special controls to \n-14-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nprovide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution. \nUnless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device, certain modifications thereof, or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance, a premarket approval, or PMA, or a de novo approval, and pay a user fee, before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device, as well as whether or not a similar or “predicate” device exists to support a 510(k) application. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Certain software products may also be classified as a medical device.\nOur devices currently marketed in the U.S. are marketed pursuant to 510(k) pre-marketing clearances and are either Class I or Class II devices. Certain of our software products may be classified as medical devices requiring a pre-marketing clearance or approval while others may not be medical devices, are medical devices that are exempt from the 510(k) process, or will be commercialized under FDA’s current policy of enforcement discretion. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and may require clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a predecessor device that was (a) legally marketed in the U.S. before the 1976 Medical Device Amendments that established the 510(k) pathway or (b) brought to market after 1976 pursuant to the 510(k) pathway. Such a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device.” Devices that do not have such a predicate are typically classified as Class III by default and are required to undergo the stringent PMA pathway that includes provision of clinical evidence and trials. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and require the submission of extensive performance and clinical information. However, a sponsor may apply to the FDA to reclassify devices that do not have predicates to Class I or II if the device is of low to moderate risk. If the FDA grants the application, such a device is termed a “de novo” device and is evaluated through the somewhat more flexible de novo approval pathway. As a result, FDA clearance and approval requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. Finally, there may be instances where the products we sell as a result of an acquisition are subject to further FDA review and clearance.\nMedical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new clearance or approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until clearance or approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nAny devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to exemption, clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies in the U.S. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. As a medical device manufacturer, all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. Noncompliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant clearance or approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions. We believe that our design, manufacturing and quality control procedures comply with the FDA’s regulatory requirements. \nWe must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting or MDR requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to \n-15-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\na death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.\nLabeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.\nSales of medical devices and software outside the U.S. are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. \nEEA\nIn the European Economic Area, (which is comprised of the 27 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), or EEA, medical devices need to comply with specific requirements. These requirements were previously known as “Essential Requirements” under the former EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC, or MDD) and are now defined “General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR)” under the new EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745, or MDR). While the requirements set forth in the MDR are generally consistent with those laid out in the MDD (with a few exceptions), the GSPR are described more in detail compared to the Essential Requirements. Compliance with the Essential Requirements (under the MDD) or the GSPR (under the MDR) is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE marking to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements/GSPR and affix the CE marking, manufacturers of medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements/GSPR, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is a third-party organization designated by a competent authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would audit and examine the Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements/GSPR. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE marking to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.\nAs a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the Essential Requirements/GSPR must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. \nAll manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EEA must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under the MDR, incidents must be reported centrally in the European EUDAMED database (although transitional provisions are in place until EUDAMED is fully functional), and manufacturers are required to take Field Safety Corrective Actions, or FSCAs, to prevent or reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use. The MDR considers “serious incidents” those incidents which, directly or indirectly, led, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons, a serious deterioration in their state of health, or a serious public health threat. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. Where appropriate, our products commercialized in Europe are CE marked and classified as either Class I or Class II. \n-16-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOn April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the MDR, which repeals and replaces the MDD. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member states, the regulations would be directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them) in all EEA member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (IVDR), applicable as of May 26, 2022, provides for the regulatory framework applicable to in vitro diagnostic medical devices.\nThe MDR was meant to become applicable three years after publication (in May 2020). However, on April 23, 2020, to allow EEA national authorities, notified bodies, manufacturers and other actors to focus fully on urgent priorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Council and Parliament adopted Regulation 2020/561, postponing the date of application of the MDR by one year. The MDR thus became applicable on May 26, 2021. The MDR transitional provisions allow the placing on the market of devices with a CE Certificate issued in accordance with the MDD until May 26, 2024, under certain conditions. Moreover, the MDR provides that the following medical devices with a CE Certificate issued in accordance with the MDD may continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025. \n•\nDevices placed on the market in compliance with the MDD prior to May 26, 2021; and\n•\nDevices placed on the market after May 26, 2021, benefiting from the described MDR transitional provisions. \nThe European Commission further extended provision of the MDR and IVDR through Regulation (EU) 2023/607, whereby manufacturers and notified bodies are given sufficiently more time to carry out, in accordance with the MDR, the conformity assessment of devices covered by a certificate or a declaration of conformity issued in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC. Moreover, the deletion of the ‘sell off’ date in the MDR and the IVDR aims to prevent unnecessary disposal of safe devices. These provisions extend the transition period of devices through to December 31, 2027 or December 31, 2028 depending on device risk classification.\nThe MDR, among other things:\n•\nstrengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance once they are available;\n•\nestablishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n•\nimproves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;\n•\nsets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and\n•\nstrengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.\nWe have received certification at several locations, including Sydney, Australia; San Diego, California; and Lyon, France. We continue to transition our certification profile to meet the new MDR requirements.\nOther Regulatory Bodies\nOur devices are sold in multiple countries and often need to be registered with local regulatory bodies such as the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, Health Canada in Canada and CFDA in China. \nOther Healthcare Laws\nWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims and transparency laws with respect to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us.\n-17-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal statute that prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Due to the breadth of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Congress set forth certain exceptions and authorized the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to issue regulations that set forth certain safe harbors to protect arrangements that while implicating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, would generally not cause harm to federal healthcare programs or patients. Satisfaction of all elements of a particular Anti-Kickback Statute statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor will provide immunity from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute to the parties to such remunerative arrangement. Failure to satisfy all elements of an exception or safe harbor, however, does not necessarily lead to a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Because the Anti-Kickback Statute is an intent-based statute, each arrangement is subject to a facts and circumstances analysis to determine whether the requisite intent under the statute is present.\nThe federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Private suits filed under the civil False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government. These individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines, judgement, or settlement.\nThe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of items or services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies. As a medical device manufacturer, the beneficiary inducement prohibition under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law did not directly apply to us (unless we engaged in activities that influenced a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to select a particular provider, practitioner or supplier); however, following our acquisition of VirtuOx, a Medicare supplier, we will be directly subject to the beneficiary inducement prohibition if we provide any remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that is intended to or that we should know would be likely to influence that beneficiary to select VirtuOx as their supplier.\nThe Federal Physician Self-Referral Law, or the Stark Law, 42 U.S.C. 1395n, is a strict liability statute that prohibits a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) who has a financial relationship with an entity from referring patients to that entity for certain designated health services, or DHS, payable by Medicare (and in some cases, Medicaid), unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits such an entity from presenting or causing to be presented a claim to Medicare for DHS provided pursuant to a prohibited referral, and requires the timely refund of collections related to any such prohibited claims. While VirtuOx is a Medicare-enrolled supplier, it currently bills only for the following CPT Codes: 94762, 95819, 95800, G0399, 93229, 93228, 93268, 93271, 93286, 93224, 93243, 93241, 93247, and 93245. None of these codes appear on the CMS DHS Code List, and therefore, we are not currently subject to the Stark Law by virtue of our acquisition of VirtuOx. However, we will need to monitor our VirtuOx offerings in the future and if we choose to offer any DHS, we will be subject to the Stark Law. \nAdditionally, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. \nThe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, biologicals, and medical devices or supplies that require premarket approval by or notification to the FDA, and for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, to report annually to CMS information related to (i) payments and other transfers of value to teaching hospitals, physicians (as defined by statute) and, as of 2022, physician \n-18-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nassistants, nurse practitioners and other practitioners, and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by such providers and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS. \nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation.\nAlso, many U.S. states and countries outside the U.S. have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under government programs. In addition, in the U.S., certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.\nFCPA and Other Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws \nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries, either directly or through our contracted distributors. On February 10, 2025, the Trump Administration issued Executive Order “Pausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement to Further American Economic and National Security”, which paused federal investigations and enforcement actions brought under the FCPA for a period of 180 days. Subsequently, the Department of Justice issued new FCPA enforcement guidelines ending the temporary pause, emphasizing that enforcement will align with U.S. economic interests and national security. Most of the conduct chargeable under the FCPA will also constitute crimes under other laws, such as the U.S. wire fraud statute and the SEC’s civil enforcement authority. Foreign laws prohibiting bribery of a government official will also continue to apply.\nOur present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nData Privacy and Security Laws\nUnder HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations, including the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules, to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities and their business associates, as well as covered subcontractors. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties for each violation. \nIn some of our operations, such as those involving our cloud-based software digital health applications, we are a business associate under HIPAA, requiring us to comply with the terms of the business associate agreements we have with our covered entity customers. Additionally, by virtue of our acquisition of VirtuOx, and expanded efforts to reach patients seeking treatment, we are also subject to the rules applicable to a covered entity. Therefore, we are required to comply with \n-19-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nthe HIPAA Security Rule, Breach Notification Rule and certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. We are limited by HIPAA with respect to our use and disclosure of protected health information created or received and could potentially face significant civil and criminal penalties if the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR), or any state Attorney General, were to determine that we failed to comply with the applicable HIPAA standards.\nIn addition to federal privacy and security regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of personal information that are applicable to our business. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, effective on January 1, 2020, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, or collectively, the CCPA, was the first of a series of state privacy laws designed to provide California residents expanded rights with regard to their personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. CCPA’s implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Further, since 2020, more than one-third of U.S. states have adopted—and other states are proposing to adopt— their own comprehensive data protection laws, with varying implementation dates. The application of the laws and the requirements contained therein is not uniform. Although the majority of these omnibus state laws exclude business data, we may be required to undertake additional compliance investment to evaluate the application of these laws to our business and to implement compliance measures and potentially change our business processes. If we are subject to or affected by HIPAA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition. \nIn addition to these comprehensive data protection laws, to date, several states have adopted laws specifically regulating the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of biometrics, and additional states are seeking to regulate—and/or restrict the use of—biometrics in the future. Certain of our products use, or permit the use of, information that could be classified as a biometric under these or other laws. If we are subject to or affected by these or other laws, we may be required to modify the way in which we make available our product or certain features of our products. We also may be required to implement additional practices or processes or otherwise invest our resources to comply with these and other regulations. \nIn addition, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect in May 2018. The United Kingdom, or the UK, has adopted the UK General Data Protection Regulation, or UK GDPR; the EU GDPR and UK GDPR are herein collectively referred to as GDPR. The GDPR imposes stringent data protection requirements for the processing of personal data, whenever GDPR applies to such processing, such as certain processing in the EEA, or in the UK. The GDPR increases our obligations, for example, by requiring more robust disclosures to individuals, strengthening individual data rights, instituting procedures for mandatory data breach notifications to regulators within a short timeframe, limiting retention periods and secondary use of information (including for research purposes), increasing requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data and imposing additional obligations when we contract with third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or UK, including to the U.S.; legal developments continue to create complexity regarding such transfers of personal data from the EEA or UK to the U.S. For example, the European Commission and UK standard contractual clauses under which entities may transfer personal data from the European Union and the UK require us to evaluate such data transfers on a case-by-case basis to ensure continued permissibility under current law and consistent with the standard contractual clauses. GDPR provides that EEA member states and the UK may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection and marketing laws of the EEA member states may result in fines of up to €20.0 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties as well as individual claims for compensation. \nFurther, the UK GDPR also provides for significant data protection fines up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover.\nIn addition, EEA member states and the UK may modify or impose additional conditions to be able to transmit electronic marketing communications.\n-20-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNumerous other state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health information and other personal information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and states’ Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. These laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies. Both the FTC and the OCR have focused on the use of online tracking technologies that collect personal information and protected health information as an enforced priority. We intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information, including with respect to online tracking.\nCompliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to implement additional mechanisms to comply with the new data protection rules. With respect to VirtuOx, for instance, we will need to meet HIPAA's requirements for covered entities and support this additional privacy function. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, damage our reputation and customers’ trust.\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, Laws\nOur services and products may use AI now or in the future. The regulatory landscape for AI is changing rapidly, with both domestic and international activity.\nThere is currently no comprehensive federal legislation in the U.S. concerning the use, development, or deployment of AI. Despite the lack of comprehensive legislation, federal regulators are continuing to pursue AI-related enforcement actions under existing federal laws. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission has pursued several enforcement actions against companies that are alleged to have made false or misleading statements about their AI capabilities, referred to as AI washing, in violation of the Securities Exchange Act. In addition to existing federal laws, federal regulators have also issued guidance concerning the use, development, or deployment of AI. For example, the FDA has issued a variety of guidance on the regulation of AI tools, including guidance on Software as a Medical Device, or SaMD, and clinical decision support, or CDS, software.\nThere are also a number of state laws governing the use, development, or deployment of AI that may be applicable to our business. For example, the Colorado AI Act, or the Act, with compliance obligations taking effect on February 1, 2026, regulates the development, substantial modification, or deployment of AI in Colorado. The Act regulates the use of high-risk AI systems, defined as systems that make or are a substantial factor in making a decision that has a material legal or similarly significant effect on the provision or denial to any consumer of, or the cost or terms of: education enrollment or opportunity, employment or an employment opportunity, a financial or lending service, an essential government service, healthcare services, housing, insurance, or legal services. The Act requires periodic impact assessments for high-risk AI systems and mandates the disclosure of algorithmic discrimination events to the State Attorney General. A number of other states have enacted laws that are more limited in scope and may impose certain transparency or disclosure obligations.\nIn addition, Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 on harmonized rules on artificial intelligence, or the EU AI Act, went into effect in August 2024. The EU AI Act aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for AI. The EU AI Act prohibits the use of AI systems that present unacceptable risk to fundamental rights or public safety. Non-prohibited AI systems may be subject to stringent requirements depending on the level of risk presented, including mandatory risk assessments, transparency obligations, and human oversight. Failure to comply with the requirements of the EU AI Act and the applicable national laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €35.0 million or up to 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. Numerous other countries have adopted or are considering similar frameworks to regulate the use, development, or deployment of AI.\n-21-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe intend to continue to monitor developments regarding the use of AI that could be relevant to our products and services, and comply with all applicable laws regarding the use, development, or deployment of AI. Compliance with these and any other applicable AI laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with new AI laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, damage our reputation and customers’ trust.\nHuman Capital \nAt Resmed, our mission of transforming patient care in the residential setting through innovative solutions and technology-driven integrated care is largely achieved by our continuous efforts to ensure that we prioritize fostering an inclusive environment that helps our people and our patients achieve success. Our culture is designed to unlock the potential, skills, engagement and creativity of our people. Our Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, values and ethical business practices and policies directly impact workplace behavior and communication, and address discrimination and harassment, health and safety, and employee engagement, supporting talent attraction, retention, and development.\nOur board of directors and its committees provide general oversight on a range of our human capital management efforts. This includes environmental, social, and governance efforts addressed below.\nAs of June 30, 2025, we had approximately 10,600 employees, of which approximately 4,240 were employed in cost of sales activities including areas such as warehousing and manufacturing, 1,990 in research and development and 4,370 in sales, marketing and administration. Of our employees, approximately 3,250 (31%) were located in the U.S., Canada and Latin America, 3,250 (31%) in Asia, 1,570 (14%) in Australia and 2,530 (24%) in Europe. We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel that represent the world we live in, in every way. Resmed’s average global turnover rate for fiscal year 2025 was approximately 12%.\nOur Community\nWe are committed to the success of our employees and our patients. This commitment is integral to how we collaborate and communicate, in the policies we establish, and in our product design. Our dedication drives transformation in our patients' healthcare, improving lives globally. Our social sustainability team focuses on people practices, developing solutions and programs that enhance our business and brand success. Our objectives during this year focused on product design and raising awareness through discussions on accessibility design for our products. We also expanded global mentorship opportunities and offered quarterly micro-learnings on many topics. Additionally, our team broadened its outreach efforts, collaborating with employee resource groups, or ERGs, and global site leaders to create a global giving program supporting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, health, and sleep awareness initiatives.\nEmployee Resource Groups. \nWe continue to place a high value on initiatives that create community, learning and volunteer opportunities for our employees. Our global network comprises nineteen employee-driven ERGs that are instrumental in advancing the success of our patients and employees. On average, we host one event per week, accessible to all employees on a purely voluntary basis to encourage learning and community involvement.\nLearning and Development of Inclusion Values.\n Our leaders across the organization work directly with our People team to improve team dynamics and collaboration. We offer various resources for leaders to leverage in their workshops and sessions. Over the past year, we sustained and expanded the reach of our global mentorship initiatives and launched a reverse mentorship program fostering intergenerational learning with work and technology. We also delivered enterprise-wide trainings and quarterly learning sessions.\nStrategic Inclusive Development.\n Every year, employees apply or are nominated by their leaders to sit on our global council that advises on, and promotes, our inclusion efforts. The council aims to share developments and gather feedback from representatives across a wide representation of functions and office locations. We are also actively defining and streamlining internal language and partnerships in product design, medical research, mask testing, social media, and patient outreach to ensure accessibility and inclusivity are prioritized.\nLeadership Engagement.\n E\nach ERG is supported by one to two Executives that serve as a network of champions and help kick off events, attend, advertise, and share learnings with their wider teams. They meet collectively every quarter to share impressions, give feedback, and provide ideas on the goal of developing our people. \n-22-\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCommunity Outreach & Giving Back. \nThis year, we expanded our community support efforts by designing a giving program to better track and report our efforts, ensuring we provide meaningful support to the communities surrounding our offices.\nSourcing and Recruiting. \nWe train our recruiting workforce on the importance of building a talent pipeline that fosters creativity and ingenuity by leveraging various skill sets. Our outreach efforts included community partnerships with various organizations and schools focused on STEM, encouraging careers in these fields and at Resmed. In addition, we are continually improving our talent dashboard to better understand our metrics around applicants, candidates and the current workforce. We comply with global laws preventing discrimination in hiring practices. We do not employ the use of quotas or required hiring targets.\nTalent Development and Retention\nAt Resmed, developing our people is central to achieving our strategic ambitions and delivering on our purpose. We believe that building and strengthening our talent pipeline is essential to sustaining a high-performance culture—one where individuals thrive, and teams drive results. Our approach to talent and performance is anchored in continuous feedback. Regular conversations between managers and team members ensure alignment on performance goals, professional development, and career aspirations. These ongoing dialogues are intended to support individual development while reinforcing a shared commitment to excellence.\nWe support career growth through specific technical and management career pathways. These pathways are developed in collaboration with operational leaders, human resource partners, and learning specialists to ensure relevance and impact. Employees are empowered to take charge of their own development through curated online learning journeys tailored to their roles, with formal tracking to monitor progress and outcomes. In addition, we have both online and face-to-face training on critical topics such as operational compliance, health and safety, and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Topics also include compliance with laws against discrimination and international compliance standards like the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. \nCompensation and Benefits\nOur rewards philosophy reinforces and aligns with our mission, business strategy, and financial needs as we grow. We provide market-competitive compensation and benefits informed by external benchmarks as well as employee feedback. We execute our philosophy based on performance principles of fairness and consistency. Our annual and long-term incentives are linked directly to business performance and outcomes, as well as shareholder value creation. We offer an employee stock purchase plan globally, as well as recognition rewards catered to localized market practices. Eligibility for non-salary benefits such as salary continuance, life insurance, retirement, health insurance, and other benefits, are also aligned to local regulations and practices. \nEmployee Health and Safety \nWe believe that maintaining a physically safe, and mentally healthy, working environment is essential in supporting our people to deliver their best work. We employ global standards to provide the framework for our locally compliant, integrated and effective health and safety management systems which enable the capability, autonomy & accountability of the leaders to manage local sites. This year, we enhanced our resources dedicated to mental health and psychological safety in the workplace. Our approach is to prioritize health and safety as a positive contributor to innovation, continuous improvement and business sustainability through focusing on making work easier, which in turn makes work safer and more efficient. \nEmployee Engagement and Wellbeing\nWe regularly seek employee feedback and sentiment about our workplace through annual global engagement surveys that enable our people to rate and comment on matters related to their employment experience. We openly share the survey results throughout the company and encourage leaders to put in place action plans at global and local levels to address priority issues. Where benchmarks are available, our results are evaluated against comparable peer groups. \nWe are committed to improving the quality of life of our employees and their families.

It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.\nWe are a global leader in the development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloud-based software applications that diagnose, treat and manage respiratory disorders, including sleep disordered breathing, or SDB, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. SDB includes obstructive sleep apnea and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. Our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings. Our digital cloud-based health software applications, along with our devices, are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers.\nSince the development of continuous positive airway pressure therapy, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, and cloud-based software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes. Our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion, our research and product development efforts, acquisitions and an increasing awareness of SDB and respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as significant health concerns. \nWe are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. During fiscal year 2025, we invested $331.3 million on research and development activities, which represents 6.4% of net revenues with a continued focus on the development and commercialization of new, innovative products and solutions that improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers and help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and lower healthcare costs. For example, our newest device, AirSense 11, introduced new features such as a touch screen, algorithms for patients new to therapy, digital enhancements and over-the-air update capabilities. Our operations include residential care software platforms designed to support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. These platforms comprise our Residential Care Software business and, along with our cloud-based remote monitoring and therapy management system, and a robust product pipeline, these products should continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth. \nWe have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry, or Sleep and Breathing Health, and the supply of business management software as a service to residential healthcare providers, or Residential Care Software. During fiscal year 2025, we renamed our operating segments from Sleep and Respiratory Care to Sleep and Breathing Health and from Software as a Service to Residential Care Software in alignment with our 2030 strategy.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a “constant currency basis”, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. To calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. However, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to United States, or U.S., dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.\nFor discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 compared to fiscal year June 30, 2023, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year Ended June 30, 2024, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on August 9, 2024.\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2025 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024\nNet Revenues \nNet revenue for the year ended June 30, 2025 increased to $5,146.3 million from $4,685.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $461.0 million or 10% (a 10% increase on a constant currency basis).

Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, masks and other sales increased by 11%, compared to the year ended June 30, 2024.\nResidential Care Software\nNet revenue from our Residential Care Software business for the year ended June 30, 2025 was $641.4 million, compared to $584.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $57.3 million or 10%. The increase was driven by continued growth in the Home Medical Equipment, or HME, and MEDIFOX DAN verticals within our Residential Care Software business.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin. \nGross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2025 to $3,055.0 million from $2,655.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $399.7 million or 15%. Gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, was 59.4% for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared with the 56.7% for the year ended June 30, 2024. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to procurement, manufacturing and logistics efficiencies, $14.3 million of combined expenses associated with the field safety notifications for masks with magnets and Astral devices recognized during the year ended June 30, 2024, as well as a reduction in the amortization of acquired intangibles during the year ended June 30, 2025. The masks with magnets field safety notification expenses relate to estimated \ncosts to provide alternative masks to patients in response to updated contraindications for use of masks that incorporate magnets. \nThe Astral field safety notification expenses relate to estimated costs associated with the replacement of a certain component in some of our Astral ventilation devices that were manufactured between 2013 to 2019. \nOperating Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our operating expenses (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30,\nChange\n% Change\nConstant Currency\n2025\n2024\nSelling, general, and administrative\n$\n991,019 \n$\n917,136 \n$\n73,883 \n8 \n%\n8 \n%\nas a % of net revenue\n19.3 \n%\n19.6 \n%\nResearch and development \n$\n331,284 \n$\n307,525 \n$\n23,759 \n8 \n%\n8 \n%\nas a % of net revenue\n6.4 \n%\n6.6 \n%\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n$\n45,273 \n$\n46,521 \n$\n(1,248)\n(3)\n%\n(3)\n%\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2025 to $991.0 million from $917.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $73.9 million or 8%.

As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2025 improved to 19.3% compared to 19.6% for the year ended June 30, 2024. \nThe constant currency increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the year ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs and marketing expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses \nResearch and development expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2025 to $331.3 million from $307.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $23.8 million or 8%. Research and development expenses were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $1.3 million, as reported in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2025 increased by 8% compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 6.4% for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to 6.6% for the year ended June 30, 2024. \nThe constant currency increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2025 was $45.3 million compared to $46.5 million for the year ended the year ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in amortization of acquired intangibles is due to certain acquired intangible assets reaching the end of their useful lives and becoming fully amortized, partially offset by increases from amortization of acquired intangibles associated with new acquisitions.\nRestructuring Expenses \nWe did not incur material restructuring expenses during the year ended June 30, 2025. During the year ended June 30, 2024, we incurred restructuring expenses of $64.2 million associated with an evaluation of our existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and increase profitability. Restructuring charges for the year ended June 30, 2024 were comprised of $28.6 million of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, $33.2 million of intangible asset impairments associated with the wind down of certain business activities, and $2.4 million of other miscellaneous asset impairments. \nTotal Other Income (Loss), Net\nThe following table summarizes our other income (loss) (in thousands):\nYear Ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\nInterest income (expense), net\n$\n4,114 \n$\n(45,708)\n$\n49,822 \nGain (loss) attributable to equity method investments\n3,644 \n(1,848)\n5,492 \nGain (loss) on equity investments\n(10,299)\n(4,045)\n(6,254)\nOther, net\n(5,256)\n(3,494)\n(1,762)\nTotal other income (loss), net\n$\n(7,797)\n$\n(55,095)\n$\n47,298 \nTotal other income (loss), net for the year ended June 30, 2025 was a loss of $7.8 million, compared to a loss of $55.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. We recorded interest income, net, of $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to interest expense, net of $45.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2024 due to lower debt levels following the repayment of our revolving credit facility and interest earned on cash balances. Losses associated with our investments in marketable and non-marketable equity securities were $10.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to a loss of $4.0 million or the year ended June 30, 2024. Losses associated with our investments in marketable and non-marketable equity securities were partially offset by a gain attributable to equity method investments for the year ended June 30, 2025 of $3.6 million, compared to a loss of $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. \n-57-\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 7\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIncome Taxes \nOur effective income tax rate decreased to 16.5% for the year ended June 30, 2025 from 19.3% for the year ended June 30, 2024. Our effective rate of 16.5% for the year ended June 30, 2025 differs from the statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to interest and penalties refunded by the IRS in relation to certain amended returns, tax benefits realized from the cessation of certain business activities, along with research credits and foreign operations. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2025 was primarily due to the IRS refund of interest and penalties and tax benefits realized from the cessation of certain business activities. \nOur Singapore operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through June 30, 2030. As a result of the TCJA, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable during the year ended June 30, 2018. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax, if repatriated, except as discussed in Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8).\nThe Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Inclusive Framework) has put forth two proposals—Pillar One and Pillar Two—that (i) revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and (ii) ensure a minimal level of taxation, respectively. Effective in our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, various jurisdictions in which we operate began implementing the global minimum tax prescribed under Pillar Two. These changes in legislation did not have a material impact on our income tax expense and cash flows for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. \nOn June 28, 2025, the G7 issued a joint statement in which its members agreed that Pillar Two will operate alongside the U.S. system of tax and proposed that U.S.-parented multinational groups would not be subject to the income inclusion rules and undertaxed profits rules of Pillar Two. The remaining OECD countries are likely to consider changes to existing and proposed tax laws to align with the recommendations and guidelines proposed by G7. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impacts of the Inclusive Framework for future periods.\nNet Income and Earnings per Share\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, our net income for the year ended June 30, 2025 was $1,400.7 million compared to net income of $1,021.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. Our earnings per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2025 was $9.51 compared to $6.92 for the year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 37%. \nSummary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, in evaluating the performance of our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide investors better insight when evaluating our performance from core operations and can provide more consistent financial reporting across periods. For these reasons, we use non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. \nThe measure “non-GAAP cost of sales” is equal to GAAP cost of sales less amortization of acquired intangible assets relating to cost of sales and field safety notification expenses. The masks with magnets field safety notification expenses relate to estimated \ncosts to provide alternative masks to patients in response to updated contraindications for use of masks that incorporate magnets. \nThe Astral field safety notification expenses relate to estimated costs associated with the replacement of a certain component in some of our Astral ventilation devices that were manufactured between 2013 to 2019. The measure “non-GAAP gross profit” is the difference between GAAP net revenue and non-GAAP cost of sales, and “non-GAAP gross margin” is the ratio of non-GAAP gross profit to GAAP net revenue. \n-58-\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 7\nRESMED INC.

Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development activities, selling and marketing activities, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments, share repurchases, dividend payments and repayment of debt obligations. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of several factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, which include supply chain disruptions, working capital requirements and capital deployment decisions.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate in net revenue, third-party reimbursement of our products for our customers, the timing and extent of spending to support research development efforts, the expansion of selling, general and administrative activities, the timing of introductions of new products, the expenditures associated with possible future acquisitions, investments or other business combination transactions. As we assess inorganic growth strategies, we may need to supplement our internally generated cash flow with outside sources. If we are required to access the debt market, we believe that we will be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our current level of earnings and cash flow generation as well as our ability to access the market considering those earning levels. \nAs of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,209.5 million and $238.4 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents held within the U.S. at June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024 were $555.0 million and $51.2 million, respectively. Our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, were $654.5 million and $187.2 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions.\nAs of June 30, 2025, we had up to $1,500.0 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility and a combined total of $2,709.5 million in cash and available liquidity under the revolving credit facility. \nWe repatriated $1,050.0 million and $800.0 million to the U.S. during the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, from earnings generated in each of those years. The amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the U.S. in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2025 will be determined, based on a variety of factors, including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign \n-60-\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 7\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ninvestment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the U.S., such as for the repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and other domestic obligations.\nAs a result of the TCJA, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable, which resulted in additional tax expense of $92.4 million which was payable over the proceeding eight years. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax if repatriated, except as discussed in Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8).\nWe believe that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations, including expected capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond.\nRevolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes\nOn June 29, 2022, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement, or as amended from time to time, the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement, among other things, provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $1,500.0 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional amount equal to the greater of $1,000.0 million or 1.0 times the EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month measurement period. Additionally, on June 29, 2022, ResMed Pty Limited entered into a Second Amendment to the Syndicated Facility Agreement, or the Term Credit Agreement. The Term Credit Agreement, among other things, provides ResMed Pty Limited a senior unsecured term credit facility of $200.0 million. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each terminate on Jun 29, 2027, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. As of June 30, 2025, we had $1,500.0 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility.\nOn July 10, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.24% senior notes due July 10, 2026, and $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.45% senior notes due July 10, 2029, or the Senior Notes. \nOn June 30, 2025, there was a total of $670.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes. We expect to satisfy all of our liquidity and long-term debt requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt facilities.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in thousands):\n \n \nYear Ended June 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,751,588 \n$\n1,401,260 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(200,045)\n(269,784)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(606,253)\n(1,119,287)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash\n25,799 \n(1,719)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n971,089 \n$\n10,470 \nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $1,751.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to cash provided of $1,401.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. The $350.3 million increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to increased net income, partially offset by higher working capital during the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. During the year ended June 30, 2025, our operating cash flows included $124.4 million of income tax refunds and associated interest and penalties.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $200.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to cash used of $269.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. The $69.7 million decrease in cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to net proceeds from maturity of foreign currency contracts during the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to net \n-61-\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 7\nRESMED INC.

We repurchased $300.0 million of treasury stock during the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to repurchases of $150.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2024. Cash outflows for treasury stock repurchases were offset by lower net repayments under our Revolving Credit Agreement of $40.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to net repayments of $730.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. \nDividends\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2025, we paid cash dividends of $2.12 per common share totaling $310.9 million. On July 31, 2025, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.60 per common share, to be paid on September 18, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 14, 2025. Future dividends are subject to approval by our board of directors.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nDetails of contractual obligations at June 30, 2025 are as follows (in thousands): \nPayments Due by June 30,\nTotal\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\nThereafter\nDebt\n$\n670,775 \n$\n10,775 \n$\n410,000 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n250,000 \n$\n— \nInterest on debt\n59,788 \n25,344 \n16,954 \n8,625 \n8,625 \n240 \n— \nOperating leases\n224,945 \n41,131 \n34,688 \n28,347 \n26,242 \n20,633 \n73,904 \nPurchase obligations\n963,763 \n927,365 \n26,090 \n4,430 \n2,339 \n2,154 \n1,385 \nTotal \n$\n1,919,271 \n$\n1,004,615 \n$\n487,732 \n$\n41,402 \n$\n37,206 \n$\n273,027 \n$\n75,289 \nDetails of other commercial commitments at June 30, 2025 are as follows (in thousands): \nAmount of Commitment Expiration Per Period\nTotal\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\nThereafter\nStandby letter of credit\n$\n11,985 \n$\n4,087 \n$\n91 \n$\n— \n$\n313 \n$\n30 \n$\n7,464 \nGuarantees*\n4,719 \n4,617 \n7 \n27 \n33 \n2 \n33 \nTotal \n$\n16,704 \n$\n8,704 \n$\n98 \n$\n27 \n$\n346 \n$\n32 \n$\n7,497 \n*\nThese guarantees mainly relate to requirements under contractual obligations with insurance companies transacting with our German subsidiaries and guarantees provided under our facility leasing obligations.\nRefer to Note 15 – Legal Actions, Contingencies and Commitments of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for details of our contingent obligations under recourse provisions.\nSegment Information \nWe have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the Sleep and Breathing Health segment and the Residential Care Software segment. See Note 13 – Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting. Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCritical Accounting Principles and Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and \n-62-\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 7\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nliabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty obligations, goodwill, potentially impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies.\nWe state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: \n(1)\nValuation of Goodwill. \nWe make assumptions in establishing the carrying value and fair value of our goodwill. Our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. The criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of the assets in our business objectives. If goodwill is considered to be impaired, we recognize as an impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value, limited to the value of goodwill allocated to the impaired reporting unit, as described in Step 1 below. Factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries. \nWe conduct an annual review for goodwill impairment at our reporting unit level based on the following steps: \nStep 0 or Qualitative assessment – Evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance or events-specific to that reporting unit. If or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, we would move to Step 1 of the quantitative method.\nStep 1 – Compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary.\nDuring the annual reviews for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, we completed a Step 0 or Qualitative assessment and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill, and therefore goodwill was not impaired.\n(2)\nIncome Tax. \nManagement judgment is required in determining our income tax provision, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the current period or subsequent periods.\nWe maintain valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. The realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future, particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected, or if we take operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary.\n-63-\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 7\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes on a quarterly basis. Based on our assessment, we may adjust the income tax provision, deferred taxes and valuation allowances in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.\nTax years 2018 to 2024 remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax.\n(3)\nRevenue Recognition. \nWe have determined that we have two operating segments, which are Sleep and Breathing Health and Residential Care Software. For products in our Sleep and Breathing Health business, we transfer control and recognize a sale when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contractual shipping terms. For our Residential Care Software business, revenue associated with cloud-hosted services are recognized as they are provided. Unbilled receivables arise when revenue is recognized for goods or services transferred but the customer has not yet been invoiced, typically due to billing terms or timing differences. We defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received when performance obligations are not yet satisfied. Consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our Sleep and Breathing Health business relate primarily to extended warranties on our devices and the provision of data for patient monitoring. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our Residential Care Software business relate primarily to the provision of software access with maintenance and support over an agreed term and material rights associated with future discounts upon renewal of some Residential Care Software contracts. Generally, deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one to five years. Our contracts do not contain significant financing components.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. In our Sleep and Breathing Health segment, the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies with changes in marketing incentives (e.g. rebates, discounts, free goods) and returns by our customers and their customers. When we give customers the right to return eligible products and receive credit, returns are estimated based on an analysis of our historical experience. Returns of products, excluding warranty-related returns, have historically been infrequent and insignificant. We adjust the estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated, the amount expected to be received changes, or when the consideration becomes fixed.\nWe offer our Sleep and Breathing Health customers cash or product rebates based on volume or sales targets measured over quarterly or annual periods. We estimate rebates based on each customer’s expected achievement of its targets. In accounting for these rebate programs, we reduce revenue ratably as sales occur over the rebate period by the expected value of the rebates to be returned to the customer. Rebates measured over a quarterly period are updated based on actual sales results and, therefore, no estimation is required to determine the reduction to revenue. For rebates measured over annual periods, we update our estimates each quarter based on actual sales results and updated forecasts for the remaining rebate periods. \nWe participate in programs where we issue credits to our Sleep and Breathing Health distributors when they are required to sell our products below negotiated list prices if we have preexisting contracts with the distributors' customers. We reduce revenue for future credits at the time of sale to the distributor, which we estimate based on historical experience using the expected value method. \nWe also offer discounts to both our Sleep and Breathing Health as well as our Residential Care Software customers as part of normal business practice and these are deducted from revenue when the sale occurs.\nWhen Sleep and Breathing Health or Residential Care Software contracts have multiple performance obligations, we generally use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price by reference to pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately to similar customers. Revenue is then allocated proportionately, based on the determined stand-alone selling price, to each performance obligation. An allocation is not \n-64-\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 7\nRESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nrequired for many of our Sleep and Breathing Health contracts that have a single performance obligation, which is the shipment of our therapy-based equipment.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \nAs of June 30, 2025, we are not involved in any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as described in Instruction 8 to Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.\n-65-\nTable of Contents\nPART II",
