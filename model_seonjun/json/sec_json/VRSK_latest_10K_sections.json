Using advanced technologies to collect and analyze billions of records, we draw on unique data assets, insurance industry knowledge, and technological expertise to provide valuable solutions that are integrated into client workflows. We offer predictive analytics and decision support solutions to clients in rating, underwriting, claims, catastrophe, weather risk, and many other fields. In the United States (“U.S.”) and around the world, we help clients protect individuals, communities, and businesses. We completed the sale of our Energy business on February 1, 2023. We also divested our specialized markets and financial services businesses in March 2022 and April 2022, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur clients use our solutions to make better decisions about risk and improve operating efficiency. We refer to these products and services as solutions due to the integration among our services and the flexibility that enables our clients to purchase components or a comprehensive package. These solutions take various forms, including proprietary data assets, expert industry insight, statistical models, tailored analytic objects, and robust software platforms all designed to allow our clients to make more informed risk decisions. We believe our solutions for analyzing risk have a positive impact on our clients’ revenues and help them better manage their costs. In 2024, our clients included all of the top 100 property and casualty (\"P&C\") insurance providers in the U.S. for the lines of P&C services we offer. We believe that our commitment to our clients and the embedded nature of our solutions serve to strengthen and extend our relationships.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe believe that Verisk is uniquely positioned with a series of competitive advantages including:\n\n\n \n\n\n• \nProprietary Data Assets\n – Data is at the core of what we do. We use our proprietary and contributory data assets to develop predictive analytics and transformative models for our clients;\n\n\n \n\n\n• \nDeep Insurance Industry Expertise and Focus\n – We have specialized and in-depth knowledge in insurance and risk management that drives our engagement with our clients;\n\n\n \n\n\n• \nLong-standing Industry Relationships\n – Our early beginnings as an insurance rating bureau have established us as a trusted partner for the industry as well as a source of insights for our clients; and\n\n\n \n\n\n• \nScale to Drive Broad Distribution of Innovation \n– Our scale advantage enables us to innovate on behalf of the insurance industry and deliver solutions that strive to solve our clients’ biggest challenges.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Business Strategy\n\n\n \n\n\nOur vision is to be the leading strategic data, analytics, and technology partner to the global insurance industry by delivering value to our clients through knowledge, expertise, and scale. Our business aims to build upon our competitive advantages and capitalizing on our scale and position within the industry. Our business strategy is driven by the following priorities:\n\n\n \n\n\n• \nDrive Consistent & Predictable Growth.\n With our clear focus on insurance, integrated organization and our client-centric and results-oriented culture, we strive to deliver consistent and predictable growth. We are leveraging our strong client relationships to extend our reach within insurance and elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients. We are modernizing and advancing the capabilities of our core solutions using cloud technology and advanced analytical methods including machine learning and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") while also augmenting our solutions through the addition of new data assets and sources. In addition, we are working on building leadership positions in adjacent markets including life insurance, marketing, specialty business solutions, and resilience and sustainability. With the client at the center of all we do, we are driving innovation across our portfolio and partnering with our clients to help solve the insurance industry's greatest challenges with a focus on rapidly changing technology, growing regulatory focus, and value creation;\n\n\n \n\n\n• \nDrive Operating Efficiency and Profitability.\n Our subscription business model as well as our ability to build solutions that serve the insurance industry at large helps drive core operating leverage. In addition, we strive to deliver productivity enhancements and operating efficiency through the use of advanced technology and a global talent workforce. We seek to balance this with high return on capital investment into the business to continue to drive growth and profitability; and\n\n\n \n\n\n• Ensure Disciplined Capital Allocation. \nWe are focused on generating strong cash flow and ensuring that we are disciplined in how we allocate that capital with a focus on directing capital to the highest return investments. First, we prioritize organic reinvestment in the business, which can produce high internal returns. Second, we look for selective, strategic acquisitions that can expand our data assets, augment our capabilities, and expand our reach within the insurance industry while also creating value by leveraging our capabilities and resources. Finally, we expect to return excess capital to shareholders while also maintaining a strong balance sheet.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      4\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur History\n\n\n \n\n\nWe trace our history to 1971, when Insurance Services Office, Inc. (\"ISO\") started operations as a not-for-profit advisory and rating organization providing services to the U.S. P&C insurance industry. ISO was formed as an association of insurance companies to gather statistical data and other information from insurers and report to regulators, as required by law. ISO’s original functions also included developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance solutions and providing information to help insurers determine their own independent premium rates. Insurers used and continue to use our offerings primarily in their product development, underwriting, and rating functions.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), ISO formed Verisk Analytics, Inc. (\"Verisk\"), a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business. Verisk was initially formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of ISO. On October 6, 2009, in connection with our IPO, we effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a wholly owned subsidiary of Verisk. Verisk common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on October 7, 2009, under the ticker symbol “VRSK.”\n\n\n \n\n\nSegments\n\n\n \n\n\nOur operating segments have historically been Insurance, Energy and Specialized Markets, and Financial Services. On March 11, 2022 and April 8, 2022, we sold 3E Company Environmental, Ecological and Engineering (\"3E\"), our environmental health and safety business, which represented the “specialized markets” in our Energy and Specialized Markets segment, and our Financial Services segment, respectively. We assessed the sale of 3E and Financial Services segment per the guidance in ASC 205-20, \nDiscontinued Operations \n(\"ASC 205-20\"), and determined that the transactions did not qualify as a discontinued operation because they did not, quantitatively or qualitatively, represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. On October 28, 2022, we also entered into an equity purchase agreement to sell Wood Mackenzie, Inc. and Verisk New UK Holdco LP (together with their respective subsidiaries, our “Energy business”). The transaction closed on February 1, 2023. The Energy business qualified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2022 and was classified as a discontinued operation per the guidance in ASC 205-20, as we determined that this transaction represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and assets and liabilities held for sale for all periods presented. Results of our Energy business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for all prior periods presented. See \nNote 11\n. Dispositions and Discontinued Operation for further discussion.\n\n\n \n\n\nInsurance Segment\n\n\n \n\n\nWe now operate in one segment, Insurance, which primarily serves our P&C insurance customers across most personal and commercial lines of business, focusing on the fundamental building blocks of insurance programs, the prediction of loss, the selection and pricing of risk, and compliance with their reporting requirements in each U.S. state in which they operate. We also develop and utilize machine-learned and artificially intelligent models to forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized analytics that help our customers better manage their businesses, including detecting fraud before and after a loss event and quantifying losses. Our customers, acquired over more than 50 years, include most of the P&C insurance providers in the U.S. In recent years, we have expanded our offerings to serve certain non-U.S. markets and into the fields of life insurance and annuities, as well as insurance marketing. We offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term agreements, which are typically prepaid (annually and quarterly) and represented approximately 81% of our revenues in 2024. We believe we are well positioned to increase our penetration of the global insurance industry because of our proprietary data assets, long-standing industry relationships, deep insurance industry expertise, and our scale to drive broad distribution of our new innovations.\n\n\n \n\n\nUnderwriting\n\n\n \n\n\nPowered by proprietary and contributory data and advanced analytics and technologies, we offer a full suite of solutions to support our P&C clients across the insurance policy lifecycle. This support spans their product development, marketing, new and renewal underwriting, risk selection and segmentation, pricing, and straight through to policy binding and issuance. We continued to grow our presence internationally and expand our capabilities into new markets, such as life insurance and annuities, and into new workflows, such as marketing and customer acquisition.\n\n\n \n\n\nForms, Rules, and Loss Costs \n\n\n \n\n\nWe are the recognized leader in the U.S. for industry-standard insurance programs that help P&C insurers define coverages and issue policies. We provide policy language, prospective loss costs, policy writing and rating rules, and a variety of underwriting solutions for risk selection and segmentation, pricing, and workflow optimization across \n31 lines of insurance. Our policy language, prospective loss cost information, and policy writing rules can serve as integrated, turnkey insurance programs for our clients.\n\n\n \n\n\nInsurance companies need to ensure that their policy language, rules, and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. They must also make sure their policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in response to changes in statutes, case law, or regulatory requirements. To meet our clients’ needs, we process approximately 2,000 regulatory filings and interface with state regulators in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands each year to ensure smooth implementation of our rules and forms. When insurers choose to develop their own alternative programs, our industry-standard insurance programs also help regulators ensure that such insurers’ policies meet basic coverage requirements.\n\n\n \n\n\nStandardized coverage language, which has been tested in litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation, helps ensure consistent treatment of claimants. As a result, our industry-standard language also simplifies claim settlements and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation because our language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become established and known. Our policy language includes standard coverage language, endorsements, and policy writing support language that assist our clients in understanding the risks they assume and the coverages they offer. With these policy programs, insurers also benefit from economies of scale. We have more than 240 insurance experts and specialized lawyers reviewing changes in each state’s insurance rules and regulations, including an average of approximately 12,300 legislative actions, 16,000 regulatory actions, and 2,000 court decisions per year, to make any required changes to our policy language and rating information.\n\n\n \n\n\nTo cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace, we offer a broad range of policy programs. For example, in the homeowners line of insurance, we maintain policy language and rules for approximately 6 basic coverages, 385 national endorsements, and 701 state-specific endorsements.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      5\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe P&C insurance industry is heavily regulated in the U.S.; P&C insurers are required to collect statistical data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to regulators in every state in which they operate. Our statistical agent services have enabled P&C insurers to meet those regulatory requirements for more than 50 years.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe aggregate the data, and as a l\nicensed or appointed “statistical agent” in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, we rep\nort those statistics to insurance regulators. We are able to capture significant economies of scale given the level of penetration of this service within the U.S. P&C insurance industry.\n\n\n \n\n\nTo provide our clients and the regulators with the information they require, we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world. Over the past five decades, we have developed core expertise in acquiring, processing, managing, protecting, and operating large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our insurance offerings. We use our proprietary technology to assemble, organize, and update vast amounts of detailed information submitted by our clients. We supplement this data with publicly available information.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn 2024, P&C insurers sent us approximately 2.7 billion detailed individual records of insurance transactions, such as insurance premiums collected or losses incurred. We maintain an underwriting database of more than 36.3 billion statistical records, including approximately 9.7 billion commercial lines records and approximately 26 billion personal lines records. We collect unit transaction detail of each premium and loss record, which enhances the validity, reliability, and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial analyses. Across all of our insurance lines, our proprietary quality process includes approximately 3,000 separate checks to ensure that the data meets our high standards.\n\n\n \n\n\nUsing our large database of premium and loss data, we provide actuarial services to help our clients analyze and price their risks. Our actuaries are able to perform sophisticated analyses using our predictive models and analytic methods to help our P&C insurance clients with pricing, loss reserving, and market analysis. We distribute a number of actuarial solutions and offer flexible services to meet our clients’ needs. In addition, our actuarial consultants provide customized services for our clients that include assisting them with the development of independent insurance programs, analysis of their own underwriting experience, development of classification systems and rating plans, and a wide variety of other business decisions. We also supply information to various clients in other markets, including reinsurance and government agencies.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe project clients' future losses and loss expenses using a broad set of data. Those projections tend to be more reliable than if our clients used their own data exclusively. We make a number of actuarial adjustments before the data is used to estimate future costs. Our clients can use our estimates of future costs in making independent decisions about the prices charged for their policies. For most P&C insurers in most lines of business, we believe that our estimates of future costs are an essential input to rating decisions. Our actuarial solutions and services are also used to create the analytics underlying our industry-standard insurance programs described above.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn response to the challenges faced by our clients to reduce operating complexity and improve their speed to market, we are undertaking an extensive modernization of our core lines product. This “reimagine” of our forms, rules, loss costs and related solutions is designed to deliver increased value to our customers. The Reimagine program includes significant enhancements to our existing solutions; new digital workflow tools, insights, and analytics; and an enhanced content delivery platform.\n\n\n \n\n\nUnderwriting Data and Analytics Solutions \n\n\n \n\n\nWe gather information on individual properties, vehicles and communities providing the breadth and depth of data and analytics needed to support our clients as they evaluate, segment, and price personal and commercial insurance, as well as commercial liability insurance, throughout the policy lifecycle. Our property- and auto- specific rating and underwriting information allows our clients to understand, quantify, underwrite, mitigate, and avoid potential loss for these risks.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur database contains data and analytics on approximately 143 million residential properties and 16 million commercial properties in the U.S. We have a staff of approximately 500 field representatives strategically located around the U.S. who observe and report on conditions at commercial and residential properties, evaluate community fire-protection capabilities, and assess the effectiveness of municipal building-code enforcement. Each year, our field staff visits approximately 300,000 commercial properties to collect information on new buildings, verify building attributes, and provide specific loss costs. Our auto solutions are powered by a mix of third-party and proprietary data ranging from 2 billion traffic court records to characteristics on more than 275 million insured drivers and 280 million registered vehicles with access to expansive industry databases on loss costs and claims.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are a leading provider of innovative solutions for the personal underwriting markets, including homeowners and auto lines. Drawing on an array of resources from proprietary and third-party data to geospatial imagery, we build and maintain widely used industry-standard tools that assist insurers in underwriting and rating—that is, measuring and selecting risks and pricing coverage appropriately to help ensure fairness to the consumer and a reasonable return for the insurer. Our solutions apply advanced predictive analytics to our deep reservoir of data and information to gauge the degree and cost of risk quickly and precisely, and our workflow tools help insurers increase speed and cost-efficiency while enhancing customer experiences. These solutions span a range of applications—from using precise home reconstruction costs to help policyholders have the right amount of coverage, to providing auto insurers with the data that supports offering consumers a bindable quote in minutes through modern API’s.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe also provide proprietary analytic measures of the ability of individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils. Nearly every property insurer in the U.S. uses our evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country. We provide field-verified and validated data on fire protection services for approximately 36,000 fire response jurisdictions. We\n also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to mitigate damage from flooding.\n\n\n \n\n\nFurther, we provide information on the insurance rating territories, premium taxes, crime risk, and hazards of windstorm, earthquake, wildfire, and other perils. To supplement our data on specific commercial properties and individual communities, we have assembled, from a variety of internal and third-party sources, information on hazards related to geographic locations representing every postal address in the U.S. Insurers use this information not only for policy quoting but also for analyzing risk concentration in geographical areas. We also make our data and analytics available to commercial real estate lenders to allow them to better understand risks associated with people to whom they lend.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      6\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExtreme Event Solutions\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe are a leader in and pioneered the field of probabilistic catastrophe modeling used by insurers, reinsurers, intermediaries, financial institutions, and governments to manage their risk from extreme events. Our models, which form the basis of our solutions, enable companies to identify, quantify, and plan for the financial consequences of catastrophes. We have developed models for hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, and floods in more than 120 countries and territories. We have developed a probabilistic terrorism model capable of quantifying the risk in the U.S. from this evolving threat, which supports pricing and underwriting decisions down to the level of an individual policy, as well as models for estimating losses to crop insurance programs in the U.S., Canada, India, and China. Our newest models offer risk quantification solutions for the casualty line of business.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe offer global risk intelligence providing insight into sustainability and resilience issues, underpinned by geospatial data and analytics. We provide intelligence on sustainability, resilience, human rights, environmental, sovereign and political risk, stitching together these disparate issues into an interconnected global view built upon objective insight and data.\n\n\n \n\n\nUp until the sale of Atmospheric and Environmental Research (“AER”) on December 2, 2024, we helped businesses and governments better anticipate and monitor risks in Earth’s natural environment. We prepared certain agencies and companies to anticipate, manage, react to, and profit from climate- and weather-related risk. We served our customers by providing advanced research, development, and analysis delivered in reports, data streams, and software solutions.\n\n\n \n\n\nLife Insurance Solutions\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIn recent years we have expanded our offerings to also serve the life insurance and annuities markets through our 2019 acquisition of FAST. Life Insurance Solutions enable new approaches across the policy life cycle through no-code technology, data analytics, and modeling. We have developed a suite of solutions that apply advanced analytics, automation, and machine learning to existing and emerging data sources. Our solutions are designed to help transform current workflows in life insurance underwriting, claim insights, policy administration, unclaimed property/equity, compliance and fraud detection, and actuarial and portfolio modeling. Our industry-leading FAST platform can reduce time to market, enables faster policy conversion, and can reduce information technology costs for our customers, uniquely positioning us to help support the modernization of the life insurance industry.\n\n\n \n\n\nSpecialty Business Solutions\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe are a leading software supplier to the global specialty insurance market with particular focus on the London specialty market where we have a long-standing client base. Our powerful software suite, coupled with our vast datasets, experience, and technology allows our clients to grow and better manage their business with greater efficiency, flexibility, and data governance. Our solutions serve insurers, (re)insurers, brokers, cover holders, and managing general agents (MGAs) in London and across the globe.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe help drive the success of many of the fastest growing insurance and reinsurance specialists by providing full end-to-end management of insurance and reinsurance business. Our suite of software solutions covers a broad range of insurance processes from policy negotiation and placement, pricing and policy administration through to claims and outwards reinsurance.\n\n\n \n\n\nMany of our solutions can be integrated with one another and with capabilities across the organization to meet evolving client needs and offer a compelling digital ecosystem for the London and global insurance market. To that end, our global marketplace solution offers seamless real-time quote-to-bind electronic placing and distribution for the specialty insurance market.\n\n\n \n\n\nMarketing Solutions\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThrough recent acquisitions, we extended our data and workflow capabilities to help the global insurance industry drive improvement in customer acquisition, growth, and retention. Marketing and advertising spend for insurers goes well beyond $10 billion and has continued to increase year over year. We possess unique and proven data sets that help the insurance industry more precisely segment, target, and optimize advertising and marketing spend. Solutions include compliant, real-time decisioning, profitability, and risk assessment (pre-quote and pre-underwriting) for inbound consumer interactions. We also power ongoing enrichment of prospective and current customer insights for the highest probability of retention and increased share of wallet (policy bundling) as well as full coverage of U.S. households and consumers to drive prospect marketing and advertising strategies. Verisk Marketing Solutions brings a unique insurance-focused, specialized offering that covers insurance carriers’ holistic marketing data needs.\n\n\n \n\n\nInternational Underwriting Solutions\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe continue to expand our footprint of data and solutions to include international markets. Our international insurance markets grew through acquisitions and today serve a large number of insurers operating in the Canadian, United Kingdom (U.K.) and Irish property and casualty markets, and travel market. Additionally, our international market provides services to much of the Lloyd's of London market, while also serving clients in Continental Europe, Singapore, China, Australia, and New Zealand. The international enhanced commercial and residential property models and enriched data sets help insurers with triage, reconstruction value, risk selection, pricing, benchmarking, and portfolio management across multiple insured segments. Insurers also use our solutions to help fine-tune the accuracy of their rating models and to enhance underwriting results through a set of analytical solutions that predict the relative risk and variation of major insurance perils, including theft, flood, storm, fire, freeze, etc. In addition to property data and solutions, clients can benefit from decision and benchmarking analytics using firmographic, technographic, and business intelligence and proprietary management competency scores, delivered digitally to enable straight through processing. Our suite of international solutions also includes rating tools that automate the assessment of pre-existing conditions, helping travel and health insurers to get a broad view of a customer's medical risk and make underwriting decisions with speed and precision.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      7\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClaims \n\n\n \n\n\nOur claims insurance solutions provide our customers analytics in fraud detection, compliance reporting, subrogation liability assessment, litigation, and repair cost estimation and valuation, including emerging areas of interest within these categories.\n\n\n \n\n\nProperty Estimating Solutions \n\n\n \n\n\nWe also provide data, analytics, and networking solutions for professionals involved in estimating all phases of building repair and reconstruction. We provide solutions for every phase of a building’s life, including:\n\n\n \n\n\n• quantifying the ultimate cost of repair or reconstruction of damaged or destroyed buildings for personal and commercial properties;\n\n\n \n\n\n• aiding in the settlement of insurance claims; and\n\n\n \n\n\n• tracking the process of repair or reconstruction and facilitating communication among insurers, adjusters, contractors, and policyholders.\n\n\n \n\n\nTo help our customers estimate repair costs, we provide a solution that assists contractors and insurance adjusters in estimating repairs using a patented plan-sketching program that automatically calculates material and labor quantities for all desired construction or repairs to a structure based on use\nr inputs.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe also provide our customers access to price lists, which include structural repair and restoration pricing for 468 separate economic areas in North America based on direct market surveys and analysis of actual customer claim experience. We revise this information monthly, and as often as weekly in the aftermath of major disasters, to reflect rapid price changes. Our structural repair and cleaning database contains approximately 21,000 unit-cost line items. We estimate that more than 80% of insurance repair contractors and service providers in the U.S. and Canada with computerized estimating systems use our building and repair pricing data. This large percentage leads to accurate reporting of pricing information, which we believe is unmatched in the industry.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur virtual claims-adjusting tools help improve policyholder satisfaction, reduce human error, and save on loss adjustment expense. These tools simplify collaboration among claims professionals, contractors, and policyholders as they work together remotely and efficiently. These cloud-based and on-premise solutions include real-time video collaboration, remote measuring tools, generative AI-powered damage assessment, and image analytics fraud warnings, among other features.\n\n\n \n\n\nCustomers access our ecosystem for enhanced claims handling and analysis. For example, they can use our weather API for near-real-time updates and valuable insights for responding to weather perils that can impact their policyholders and their business. They can also use our data insights to analyze and benchmark their performance against peers in the industry and to manage claims assignments.\n\n\n \n\n\nAnti-Fraud Solutions\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe are a leading provider of fraud-detection tools for the P&C insurance industry. Our anti-fraud solutions can improve our customers’ profitability by predicting the likelihood that fraud may be occurring and by detecting suspicious activity after it has occurred.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur claims database lends significant support to the fight against insurance fraud. The database contains in\nformation from more than 1.8 billion claim records and is the world’s largest database of P&C claims information used for claims processing and fraud investigations. Insurers and other participants submit more than 187,917 new claims a day on average across all U.S. P&C insurance industry categories. The benefits of an industrywide claims database include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for information, enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious claims, and superior information for investigating fraudulent claims, suspicious individuals, and possible fraud rings. Our database also helps insurers fulfill their regulatory compliance reporting requirements at both the \nstate and federal levels for delinquent child-support liens and other required checks.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen a claim is submitted, our system searches our claims database and returns information about other claims filed by the same individuals or businesses (either as claimants or insureds) that helps our customers determine if fraud may be occurring. The system searches for matches in identifying information fields, such as name, address, Social Security number, vehicle identification number, driver’s license number, tax identification number, or other parties to the loss. Our system also includes advanced name and address searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the overall quality of the matches.\n\n\n \n\n\nInformation from match reports speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim, negotiation of a reduced award, or further investigation by the insurer or law enforcement. We also have a suite of advanced fraud analytics solutions: a solution that uses predictive models to accurately score claims based on fraud indicators; an injury claims solution that uses predictive analytics to detect medical provider fraud, waste, and abuse; and a network analytics solution that helps detect patterns indicative of organized fraud. A claims adjuster or investigation professional can use our comprehensive case management system to manage claim investigations.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe continually pursue new solutions that help our customers keep abreast of changing markets and technology. For example, we developed a digital media database that allows customers to view prior-loss images on claim matches so they can detect pre-existing damage on new claims. Our advanced digital media forensics can detect suspicious claim-related photos, and our customers can flag stolen and synthetic identities in the database to help subscribers deter that type of fraud. We also provide accurate person and vehicle coverage details at first notice of loss (FNOL), including verified registered owner information through DMV data, contact information for the individual, and brief claims history.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      8\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCasualty Solutions\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe offer a full suite of casualty/bodily injury solutions to serve the P&C industry, third-party administrators, and self-insured employers. Verisk casualty solutions focus on compliance (Medicare Secondary Payer and workers’ compensation state reporting); casualty claims decision support (severity detection and damage assessment); and workflow automation (automated medical record review and claims processing). Our compliance division offers Medicare Secondary Payer solutions and services to comply with the federal statute, including Section 111 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reporting, lien resolution/conditional payments, liabilities repayment, and ongoing protection of the Medicare Trust Fund via Medicare Set Aside (MSA) services. As the largest provider of Medicare compliance services in the industry, we play a critical role in assisting and protecting all stakeholders, including Medicare and its beneficiaries.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur comprehensive workers’ compensation state reporting helps customers meet the very complex compliance requirements for reporting to states and other government related agencies and entities through an automated process driving efficiency and productivity for the U.S. P&C insurance industry.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur casualty claims decision support and workflow automation offerings augment human capital in a claims organization to make accurate decisions while eliminating manual steps in the process. We have solutions that leverage AI and generative AI to automatically extract unstructured data from and summarize medical records for efficient review and analysis during claim processing and demand packages review to improve injury evaluations and settlement negotiations. We also offer tools that use predictive analytics to provide workers’ compensation severity scoring from first notice of loss through claim closure to help our customers accurately settle claims. For liability, our customers can use our solution to find comparative liability in personal auto, commercial auto, and general liability claims for injury evaluation, determining accident liability and identifying subrogation opportunities.\n\n\n \n\n\nInternational Claims Solutions \n\n\n \n\n\nWe continue to expand our claim product offerings to international markets through internal innovations and acquisitions in both the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. Our solutions are centered around personal injury and motor franchises covering Germany, the Nordics, and the United Kingdom with complementary offerings to the property claims sector in the United Kingdom. Our solutions aim to enable greater certainty, lower indemnity, more automation, and quicker speed to settlement for our personal lines insurance customers. Where appropriate, we look to leverage our growing data assets to introduce claim analytics and anti-fraud solutions in these markets.\n\n\n \n\n\nEnergy and Specialized Markets Segment\n\n\n \n\n\nUp until the sale of our Energy business on February 1, 2023, we were a leading provider of data analytics across the natural resources value chain including the global energy, chemicals, metals and mining, and power and renewables sectors. We delivered analysis and advice on assets, companies, governments, and markets based on proprietary near real time data as well as historic information. This enabled us to offer a comprehensive and integrated analysis of relevant commodities to our customers. We provided research and consulting services focusing on supporting customer capital allocation decisions, asset valuation and benchmarking, commodity markets, and corporate analysis. We offered consultancy in the areas of business environment, business improvement, business strategies, commercial advisory, and transaction support.\n\n\n \n\n\nBefore the sale of our specialized markets on March 11, 2022, we offered a comprehensive suite of data and information services that enable improved compliance with global environmental health and safety (\"EH&S\") requirements related to the safe manufacturing, distribution, transportation, usage, and disposal of chemicals and products. From the supply chain or solutions life cycle, we delivered a program specific to the EH&S compliance information and management needs of our customers. Our full-solutions life cycle and cross-supply chain approach provided a single, integrated solution for managing customers' EH&S capabilities, which resulted in improved processes and reduced cost, risk, and liability.\n\n\n \n\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\n \n\n\nBefore\n \nthe sale of Financials Services Segment on April 8, 2022, we maintained the largest bank account consortia to provide competitive benchmarking, decisioning algorithms, business intelligence, and customized analytic services to financial institutions, payment networks and processors, alternative lenders, regulators, and merchants enabling better strategy, marketing, and risk decisions. We delivered unique solutions and services to an expanding customer base that valued the comprehensiveness of our data and solutions as well as our full wallet-spend view of a consumer. Complementing this, we leveraged our partnerships with processors and credit bureaus not only to augment the richness of our data but also to provide expanded solutions across the broad span of consumer banking and retail solutions.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      9\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Customers\n\n\n \n\n\nThe customers for the lines of P&C services we offer include the top 100 P&C insurance providers in the U\n.S., 18 of the top 25 global reinsurance companies, as well as domestic InsurTech companies and insurers in international markets. A substantial majority of P&C insurance providers in the U.S. use our statistical agent services to report to regulators, and the majority of insurers and reinsurers in the U.S. use our actuarial services and industry-standard insurance programs. In addition, certain agencies of the federal government as well as county and state governmental agencies and organizations use our solutions to help satisfy government needs for risk assessment and emergency response information. Within Extreme Events, we serve reinsurers, insurers, brokers, governments, and corporates helping them identify, quantify and plan for the financial consequences of catastrophes. For life and annuity insurers, we offer digital solutions including electronic applications and policy administration systems to enable automated/accelerated triage, underwriting, fraud detection, and modeling. Our claims database serves thousands of customers, representing approximately 90% of the P&C insurance industry by premium volume, approximately 500\n self-insurers, approximately 450 third party administrators, several state fraud bureaus, and many law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation and prosecution of insurance fraud. We estimate that more than 80% of insurance repair contractors and service providers in the U.S. and Canada with computerized estimating systems use our building and repair cost estimation pricing data.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Competitors\n\n\n \n\n\nThe breadth of markets we serve exposes us to a broad range of competitors as described below. Businesses that we acquire may introduce us to additional competitors.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe operate primarily in the U.S. P&C insurance industry. We have a number of competitors in specific lines or services. We encounter competition from a number of sources, including insurers that develop internal technology and actuarial methods for proprietary insurance programs. Competitors also include other statistical agents and other advisory organizations, that provide underwriting rules, prospective loss costs, and coverage language. Competitors for our property-specific rating and underwriting information are primarily regional providers of commercial property inspections and surveys as well as emerging providers in the InsurTech space. We also compete with a variety of organizations that offer consulting services, primarily specialty technology and consulting firms. In addition, a customer may use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm for these services. Our underwriting solutions compete with a variety of companies in the marketplace. Our competitors include information technology product and services vendors; management and strategy consulting firms; and smaller specialized information technology and analytical services firms. Finally, in the life insurance sector, our solutions compete against numerous independent vendors, as well as the in-house technology departments of Life Insurers. In the P&C insurance claims and catastrophe modeling markets, certain products are offered by a number of companies in the areas of catastrophe modeling, repair cost estimating, claims investigative reports, claims fraud analytics, and injury claims analytics. We believe that our P&C insurance industry expertise, and our ability to offer multiple applications, services, and integrated solutions to individual customers are competitive strengths.\n\n\n \n\n\nDevelopment of New Solutions\n\n\n \n\n\nWe take a market-focused team approach to developing our solutions. Our operating units are responsible for developing, reviewing, and enhancing our various solutions and services. Our data management and production team designs and manages our processes and systems for market data procurement, proprietary data production, and quality control. Our teams support our efforts to create new information and solutions from available data and explore new methods of collecting data. We are focused on understanding and documenting business unit and corporate data assets and data issues, sharing and combining data assets across the enterprise, creating an enterprise data strategy, facilitating research and product development, and promoting cross-enterprise communication.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur software development teams build the technology used in many of our solutions. As part of our product development process, we continually solicit feedback from our customers on the value of our solutions and services and the market’s needs. We have established an extensive system of customer advisory panels that meet regularly throughout the year to help us respond effectively to the needs of our markets. In addition, we use frequent sales calls, executive visits, user group meetings, and other industry forums to gather information to align our product development efforts with the needs of the market. We also use a variety of market research techniques to enhance our understanding of our customers and the markets in which they operate.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe add to our offerings through an active acquisition program. Since 2022, we have a\ncquired 8 businesses, w\nhich have allowed us to enter new markets, offer new solutions, and enhance the value of existing services with additional proprietary sources of data.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen we find it advantageous, we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings. This approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      10\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClient Strategy, Sales, and Support\n\n\n \n\n\nOur overall client strategy is driven by our extensive industry expertise and our unique position within the insurance ecosystem. We endeavor to be the leading strategic data, analytics, and technology partner to the global insurance industry by delivering value to our clients through knowledge, expertise, and scale, and we focus on elevating the strategic dialogue with our clients. Our company primarily engages with clients through direct interaction, leveraging a structured, multi-tiered sales approach. This approach includes Managing Directors, Account Executives, Account Managers, Subject Matter Experts, Technical Consultants, and Sales Client Support specialists. Within our organization, we have dedicated sales teams that focus on specific solutions and services. These specialized Account Executives are responsible for selling highly technical solution sets to targeted markets, working in close coordination with broader account management teams to ensure a holistic approach to customer engagement.\n\n\n \n\n\nAccount Executives play a key role in both sales and customer service activities. They provide direct support to assigned customers, engaging frequently to ensure a positive experience with our services. While Account Executives primarily focus on identifying new sales opportunities, they collaborate closely with various teams to align our solutions with customer needs. We believe our deep solutions knowledge, ability to build trusted relationships, and local presence set us apart from the competition. Subject Matter Experts partner with Account Executives on specific opportunities related to their assigned solutions and market segments. Account Executives manage the overall sales process, while Subject Matter Experts manage the detailed integration and functional discussions to ensure successful outcomes and customer satisfaction. Both Account Executives and Subject Matter Experts are responsible for identifying new sales opportunities as well as managing renewals of existing business. A team-based approach, supported by a unified customer relationship management system, ensures effective coordination across all groups.\n\n\n \n\n\nTo optimize account management for our largest customers, we segment our client base into three distinct tiers. Tier One consists of our most significant customers. To ensure strategic and executive-level engagement with these Tier One clients, a Managing Director within the Client Strategy organization is responsible for the overall and executive-level relationship between the client and all of Verisk, fostering alignment across our solutions and services. Tier Two clients encompass both large and middle-market customer groups. Tier Three consists of smaller, specialized companies that may focus on a single line of business, serve specific regions, or be recent entrants to the market. Within the Tier One and Tier Two segments, our US and global sales teams are organized by the following disciplines: personal lines underwriting and pricing, commercial lines underwriting and pricing, claims, catastrophe modeling and exposure management, and specialty. For Tier Three clients, a generalist Account Executive is assigned within each business unit, taking on overall account management responsibilities. Our tiered approach has proven to be an effective sales model for building strong customer relationships. Additionally, our senior leadership team, including the Senior Operating Committee, regularly engages with senior management at our client organizations to ensure strategic alignment, and to foster opportunities for mutual partnership and innovation.\n\n\n \n\n\nSources of Our Data\n\n\n \n\n\nThe data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions is sourced through seven different kinds of data arrangements. First, we gather data from our customers within agreements that also permit our customers to use the solutions created from their data. Those agreements remain in effect unless the data contributor chooses to opt out. It is very rare that contributors elect not to continue providing us data. Second, we have agreements with data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of their data and provide their required levels of privacy, protection of data, and where necessary, de-identification of data. The agreements represent no cost to us, generally feature a specified period of time for the data contributions, and require renewal. Third, we “mine” data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions; as an example, we use the claims settlement data generated inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost factors used in our models. Again, those arrangements represent no cost to us, and we obtain the consent of our customers to make use of their data in this way. Fourth, we source data generally at no cost from public sources, including federal, state, and local governments. Fifth, we gather data about the physical characteristics of commercial properties through the direct observation of our field staff members, who also perform property surveys at the request of, and facilitated by, property insurers. Sixth, we collect data, or license or purchase from third parties, on geographic and spatially referenced information relating to residential and commercial structures by using the latest remote sensing and machine learning technologies. Lastly, we purchase data from data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased, including county tax assessor records, descriptions of hazards such as flood plains, and professional licenses. We are the owners of the derivative solutions we create using the data we collect.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      11\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInformation Technology\n\n\n \n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n \n\n\nOur information technology systems and the more recent adoption of cloud computing are fundamental to our success. They are used for the storage, processing, access, and delivery of the data that forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of the solutions we provide to our customers. We generally own, or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business, all the customer-facing applications that are material to our operations. We support and implement a mix of technologies and focus on implementing the most efficient technology for any given business requirement or task.\n\n\n \n\n\nData Centers\n\n\n \n\n\nIn 2023, with our migration to cloud computing, we closed our Lehi, Utah Data Center, and in 2024, we closed our Somerset, New Jersey facility.  We will continue to maintain other datacenters dedicated to other businesses we acquired recently.\n\n\n \n\n\nDisaster Recovery\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are committed to a framework for business continuity management and carry out annual reviews of the state of preparedness of each business unit. As we migrate our applications to the public cloud, we also evaluate the level of redundancy required for each application. We leverage native cloud capabilities with regards to availability and use both zones and regions in public cloud based on availability requirements. Business continuity planning is in place for all of our critical business processes to provide for the prompt and effective continuation of critical services in the event of a business disruption. Our business continuity program adheres to ISO 22301:2019, which is an international standard for business continuity. All business impact analysis and business continuity plans are reviewed and updated, at a minimum, annually or when significant business changes occur.\n\n\n \n\n\nSecurity\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have adopted a wide range of measures to secure our IT infrastructure and data. Security measures generally cover the following key areas: security policies and governance committees, physical security, logical security of the perimeter, network security such as firewalls, logical access to applications and operating systems, deployment of endpoint anti-malware software, email security, and appropriate procedures relating to removable media such as laptops. Laptops are encrypted, and media leaving our premises and sent to third-party storage facilities are also encrypted. Our commitment to security has earned ISO 27001:2013 Certification for our core data centers, which is an international standard for best practices associated with our Information Security Management System. See also \"Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\"\n\n\n \n\n\nIntellectual Property\n\n\n \n\n\nWe own a significant number of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and patents. Specifically, our policy language, insurance manuals, software, and databases are protected by both registered and common law copyrights. and the licensing of those materials to our customers for their use represents a large portion of our revenue. We also own in excess of 600 trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries, including the names of our solutions and services and our logos and tag lines, many of which are registered. We believe many of our trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos to be of material importance to our business, as they assist our customers in identifying our solutions and services and the quality that stands behind them. We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (for example, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and patent) and contractual safeguards in a comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to protect it wherever it is used.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe also own several patents and have several pending patent applications in the U.S. that complement our solutions. We believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our success, and we will continue to seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we have expended substantial research and development capital and that are material to our business.\n\n\n \n\n\nTo maintain control of our intellectual property, we enter into contractual agreements with our customers, granting each customer permission to use our solutions and services, including our software and databases. This helps maintain the integrity of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the embedded information and technology contained in our solutions. As a general practice, employees, contractors, and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information, and technology.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      12\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman Capital\n\n\n \n\n\nOur global workforce is united by our mission to serve, add value, and innovate for customers. We continue to invest in our people worldwide by encouraging all employees to reach their full potential through a focus on learning, providing competitive compensation and benefits, and a culture anchored on our purpose driven values of results, learning, and caring.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs a knowledge-based business, we carefully integrate the skills and talents of approximately 7,800 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2024. Most of our highly credentialed team holds advanced degrees and professional certifications specializing in actuarial science, chemistry and physics, commercial banking, finance, commodity analytics, data science and artificial intelligence, economics, engineering, GIS mapping, meteorology, natural resources, predictive analytics, supply chain, and other fields. \n\n\n \n\n\nApproximately 59% of our employees are based in the United States, 12% in the United Kingdom, 9% in India, with the remainder serving in 20 other countries across the globe. \n\n\n \n\n\nVery few of our employees are represented by unions or subject to collective bargaining agreements, and only a small number of employees in Germany are represented by a works council. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements. \n\n\n \n\n\nWe support and work to inspire our people with a collaborative and engaging culture, and career development and learning opportunities at all levels, competitive compensation and benefits, an ongoing focus on well-being, and responsive leadership. Starting in 2021, we introduced a common global wellbeing day across the enterprise to recognize the importance of the total wellbeing of our workforce.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn 2024, we continued to prioritize career development across the company by utilizing an employee-centric strategy based on feedback from employees and managers.  We further developed a Career Framework, to provide clarity on jobs across all of our businesses and functions. This enables employees to envision their next career steps and explore career pathways and development opportunities within the company.  By actively listening to both employees and managers, we identified key enhancements including skills and proficiency levels aligned to each of our job functions (over 2,000 skill/job combinations), and new tools and training for employees to navigate. Our 2024 Career Framework education sessions were attended by 3,306\n \ncolleagues, providing them insights into how to navigate their careers at Verisk.\n\n\n \n\n\nEach quarter, employees and managers participate in quarterly check-ins and are prompted to review and discuss goals, progress, and ways to grow and develop. We supported managers by offering targeted training around having productive career conversations. In 2024, we saw 854 people leaders attend our Career Conversations education sessions. Also, during each of our quarterly check-ins, we asked employees to answer a question to track progress against a leadership goal assigned to all people managers.  By tracking employee answers, we know over 76% of employees discussed goals by the end of Q1, over 93% of employees reported receiving feedback in Q2, and 75% reported having career conversations with their managers in Q3. This is a strong measure of employee perceptions of managers due to the high level of participation in quarterly reviews (90%+ of employees participate in quarterly reviews). \n\n\n \n\n\nOur leadership development programs are targeted at rising professionals, first-time managers, and new for 2024, experienced leaders. Our new Experienced Leader Program ran a pilot with 35 global leaders and had a successful fall 2024 cohort with 87 global leaders participating. In 2024, we saw a large increase in participation for our rising professionals leadership program, Accelerate Your Leadership, which saw 455 colleagues enroll for the program this year.  This represented a 185% increase in participation comparative to 2023. The 2024 Leadership Meeting brought together 114 senior leaders across Verisk’s businesses. The event fostered understanding of business strategy, visibility, and alignment on 2024 key priorities, and created momentum and engagement for the future. In 2024, our high-potential development program gave 52 “rising stars” access to Verisk’s senior leaders and Board of Directors, opportunities to network across business lines, and access to an executive coaching experience.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition, and more broadly, our mentoring program provided one-on-one learning and growth opportunities to a record 464 participants, more than double the number in 2023. 2,400\n \nattendees also joined one of our monthly “Learning Breaks” on topics that included leadership, motivation, feedback, creativity, and learning. This represented a total attendance per month increase of 25% over 2023.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe offer competitive salaries, short and long-term incentives, and the opportunity for advancement. In addition, our Benefits program includes paid time off (“PTO”), flextime and telecommuting options, and a 401(k) program with a 100% company cash match (up to 6%). We also offer health insurance plans, no-cost life insurance equivalent to annual salary (with the option to purchase more), a discounted stock purchase program, a variety of physical, mental, and financial well-being offerings and resources. Terms vary by business unit and country.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      13\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn 2024, over 1,000 Verisk employees across 23 locations and 7 countries registered volunteer hours during Verisk Volunteer Week. Efforts included a Rise Against Hunger event with over 85,000 meals packed, donation drives, and local community cleanup activities. \n\n\n \n\n\nThe health and safety of our people working around the globe is a top priority, and our facilities worldwide follow rigorous, internally and externally audited, occupational health and safety policies. We also recognize that protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees is crucial.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe majority of our people worked remotely in 2021 but moved to a hybrid work policy in 2022 and 2023 with at least 2 days in the office. Senior leaders moved to 3 days in the office in 2023. We saw increased collaboration and engagement as a result of these moves.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur employee engagement score for 2024 is 78%, remaining steady since 2023. Verisk continues to be recognized for our outstanding workplace culture by Great Place to Work® in the U.S., receiving certification for the ninth consecutive year. In 2024, Verisk was certified for the fifth time in the United Kingdom, Spain, and India and was certified for the third time in Poland. Employees feel Verisk meets the benchmark for innovation, inclusivity, company values, and leaders’ effectiveness.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are also earning recognition from several Best Workplaces™ lists including Fortune’s Best Workplaces in New York™, UK's Best Workplaces™, UK’s Best Workplaces for Wellbeing™, UK’s Best Workplaces for Development™, UK’s Best Workplaces in Tech™, Spain’s Best Workplaces™, Best Workplaces in Málaga™, Poland’s Best Workplaces™, and India’s Great Mid-size Workplaces™. The Great Place to Work Institute is a global authority on high-trust, high-performance workplaces. To achieve certification, Verisk employees are surveyed on the extent to which they reported a consistently great workplace experience. To create an outstanding employee experience, leaders understand and act on their results and insights, and continuously communicate with employees through town halls and local engagement events.\n\n\n \n\n\nRegulation\n\n\n \n\n\nBecause our business involves the distribution of certain personal, public, and nonpublic data to businesses and governmental entities that make eligibility, service, and marketing decisions based on such data, certain of our solutions and services are subject to regulation under federal, state, and local laws in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in foreign countries. Examples of such regulation include the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use of consumer credit report information; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the use of nonpublic personal financial information held by financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions; the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the public disclosure, use, or resale by any state’s department of motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that was obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record, except for a “permissible purpose”; and various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations.\n\n\n \n\n\nThose laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal information and provide consumers certain rights to know the manner in which their personal information is being used, to challenge the accuracy of such information, and/or to prevent the use and disclosure of such information. In certain instances, the laws also impose requirements for safeguarding personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. Certain state laws impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches in certain circumstances.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are also licensed as a rating, rate service, advisory, or statistical organization under state insurance codes in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. As such an advisory organization, we provide statistical, actuarial, policy language development, and related solutions and services to P&C insurers, including advisory prospective loss costs, other prospective cost information, manual rules, and policy language. We also serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state insurance regulators to collect policy writing and loss statistics of individual insurers and compile that information into reports used by the regulators.\n\n\n \n\n\nMany of our solutions, services, and operations as well as insurers' use of our services are subject to state rather than federal regulation by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. As a result, many of our operations and solutions are subject to review and/or approval by state regulators. Further, our operations involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators; and our operations and solutions are subject to state antitrust and trade practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes, which are typically enforced by state attorneys general and/or insurance regulators.\n\n\n \n\n\nAvailable Information\n\n\n \n\n\nWe maintain an Investor Relations website on the Internet at investor.verisk.com.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those listed under “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” \n \nNew risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible to predict these events or how they may affect us. We have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof, except as required by applicable federal securities law. This discussion includes a comparison of our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, financing and financing capacity and cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022\n.\n\n\n    \n\n\nWe are a leading data analytics provider serving clients in the insurance markets. Using advanced technologies to collect and analyze billions of records, we draw on unique data assets and deep domain expertise to provide innovations that may be integrated into client workflows. We offer predictive analytics and decision support solutions to clients in rating, underwriting, claims, catastrophe and weather risk, global risk analytics, and many other fields. In the U.S., and around the world, we help clients protect people, property, and financial assets. Refer to \nItem 1\n. Business for further discussion.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur clients use our solutions to make better decisions about risk and opportunities with greater efficiency and discipline. We refer to these products and services as “solutions” due to the integration among our services and the flexibility that enables our clients to purchase components or the comprehensive package. These solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models, or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions. We believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our clients’ revenues and help them better manage their costs.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      28\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n \n\n\nKey Performance Metrics\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenue growth\n. We use year-over-year revenue growth as a key performance metric. We assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers, and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.\n\n\n \n\n\nEBITDA.\n We use year-over-year EBITDA growth as a key performance metric. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets. We calculate EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. The respective nearest applicable GAAP financial measures are net income and net income margin. Although EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, lenders, and others in their evaluation of companies; EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of our operating income, net income, or cash flow from operating activities reported under GAAP. Management uses EBITDA and EBITDA margin in conjunction with traditional GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment company performance. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparisons. Some of these limitations involved in the use of EBITDA are: \n\n\n \n\n\n• EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.\n\n\n \n\n\n• EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs.\n\n\n \n\n\n• Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\n\n\n \n\n\n• Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\n\n \n\n\nEBITDA growth\n. We use EBITDA growth as a measure of our ability to balance the size of revenue growth with cost management and investing for future growth. EBITDA growth allows for greater transparency regarding our operating performance and facilitate period-to-period comparison.\n\n\n \n\n\nEBITDA margin.\n We use EBITDA margin as a performance measure to assess segment performance and scalability of our business. We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      29\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\nWe earn revenues through agreements for hosted subscriptions, advisory/consulting services, and for transactional solutions, recurring and non-recurring. Subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one to five years and automatically renewed each year. As a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition \nof revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments. Examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database, or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period. In general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business. Approximately 81% and 80% of the revenues in our Insurance segment for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, respectively, were derived from hosted subscriptions through agreements for our solutions, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe also provide advisory/consulting services, which help our customers get more value out of our analytics and their subscriptions. In addition, certain of our solutions are paid for by our customers on a transactional basis, recurring and non-recurring. For example, we have solutions that allow our customers to access property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a P&C insurance or a workers' compensation claim with information in our databases, or use our repair cost estimation solutions on a case-by-case basis. For the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, approximately 19% and 20% of our consolidated revenues, respectively, were derived from providing transactional and advisory/consulting solutions, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nPrincipal Operating Costs and Expenses\n\n\n \n\n\nPersonnel expenses are a major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel expenses, which represented approximately 56% and 57% of our total operating expenses (excluding gains/losses related to dispositions) for each of the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs\n, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe assign personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee. We categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, salespeople, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses. A significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhile we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues. Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses. However, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions and new businesses, which may offset margin expansion.\n\n\n \n\n\nCost of Revenues.\n Our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses. Cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions, and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions. Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.\n\n\n \n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense.\n Our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs. A portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance, and communications are allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee. Our selling, general and administrative expenses exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      30\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrends Affecting Our Business\n\n\n \n\n\nA significant change in the profitability of P&C insurers could affect the demand for our solutions. The keys to profitability for insurers include premium growth, increasing investment income, and disciplined and accurate underwriting of risks. The growth of direct written premiums for P&C insurers has exhibited cyclical patterns, with total industry premium growth declining from a peak of 14.8% in 2002 to a trough of (3.1)% in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 5.1% in 2019. In 2020, industry premium growth declined to 2.3% due to the impact of the pandemic. Direct premium growth accelerated to 9.5% in 2021, 9.7% in 2022, and further increased to 10.4% in 2023, indicating a continued recovery from the pandemic. Based on the most recent results available, written premiums continued to grow in 2024 at a comparable level.\n\n\n \n\n\nWith inflation remaining above pre-pandemic levels throughout 2024 and the CPI consistently exceeding the 2% target, reaching 2.9% in December, the Federal Reserve took timely action to adjust its monetary policy and reduce interest rates.  The federal funds rate was reduced from a target range of 5.25-5.5% early in 2024 to a target range of 4.25-4.5% range by the end of December. Reductions in interest rates can lead to increased consumer spending and investment, resulting in higher demand for insurance products as individuals and businesses seek to protect their assets. In such cases, comprehensive data analysis and risk assessment support can help insurers significantly improve their operations. It enables more accurate calculations and provides a broad, systemic view of the market.\n\n\n \n\n\nDespite some progress made towards actuarially sound pricing, carriers are still working to improve loss ratios and profitability in the face of heightened inflation. Until premium pricing adjustments are fully implemented, and profitability improves, some carriers are not yet spending as much as they have in the past to drive new policy volume, which could have a short-term impact on demand and volume for our Marketing Solutions offerings and auto underwriting solutions.\n\n\n \n\n\nInsurers’ annualized yield on investments (not attributable to cash transfers from outside the P&C industry) was 2.5% as of the first nine months of 2024, down from the 3.2% yield at year-end 2023 despite still moderately high interest rates (compared to the pre-pandemic period) in 2024. These recent investment results are lower than the historical 15-year average of 3.3%, showing that yields on investments, a major component of insurers’ balance sheets, have yet to follow the trend in interest rates.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe trend of high catastrophe losses for insurers that began in 2020 continued through 2024. Insurance losses in these five latest years were more than 1.75 times the losses in the prior five years (2015-2019). Both 2023 and 2024 reflected a record high for the number of catastrophes recorded in a single year. But while those 2023 catastrophes translated into the lowest financial losses in any year since the pandemic, 2024, however, brought much greater catastrophic impacts that resulted in significant losses. The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season was the second most expensive on record, surpassed only by the 2017 season. Although Hurricane Helene was the deadliest, causing massive flooding in North Carolina and significant property damage and loss of life, most of the damage was caused by Hurricane Milton, one of the strongest tropical cyclones to hit the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Hurricane Beryl, the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, caused widespread devastation as it crossed the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. And 2025 is off to an active start with the latest breakout of wildfires in California with insured industry losses to property that our Extreme Event Solutions group has estimated could be as much as $35.0 billion.\n\n\n \n\n\nThese trends in catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses (such as from weather, climate, casualty, terrorism, pandemics, and tsunamis) can influence our customers’ profitability, and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks. Any increase or decrease in frequency or severity of these events over time could lead to an increased or decreased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions. Likewise, any structural changes in the reinsurance and related brokerage industry from alternative capital or newer technologies could affect demand for our products. A portion of our revenue is also related to the number of claims processed due to losses, which can be impacted by seasonal storm or wildfire activity. The need by our customers to fight insurance fraud - both in claims and at policy inception - could also lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      31\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDescription of Acquisitions\n\n\n \n\n\nWe acquired 8 businesses since January 1, 2022. These acquisitions affect the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between periods. See a description of our \n2024\n acquisition below and \nNote 10\n. Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussions.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn  January 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of 100 percent of Rocket Enterprise Solutions GmbH (\"Rocket\") for a net cash purchase price of $10.1 million, of which $2.2 million represents a deferred payment and $0.3 million represents a holdback payment. The majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill as we did not incur any material liabilities. Rocket’s strong property claims and underwriting technology has been widely adopted by many of the largest insurers and service providers across Germany and Austria. Rocket has become a part of our claims category. The acquisition, which follows a strategic investment by Verisk in Rocket in 2022, will further Verisk's expansion in Europe and the Company’s goal of helping insurers and claims service providers leverage more holistic data and technology tools to enhance the claims experience.\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription of Dispositions\n\n\n \n\n\nIn December 2024, we sold Atmospheric and Environmental Research (\"AER\") for $7.1 million. The sale resulted in a loss of $12.1 million that was included within \"Other operating (loss) income\" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription of Discontinued Operations\n\n\n \n\n\nSee a description of our 2023 disposition below and within \nNote 11\n. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussions.\n\n\n \n\n\nOn February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our Energy business to Planet Jersey Buyer Ltd, an entity that was formed on behalf of, and is controlled by, The Veritas Capital Fund VIII, L.P. and its affiliated funds and entities (“Veritas Capital”), for a net cash sale price of $3,066.4 million paid at closing (reflecting a base purchase price of $3,100.0 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for, among other things, the cash, working capital, and indebtedness of the companies as of the closing) and up to $200.0 million of additional contingent cash consideration based on Veritas Capital’s future return on its investment paid through a Class C Partnership interest.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Energy business, which was part of our Energy and Specialized Markets segment, was classified as discontinued operations per ASC 205-20 as we determined, qualitatively and quantitatively, that this transaction represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Additionally, all assets and liabilities of the Energy business were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In connection with the held for sale classification, we recognized an impairment of $303.7 million on the remeasurement of the disposal group held for sale, which has been included in discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations. Upon classification of the Energy business as held for sale, its cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment within shareholders’ equity was included with its carrying value, which primarily resulted in the impairment. When we closed on and completed the sale of our Energy business on February 1, 2023, we recognized a loss of $128.4 million. As a result of closing adjustments in the second and fourth quarter of 2023, we incurred an additional net loss of $2.7 million.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nConsolidated Results of Continuing Operations\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenues were \n$2,881.7\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$2,681.4\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, an increase of \n$200.3\n million or \n7.5%\n.

Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for an increase of $6.1 million in cost of revenues, which was primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. The remaining cost of revenues increase of $18.5 million or 2.1% was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of\n $8.3\n \nmillion, information technology expense of $6.9\n \nmillion, data costs of $\n6.3\n million, bad debt expense of $\n5.6\n million, and fees and membership costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in rent expense of $3.3 million, a decrease of $2.2 million on the disposal of fixed assets, $1.5 million gain primarily related to our Jersey City lease modification, decreases in office expense of $\n0.8\n million, insurance expense of $0.7 million, professional consulting fees of $0.5 million, and other operating costs of $0.3 million.\n\n\n \n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n\n \n\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SGA\") w\nere \n$408.7\n m\nillion for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$391.8\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, an increase of \n$16.9\n million or \n4.3%\n. Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for an increase of $22.7 million in SGA. This increase was primarily due to an acquisition-related earn-out credit of $20.0 million in the prior year that did not recur in the current period. The offsetting decrease of $\n5.8\n million or \n1.4\n% was primarily due to a \nprior year litigation reserve expense of $38.2 million related to our former Financial Services segment, decreases in fees and membership costs of $3.2 million, bad debt expense of $1.1 million, and other operating costs of $1.2 million, partially offset by an \nincrease in professional consulting fees of $15.8 million\n, salaries and employee benefits of $12.3 million, a $6.5 million loss on the disposal of assets primarily due to a write-off of leasehold improvements related to our lease modification, increases in insurance expense of $2.0 million, and information technology expense of $1.3 million.\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation and Amortization of Fixed Assets\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets was \n$233.6\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$206.8\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, an increase of \n$26.8\n million or \n13.0%\n. The increase was primarily due to the timing of certain large internally developed software projects that were completed and placed into service in the prior year, partially offset by a decrease due to our recent disposition of $0.3 million.\n\n\n \n\n\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n\n\n \n\n\nAmortization of intangible assets was \n$72.3\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$74.6\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, a decrease of \n$2.3\n million or \n3.1%\n. The decrease was primarily due to intangible assets that were fully amortized, partially offset by an increase due to our recent acquisition of $0.3 million.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Other operating loss (income)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther operating loss (income) was \n$12.1\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$0.0\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n. The loss in the current year was driven by the sale of AER.

The increase was primarily driven by net gains associated with the settlement of retained interests related to the prior sales of our healthcare business in 2016 and our specialized markets business in 2022, partially offset by the impact of foreign currencies.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      33\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest Expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest expense, net was \n$124.6\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$115.5\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, an increase of \n$9.1\n million or \n7.9%\n. The increase in interest expense was primarily related to the issuance of our 2034 Senior Notes, offset by the cash tender that was completed on June 7, 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\nThe provision for income taxes was \n$277.9\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$258.8\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n. The effective tax rate was \n22.6\n% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n25.2\n% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to tax charges incurred in structuring the sale of our Energy business in the prior year, as well as additional tax benefits recorded for capital losses that we were able to recognize due to capital gains arising from the settlement of our investments in non-public companies in the current year.\n\n\n \n\n\nNet Income Margin\n\n\n \n\n\nThe net income margin for our consolidated results was 33.2% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to 22.9% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n. The increase in net income margin was primarily driven by net gains associated with the settlement of retained interests related to the prior sales of our healthcare business in 2016 and our specialized markets business in 2022, the early extinguishment of debt, discussed above, and a prior year litigation reserve expense related to our former Financial Services segment, partially offset by the loss recognized on the sale of AER. The net income margin for December 31, 2023 included a loss from discontinued operations of $154.0 million, which negatively impacted our net income margin by 5.7%.\n\n\n \n\n\nEBITDA Margin [1]\n\n\n \n\n\nEBITDA was $1,659.1 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to $1,424.1 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n. The EBITDA margin for our consolidated results was \n57.6\n% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to 53.1% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n. The increase was primarily driven by strong revenue growth and cost discipline, a prior year litigation reserve expense related to our former Financial Services segment, and net gains associated with the prior sales of our healthcare business in 2016 and our specialized markets business in 2022.\n\n\n \n\n\n[1] Note: Consolidated EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure, is calculated as a percentage of consolidated revenue.

This transaction did not qualify as discontinued operations per the guidance in ASC 205-20. The Energy business within the \"Energy and Specialized Markets\" segment was classified as discontinued operations per the guidance in ASC 205-20. Accordingly, all results of the Energy business have been removed from continuing operations and presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.

Our recent acquisitions (Morning Data within the underwriting category of our Insurance segment; and Mavera and Krug within the claims category of the Insurance segment) increased net revenues by $32.4 million. The remaining growth in revenues of $212.0 million or 8.7% is related to increased revenues within our Insurance segment. Refer to the Results of Operations by Segment within this section for more information regarding our revenues. Our Specialized Market business was sold in March 2022; and our Energy business, which qualified for discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2022, was subsequently sold in Februar\ny 2023.

Our recent acquisitions and dispositions accounted for a net decrease of $16.5 million in cost of revenues, which was primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. The cost of revenues increase of $68.4 million or 8.7% was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $51.0 million, rent expense of $6.6 million, bad debt expense of $3.8 million, travel expenses of $3.6 million, data costs of $1.8 million, and other operating costs of $3.9 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in information technology expenses of $2.1 million and professional consulting fees $0.2 million\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n\n \n\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SGA\") were $391.8 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to $381.5 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n, an increase of $10.3 million or 2.7%. Our recent acquisitions, primarily related to salaries and benefits of $24.5 million, contributed to the increase, offset by our recent dispositions and acquisition-related earn-out costs, which accounted for decreases of $34.1 million and $16.5 million, respectively. The remaining SGA increase of $36.4 million or 10.0% was primarily due to a litigation reserve expense of $38.2 million associated with an indemnification of an ongoing inquiry related to our former Financial Services segment, increases in travel expenses of $3.9 million, professional consulting fees (mostly related to ERP costs) of $3.4 million, information technology expenses of $0.6 million, and other operating costs of $0.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $10.6 million.\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation and Amortization of Fixed Assets\n\n\n \n\n\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $206.8 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to $164.2 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n, an increase of $42.6 million or 25.9%. The increase was primarily driven by $44.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense attributed to an increase in assets placed into service to support revenue growth and recent acquisitions of $0.2 million, partially offset by $2.2 million related to recent dispositions. The increase in assets placed into service in 2023 primarily resulted from the timing of certain large internally developed software projects that were completed and placed into service during the year.\n\n\n \n\n\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n\n\n \n\n\nAmortization of intangible assets w\nas $74.6 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to $74.4 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n, an increase of $0.2 million or 0.3%. The increase was primarily driven by recent acquisitions of $3.7 million, partially offset by our recent dispositions of $3.5 million.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      36\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Operating Income\n\n\n \n\n\nOther operating income was $0.0 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to $354.2 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n. The gain in the prior year was primarily driven by the sale of 3E and Financial Services segment recognized in the prior year.\n\n\n \n\n\nInvestment Income (Loss) and Others, Net\n\n\n \n\n\nInvestment income (loss) and others, net was\n a gain of $11.0 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to a loss of $5.3 million f\nor the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to impact of foreign currencies.\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest Expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\nInterest expense was $115.5 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to $138.8 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n, a decrease of $23.3 million or 16.8%. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the paydown in the current year of our outstanding borrowings on our Syndicated Revolving and Bilateral credit facilities, and an increase in interest income of $15.8 million, partially offset by interest expense related to the issuance of our 2033 Senior Notes.\n\n\n \n\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $258.8 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to $220.3 million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n. The effective tax rate was 25.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to tax rate benefits in 2022 related to the sale of 3E and a release of a United Kingdom valuation allowance associated with interest expense utilization. In addition, the tax rate for 2023 was higher than the prior year due to tax charges incurred in structuring the Energy sale in the first quarter and the unfavorable impact of the litigation reserve expense, described above, that is anticipated to be mostly non-deductible.\n\n\n \n\n\nNet Income Margin\n\n\n \n\n\nThe net income margin for our consolidated results was 22.9% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to 38.2% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022\n. The decrease in net income margin was primarily driven by the net gain from dispositions in the prior year, as well as the current year litigation reserve expense described above.\n\n\n \n\n\nEBITDA Margin [1]\n\n\n \n\n\nThe EBITDA margin for our consolidated\n results was 53.1% for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to 65.7% for\n the year ended December 31, 2022.

available-for-sale securities totaling $292.5 million and $303.9 million, respectively. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in higher credit quality financial institutions in order to limit the amount of credit exposure. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \nDecember 31, 2023\n, a vast majority of our domestic cash and cash equivalents is with TD Bank, N.A., and JPMorgan Chase N.A. Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year. Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year. We have historically generated significant cash flows from operations. As a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our Credit Facility, we expect that we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and to fuel our future growth plans.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered. When cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a liability (deferred revenues). This current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services. In most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows. Unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022\n were $223.9 million, $230.0 million, and $274.7 million, respectively. Expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal-use software and are capitalized in accordance with ASC 350-40, \nAccounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe have historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders. For the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022\n, we repurchased $1,005.0 million, $2,762.3 million, and $1,662.5 million, respectively, of our common stock. For the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022\n, we also paid dividends of $221.3 million, $196.8 million, and $195.2 million, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\nFinancing and Financing Capacity\n\n\n \n\n\nWe had total deb\nt, excluding finance lease obligations, unamortized discounts and premium, and debt issuance costs, of $3,050.0 million and $2,850.0 million at \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, respectively. The debt at \nDecember 31, 2024\n primarily consists of senior notes issued in 2024, 2023, 2020, 2019, and 2015. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually each year. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were recorded as \"Long-term debt\" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and will be amortized to \"Interest expense\" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within this Form 10-K over the life of the respective senior note. The indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions, and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey, or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person or entity. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding notes, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See \nNote 15\n. Debt for additional information on our financing activities.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have a $1,000 million Syndicated Credit Facility with Bank of America N.A., HSBC Bank USA, N.A., JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Citibank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., TD Bank, N.A., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, and the Northern Trust Company with a maturity date of April 5, 2028. Borrowing under the facility is payable at an interest rate of SOFR plus 100.0 to 162.5 basis points, depending on the public debt rating. The financial covenants require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio of less than 3.75 to 1.0\n.\n At our election, the maximum consolidated funded debt leverage ratio could be permitted to increase to 4.50 to 1.0 (no more than once) and to 4.25 to 1.0 (no more than once) in connection with the closing of a permitted acquisition. The Syndicated Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs and capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, and the Repurchase Program. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we were in compliance with all financial and other debt covenants under the Syndicated Credit Facility. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \nDecember 31, 2023\n, the available capacity under the Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility was $995.4 million, which takes into account outstanding letters of credit of $4.6 million. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      39\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCash Flow\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended December 31:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n2024\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n2023\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n2022\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n(in millions)\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,144.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,060.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,059.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(124.8\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,746.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n301.4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNet cash used in financing activities\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(1,028.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(3,786.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(1,330.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOperating Activities\n\n\n \n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was \n$1,144.0\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n compared to \n$1,060.7\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n, an increase of \n$83.3\n million, or \n7.9%\n. \nThe increase in operating cash flow was due to an increase in operating profit, offset by an increase in interest payments.\n\n\n \n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was \n$1,060.7\n million for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023\n compared to \n$1,059.0\n million for the year ended December 31, 2022\n, an increase of \n$1.7\n million, or \n0.2%\n. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflects an increase in the operating profit of our Insurance segment and lower tax payments in 2023, offset by the disposition of our Energy business in February 2023.

of excise tax of $25.2 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, $590.2 million from the proceeds of loan-term debt net of original issuance discount, and proceeds

The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefits, stock-based compensation, and income taxes. Actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      41\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\n\n \n\n\nStock-based compensation cost, including nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, performance share units tied to the achievement of certain market performance conditions, namely relative total shareholder return as compared to the S&P 500 index (\"TSR-based PSU's\"), and performance share units tied to the achievement of certain financial performance conditions, namely incremental return on invested capital (\"ROIC-based PSUs\"), is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of stock options is measured using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and expected dividend yield. The stock options have an exercise price equal to the adjusted closing price of our common stock on the grant date with a ten-year contractual term. The fair value of the restricted stock is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The restricted stock is not assignable or transferable until it becomes vested. The fair value of TSR-based PSUs is determined on the grant date using the Monte Carlo Simulation model and their ultimate achievement is based on relative total shareholder return as compared to the companies that compromise the S&P 500 index. The fair value of ROIC-based PSUs is determined on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date and their ultimate achievement is tied to incremental return on invested capital based on net operating profit. Each of the TSR-based PSUs and ROIC-based PSUs has a three-year performance period, subject to the recipients continued service. Each PSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock and the ultimate realization is based on our achievement of certain market and financial performance criteria and may range from 0% to 200% of the recipients target levels of 100% established on the grant date.\n\n\n \n\n\nOption grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period. PSUs are generally expensed ratably over the three-year vesting period. We follow the substantive vesting period approach which requires that stock-based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest. The forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.\n\n\n \n\n\nInternally Developed Software\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   We capitalize certain development costs incurred in connection with internally developed software. These capitalized costs primarily pertain to software hosted by us and accessed by customers. Costs during the initial development stages are expensed as they occur. Once an application reaches the development stage, both internal and external costs are capitalized if they are direct and incremental, until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization stops upon completion of all significant testing. Additionally, we capitalize costs associated with specific software upgrades and enhancements when the expenditures result in additional features and functionality. Once in service, internally developed software assets are assessed for recoverability and impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Any impairment, as identified, is calculated as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value, using acceptable valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as circumstances require.\n  \n\n\n \n\n\nGoodwill and Intangibles\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had goodwill of $1,726.6 million, which represents 40.5% of our total assets. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may decide to first perform a qualitative assessment, or “Step Zero” impairment test, to determine whether it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred. The qualitative assessment includes a review of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, internal cost factors, and our own overall financial and share price performance, among other factors. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of our reporting units exceeds their fair value, we perform a quantitative assessment and calculate the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. As of June 30, 2024, we completed our Step Zero impairment test at the reporting unit level and determined it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of our reporting units exceeded their fair values. We did not recognize any additional impairment charges related to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Subsequent to the test performed on June 30, 2024, we continued to monitor these reporting units for events that would trigger an interim impairment test; we did not identify any such events.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. The estimates used in valuing the intangible assets are determined with the assistance of third-party specialists, a discounted cash flow analysis and estimates made by management. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n\n \n\n\nPension and Postretirement\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit (credit) cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.\n  \n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n   In determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees. As part of our ev\n   \naluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans. Our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated AA or better at the measurement date. The outputs from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices. For our pension plans at \n\n   December 31, 2024\n   \n, we determined this rate to be 5.64% and 5.37% at \n\n   December 31, 2024 and 2023\n   \n, respectively. Our postretirement rate was 5.17% and 4.75% at \n\n   December 31, 2024 and 2023\n   \n, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      42\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment. Our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 60% debt securities and 40% equity securities. As of December 31, 2024, the pension plan assets were allocated 57.5% debt securities, 36.5% equity securities, 4.9% real estate and 1.1% other. The VEBA Plan target allocation is 100% debt securities. We have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan. The expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit (credits) costs. We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. We amortize, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. For our pension and postretirement plans, the total actuarial losses as of December 31, 2024 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $122.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively, and we expect to recognize a net periodic pension and postretirement expenses of $4.2 million and \n$0.3 million,\n respectively, in 2025 related to the amortization of actuarial losses.\n\n\n \n\n\nA one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nPension\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nPostretirement\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n1% Decrease\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n1% Increase\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n1% Decrease\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n1% Increase\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nBenefit (Credit) Cost\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nProjected Benefit Obligation\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nBenefit (Credit) Cost\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nProjected Benefit Obligation\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nBenefit (Credit) Cost\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nProjected Benefit Obligation\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nBenefit (Credit) Cost\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nProjected Benefit Obligation\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDiscount Rate\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.5\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n23.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(20.7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExpected Rate of Return on Assets\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(4.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\nIn projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with \nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of ASC 740\n, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe estimate unrecognized tax positions o\nf $0.9\n \nmillion that may be \nrecognized by December 31, 2025, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforw\nards of $53.0 \nmilli\non, which will expire at various dates from 2025 through 2044. Such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYears Ending\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n(in millions)\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025 - 2032\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n16.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2033 - 2037\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2038 - 2044\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTotal\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n53.0\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\n \n\n\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to \nNote 2(s)\n to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      43\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents",
