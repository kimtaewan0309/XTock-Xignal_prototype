  "item1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nNIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this \"Annual Report\"), the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"NIKE\" and the \"Company\" refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nOur principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\") and to wholesale accounts, which include a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in nearly all countries around the world. We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences. Nearly all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States, while equipment products are manufactured both in the United States and abroad.\nAll references to fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 are to NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal years ended May 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Any references to other fiscal years refer to a fiscal year ending on May 31 of that year.\nPRODUCTS \nWe offer our products under the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands. Our strategy is to achieve sustainable, profitable long-term growth by leading with sport, creating innovative, “must-have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail. We believe this approach will allow us to create products that better meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth opportunities.\nNIKE's athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products.\nWe also sell sports apparel, which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use, although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes, and demonstrates our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in \"collections\" of similar use. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos.\nWe sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.\nOur Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on sport performance and streetwear using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments.\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary brand, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\nIn addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities.\nWe also offer interactive consumer services and experiences, including sport focused events and activations; fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and wellness content; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience.\n2025 FORM 10-K   \n1\n \nTable of Contents\nSALES AND MARKETING\nWe experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors.\nBecause NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as well as changing design trends and consumer preferences, affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings and channels, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOUR MARKETS\nWe report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (\"EMEA\"); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (\"APLA\"), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands.\nConverse is also a reportable operating segment and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse direct to consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results.\nUNITED STATES MARKET\nFor fiscal 2025, NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 43% of total revenues, compared to 42% and 43% for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. We sell our products to wholesale accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other wholesale accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales. During fiscal 2025, our three largest United States customers accounted for approximately 25% of sales in the United States.\nOur NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell our products to consumers through various digital platforms, as well as through the following number of retail stores in the United States:\nU.S. RETAIL STORES\nNUMBER\nNIKE Brand factory stores\n213 \nNIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores)\n85 \nConverse stores (including factory stores)\n78 \nTOTAL\n376\n \nIn the United States, NIKE has eight significant distribution centers. Refer to Item 2. Properties for additional information.\n2025 FORM 10-K       \n2\nTable of Contents\nINTERNATIONAL MARKETS\nFor fiscal 2025, non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for approximately 57% of total revenues, compared to 58% and 57% for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. We sell our products to wholesale accounts, which include a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. We also ship products from 72 distribution centers outside of the United States. Refer to Item 2. Properties for additional information on distribution facilities outside of the United States. During fiscal 2025, NIKE's three largest customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 16% of total non-U.S. sales.\nIn addition to NIKE-owned and Converse-owned digital commerce platforms in over 40 countries, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer businesses operate the following number of retail stores outside the United States:\nNON-U.S. RETAIL STORES\nNUMBER\nNIKE Brand factory stores\n543 \nNIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores)\n61 \nConverse stores (including factory stores)\n54 \nTOTAL\n658\n \nSIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER\nNo customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net Revenues during fiscal 2025.\nPRODUCT RESEARCH, DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT\nWe believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, while decreasing our environmental impact.\nIn addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, physicians and other experts who consult with us and review certain designs, materials and concepts for product and manufacturing, design and other process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process.\nAs we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and experiences incorporating such technologies throughout our products and consumer applications. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories to respond to consumer preferences. The proliferation of Nike Air, Zoom, Free, Dri-FIT, Flyknit, FlyEase, ZoomX, Air Max, and React technologies, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.\nMANUFACTURING\nNearly all of our footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States by independent contract manufacturers (\"contract manufacturers\"), many of which operate multiple factories. We are also supplied, primarily indirectly, by a number of materials, or \"Tier 2\", suppliers who provide the principal materials used in footwear and apparel finished goods products. As of May 31, 2025, we had 184 strategic Tier 2 suppliers.\nAs of May 31, 2025, contract manufacturers operated 97 finished goods footwear factories located in 11 countries. For fiscal 2025, NIKE Brand footwear finished goods were manufactured by 15 contract manufacturers, many of which operate multiple factories. The largest single finished goods footwear factory accounted for approximately 11% of total fiscal 2025 NIKE Brand footwear production. For fiscal 2025, factories in Vietnam, Indonesia and China manufactured approximately 51%, 28% and 17% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. For fiscal 2025, four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 59% of NIKE Brand footwear production.\nAs of May 31, 2025, contract manufacturers operated 303 finished goods apparel factories located in 34 countries. For fiscal 2025, NIKE Brand apparel finished goods were manufactured by 67 contract manufacturers, many of which operate multiple factories. The largest single finished goods apparel factory accounted for approximately 8% of total fiscal 2025 NIKE Brand apparel production. For fiscal 2025, factories in Vietnam, China and Cambodia manufactured approximately 31%, 15% and 15% \n2025 FORM 10-K   \n3\n \nTable of Contents\nof total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively. For fiscal 2025, two apparel contract manufacturers accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 51% of NIKE Brand apparel production.\nNIKE's contract manufacturers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products from Tier 2 suppliers. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those contract manufacturers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. \nThe principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2025, Air Manufacturing Innovation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon, in Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, and St. Charles, Missouri, as well as contract manufacturers in China and Vietnam, were our suppliers of NIKE Air-Sole and other cushioning components used in footwear.\nThe principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns, trims and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. \nFrom time to time, certain materials used in the production of our products experience periods of high demand, shortages and price volatility. In fiscal 2025, contract manufacturers were able to source sufficient quantities of raw materials for use in our footwear and apparel products. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, for additional discussion of the impact of sourcing risks on our business.\nSince 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (\"Sojitz America\"), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed import-export financing services for us.\nINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE\nOur international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the implementation of, or potential changes in, foreign and domestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, trade agreement enforcement practices, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political tensions, instability, conflicts, nationalism and terrorism, and resulting sanctions and other measures imposed in response to such issues.\nIn 2025 and in other recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and, in nearly all cases, we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, will adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole, possibly materially.\nWe monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment and advocating for trade facilitation. NIKE also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs or penalties on imported goods or retaliatory measures by other countries, have negatively affected, and could in the future materially negatively affect, U.S. corporations, including NIKE, with business operations and/or consumer markets in those countries, which could also make it necessary for us to change the way we conduct business, either of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations. In addition, we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help support the development and implementation of legislation that (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers domestic economies and the important role they may play in the global economic community.\nWhere trade protection measures are implemented, we believe we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.\n2025 FORM 10-K       \n4\nTable of Contents\nOur international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. We source a significant portion of our products from, and have important consumer markets, outside of the United States. We have an ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us, our employees, agents, suppliers and other partners.\n \nRefer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information on risks relating to our international operations.\nCOMPETITION\nThe athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, Anta, ASICS, Deckers, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, New Balance, On, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.\nNIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are:\n•\nProduct attributes such as quality; innovation and development; performance and reliability; new product style, and design; as well as consumer price/value.\n•\nConsumer connection, engagement and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing, promotion and digital experiences; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, influencers, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics. \n•\nEffective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and on digital platforms.\nWe believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, including the risk factor titled \"Our products, services and experiences face intense competition.\"\nTRADEMARKS AND PATENTS\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We strategically pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect and enforce them against third-party theft and infringement.\nWe use trademarks on nearly all of our products and packaging, and in our marketing materials, and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 190 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we use in marketing our products. Throughout the world, we own common law rights in the trade dress of several distinctive shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademark registrations.\nWe have copyright protection in our designs, graphics, software applications, digital goods and other original works. When appropriate, we also obtain registered copyrights.\nWe file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility and design patents protecting components, technologies, materials, manufacturing techniques, features, functionality, and industrial designs used in and for the manufacture of various athletic, performance, and leisure footwear and apparel, including physical and digital versions thereof, athletic equipment, and digital devices, and related software applications. These patents expire at various times.\nWe believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing and is supported and protected by our intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, utility and design patents, copyrights, and trade secrets, among others. \nWe have followed a policy of applying for and registering intellectual property rights in the United States and select foreign countries on trademarks, inventions, innovations and designs that we deem protectable and valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect and enforce our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents and trade secrets against third-party infringement and misappropriation.\n2025 FORM 10-K   \n5\n \nTable of Contents\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt NIKE, we consider the strength and effective management of our workforce to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. We believe that it is important to attract, develop and retain an engaged workforce with diverse experiences, backgrounds and perspectives at all levels of our business and that such a workforce fosters creativity and accelerates innovation.\nCULTURE \nEach employee shapes NIKE's culture through behaviors and practices. This starts with our Maxims, which represent our core values and, along with our Code of Conduct, feature the fundamental behaviors that help anchor, inform and guide us and apply to all employees. Our mission is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world, which includes the belief that if you have a body, you are an athlete. We aim to do this by creating groundbreaking sport innovations, making our products more sustainably, building a creative global team with diverse experiences, backgrounds and perspectives, supporting the well-being of our employees and making a positive impact in communities where we live and work. Our mission is aligned with our deep commitment to maintaining an environment where all NIKE employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential, to connect to our brands and to shape our workplace culture. We believe providing for growth and retention of our employees is essential in fostering such a culture and are dedicated to providing access to training programs and career development opportunities, including trainings on NIKE's values, history and business, trainings on developing leadership skills at all levels, tools and resources for managers and qualified tuition reimbursement opportunities.\nWe are committed to having an inclusive and diverse team and culture, and accessible workplace. We achieve this through recruitment, development and retention of qualified talent with diverse experiences, backgrounds and perspectives through traditional channels, initiatives and partnerships, including those that serve colleges and universities. Additionally, we provide access to education so that all NIKE employees and leaders have the cultural knowledge and understanding to lead inclusively and build diverse and inclusive teams. We also have employee resource groups, collectively known as NikeUNITED, that promote NIKE cultural awareness and are open to all. \nIn empowering our employees to help shape our culture, we source employee feedback through a variety of survey tools: our annual Engagement Survey program, corporate pulse surveys and listening sessions. These tools provide employees throughout the globe an opportunity to provide confidential feedback on key areas known to drive employee engagement, including their satisfaction with their managers, their work and the Company generally. These tools also measure our employees' connection to NIKE's culture. NIKE also provides multiple points of contact for employees to speak up if they experience something that does not align with our values or otherwise violates our workplace policies, even if they are uncertain what they observed or heard is a violation of company policy.\nAs part of our commitment to making a positive impact on our communities, we maintain a goal of investing 2% of our prior fiscal year's pre-tax income into global communities. The focus of this investment continues to be inspiring youth to be active through play and sport as well as uniting and inspiring communities. Through our investments we bring the power of sport into our communities, with the goal of making play and sport more accessible. Our community investments are an important part of our culture, and we support employees in giving back to community organizations through volunteering and donations, which are matched by the NIKE Foundation where eligible.\nEMPLOYEE BASE\nAs of May 31, 2025, we had approximately 77,800 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. We also utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce.\nMost of our employees are not represented by unions, except for certain employees in the EMEA and APLA geographies who are members of and/or are represented by trade unions, as allowed or required by local law and/or collective bargaining agreements. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain subsidiary decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into, and/or comply with, industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.\nCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS \nNIKE's total rewards are intended to be competitive and equitable, meet the varied needs of our global teammates and reinforce our values. We are committed to providing comprehensive, competitive and equitable pay and benefits to our employees, and we have invested, and aim to continue to invest, in our employees through growth and development and holistic well-being initiatives.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through two distribution channels: NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), and to wholesale accounts, which include a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in nearly all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories. \nOur strategy is to achieve sustainable, profitable long-term revenue growth by leading with sport, creating innovative, \"must-have\" products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail. \nFISCAL 2025 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n•\nNIKE, Inc. Revenues for fiscal 2025 were $46.3 billion compared to $51.4 billion for fiscal 2024\n•\nNIKE Direct revenues declined 13% from $21.5 billion in fiscal 2024 to $18.8 billion in fiscal 2025, and represented approximately 42% of total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2025\n•\nNIKE Brand wholesale revenues decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a currency-neutral basis\n•\nGross margin decreased 190 basis points to 42.7%, primarily due to higher discounts, changes in channel mix and higher inventory obsolescence reserves, partially offset by lower product costs\n•\nInventories as of May 31, 2025 were $7.5 billion, flat compared to the prior year\n•\nWe returned $5.3 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2025 through share repurchases and dividends\n•\nReturn on Invested Capital (\"ROIC\") was 20.2% as of May 31, 2025, compared to 34.9% as of May 31, 2024. ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, see \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for additional information.\nOur results for fiscal 2025 reflected a decrease in traffic across NIKE Direct and our actions to reduce supply of certain footwear products in the marketplace through increased markdowns across NIKE Direct and discounts and higher sales returns with our wholesale partners, which negatively impacted our Revenues and gross margin.\nFor discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 25, 2024.\n2025 FORM 10-K   \n29\n \nTable of Contents\nFACTORS IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS\nWe are navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty and volatility in the operating environment \nincluding, but not limited to, geopolitical dynamics, tax regulation, fluctuating foreign exchange rates and new tariffs. As a result of the new tariffs, we expect to incur a material gross incremental increase to Cost of sales. Over the next several quarters, we are taking actions to mitigate the impact of the new tariffs, however for fiscal 2026, we expect a negative impact on gross margin. We will continue to monitor changes to the import and export policies of the U.S. and other countries that could require us to change the way in which we do business. These factors, and any changes to these factors, among others, could have a material adverse impact on consumer behavior and on our future Revenues and overall profitability. \nDespite these factors, we are focused on driving distinction within key sports, building a complete product portfolio, creating stories to inspire and emotionally connect with consumers, and elevating and growing the entire marketplace as we continue to take actions across the following areas:\n•\nProduct Management:\n Reducing the supply of certain footwear products in the marketplace as we shift to new and innovative products and rebalance the mix of our footwear portfolio.\n•\nMarketplace Management: \nRepositioning NIKE Brand Digital as a full-price platform and reinvesting in wholesale distribution. This includes liquidating inventory through increased markdowns across NIKE Direct, and higher sales returns and discounts with our wholesale partners to reduce inventory and create capacity for new product.\n•\nBrand Management:\n \nIncreasing investment in demand creation including brand marketing and sports marketing to support key product launches and sports moments.\nThese actions have had, and in the future could have, a negative impact on our Revenues and gross margin as well as higher Demand creation expense. However, we believe these actions will reignite brand momentum and reposition our business to drive long-term shareholder value.\nFor more information refer to Item 1A Risk Factors, within Part 1, Item 1, Business.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). References to these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. \nEarnings Before Interest and Taxes (\"EBIT\")\n: Calculated as Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period in place of the exchange rates in use during the current period.\nCOMPARABLE STORE SALES\nComparable store sales\n: This key metric, which excludes NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales represents a performance metric that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies.\n2025 FORM 10-K   \n31\n \nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\nFISCAL 2025\nFISCAL 2024\n% CHANGE\nFISCAL 2023\n% CHANGE\nRevenues\n$\n46,309 \n$\n51,362 \n-10 \n%\n$\n51,217 \n0 \n%\nCost of sales\n26,519 \n28,475 \n-7 \n%\n28,925 \n-2 \n%\nGross profit\n19,790 \n22,887 \n-14 \n%\n22,292 \n3 \n%\nGross margin\n42.7 \n%\n44.6 \n%\n43.5 \n%\nDemand creation expense\n4,689 \n4,285 \n9 \n%\n4,060 \n6 \n%\nOperating overhead expense\n11,399 \n12,291 \n-7 \n%\n12,317 \n0 \n%\nTotal selling and administrative expense\n16,088 \n16,576 \n-3 \n%\n16,377 \n1 \n%\n% of revenues\n34.7 \n%\n32.3 \n%\n32.0 \n%\nInterest expense (income), net\n(107)\n(161)\n— \n(6)\n— \nOther (income) expense, net\n(76)\n(228)\n— \n(280)\n— \nIncome before income taxes\n3,885 \n6,700 \n-42 \n%\n6,201 \n8 \n%\nIncome tax expense\n666 \n1,000 \n-33 \n%\n1,131 \n-12 \n%\nEffective tax rate\n17.1 \n%\n14.9 \n%\n18.2 \n%\nNET INCOME\n$\n3,219\n \n$\n5,700\n \n-44\n \n%\n$\n5,070\n \n12\n \n%\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n2.16 \n$\n3.73 \n-42 \n%\n$\n3.23 \n15 \n%\n \n2025 FORM 10-K       \n32\nTable of Contents\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS\nREVENUES\n(Dollars in millions)\nFISCAL 2025\nFISCAL 2024\n% CHANGE\n% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES\n(1)\nFISCAL 2023\n% CHANGE\n% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES\n(1)\nNIKE, Inc.

Revenues were $46.3 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $51.4 billion for fiscal 2024, which decreased 10% and 9% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively. On a currency-neutral basis, the decrease was primarily due to lower revenues in North America, Europe, Middle East & Africa (\"EMEA\") and Greater China which each decreased NIKE, Inc. Revenues by 4, 3 and 2 percentage points, respectively.\n•\nNIKE Brand revenues, which represented over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues,\n \ndecreased 9% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. The decrease, on a currency-neutral basis, was due to lower revenues in Men's, the Jordan Brand, Women's and Kids'.\n•\nNIKE Brand footwear revenues decreased 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Unit sales of footwear decreased 8%, while lower average selling price (\"ASP\") per pair reduced footwear revenues by approximately 3 percentage points. Lower ASP per pair was primarily due to higher discounts and changes in channel mix, partially offset by strategic pricing actions.\n•\nNIKE Brand apparel revenues decreased 5% on a currency-neutral basis. Unit sales of apparel decreased 5%, while ASP per unit was flat as strategic pricing actions were offset by changes in channel mix and higher discounts.\n•\nNIKE Brand wholesale revenues decreased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a currency-neutral basis, compared to fiscal 2024. The decrease, on a currency-neutral basis, was driven by lower revenues across all geographies.\n•\nNIKE Direct revenues were $18.8 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $21.5 billion in fiscal 2024. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues decreased 12% due to declines in NIKE Brand Digital sales of 20% from $12.1 billion in fiscal 2024 to $9.6 billion in fiscal 2025, while NIKE store sales were flat. Comparable store sales decreased 1%.

Gross margin decreased 190 basis points to 42.7% for fiscal 2025 compared to 44.6% for fiscal 2024 due to the following:\n•\nLower NIKE Brand ASP (decreasing gross margin approximately 180 basis points), primarily due to higher discounts and changes in channel mix, partially offset by strategic pricing actions;\n•\nHigher other costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 90 basis points), including higher inventory obsolescence reserves;\n•\nLower gross margin from Converse (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points); and\n•\nUnfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges (decreasing gross margin approximately 10 basis points).\nThis was partially offset by:\n•\nLower NIKE Brand product costs (increasing gross margin approximately 80 basis points);\n•\nLower warehousing and logistics costs (increasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points); and\n•\nRestructuring charges in the prior year (increasing gross margin approximately 10 basis points).\nTOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE\n(Dollars in millions)\nFISCAL 2025\nFISCAL 2024\n% CHANGE\nFISCAL 2023\n% CHANGE\nDemand creation expense\n(1)\n$\n4,689 \n$\n4,285 \n9 \n%\n$\n4,060 \n6 \n%\nOperating overhead expense\n(2)\n11,399 \n12,291 \n-7 \n%\n12,317 \n0 \n%\nTotal selling and administrative expense\n$\n16,088 \n$\n16,576 \n-3 \n%\n$\n16,377 \n1 \n%\n% of revenues\n34.7 \n%\n32.3 \n%\n240 \nbps\n32.0 \n%\n30 \nbps\n(1)\nDemand creation expense consists of brand marketing expense and sports marketing expense.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Demand creation expense.\nOperating overhead expense decreased 7%, due to restructuring charges in the prior year, lower wage-related expenses and lower other administrative costs.

These impacts were partially offset by a one-time, non-cash deferred tax benefit in fiscal 2025 provided by US tax regulations related to foreign currency gains and losses.\nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. government enacted The One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 which includes, among other provisions, changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including the allowance of immediate expensing of qualifying research and development expenses and permanent extensions of certain provisions within the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.\nOur foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (\"NTC\") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.\nTRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n•\nProduct Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1.\nProduct purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\na.\nCertain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\nb.\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories predominantly in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n2.\nFactory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denominated.\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\n•\nNon-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n•\nOther Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. \n2025 FORM 10-K       \n44\nTable of Contents\n•\nNon-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges. \nCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability being hedged. \nTRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $419 million for the year ended May 31, 2025. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $97 million for the year ended May 31, 2025.\nMANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\nTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. \nWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $188 million on our Income before income taxes for the year ended May 31, 2025.\nNET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES\nWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2025 and 2024. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023.\n2025 FORM 10-K   \n45\n \nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCASH FLOW ACTIVITY\n(Dollars in millions)\nFISCAL 2025\nFISCAL 2024\n$ CHANGE\nCash provided (used by):\nOperating activities\n$\n3,698 \n$\n7,429 \n$\n(3,731)\nInvesting activities\n(275)\n894 \n(1,169)\nFinancing activities\n(5,820)\n(5,888)\n68 \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents\n1 \n(16)\n17 \nNET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n$\n(2,396)\n$\n2,419\n \n$\n(4,815)\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $3,731 million. This was driven by a decrease of $2,228 million in Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in certain working capital components and other assets and liabilities, which decreased $1,503 million. The change in working capital was impacted by changes to Inventories, primarily due to reduced inventory purchases in the prior year as well as unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates in the current year.\nCash used by investing activities increased $1,169 million, from an inflow in fiscal 2024 to an outflow in fiscal 2025, primarily driven by the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases).\nCash used by financing activities decreased $68 million, primarily driven by lower share repurchases, largely offset by a $1.0 billion bond repayment and slightly higher dividend payments.\nIn fiscal 2025, we purchased a total of 37.6 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $3.0 billion (an average price of $78.50 per share) under the four-year, $18 billion share repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in June 2022. As of May 31, 2025, we had repurchased 122.6 million shares at a cost of approximately $12.0 billion (an average price of $98.00 per share) under this program. We have moderated, and intend to continue moderating, share repurchases. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our liquidity, capital needs and operating cash flows. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases from operating cash flows and excess cash. \nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nOn July 21, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf\") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 21, 2025, and we plan to file a new shelf registration with the SEC in July 2025.\nOn March 7, 2025, we entered into a 364-day committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 6, 2026, with an option to extend the maturity date an additional 364 days. This facility replaces the prior $1 billion 364-day credit facility agreement entered into on March 8, 2024, which matured on March 7, 2025. Refer to Note 5 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.\nOn March 7, 2025, we entered into a five-year committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $3 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 7, 2030, with options to extend the maturity date up to an additional two years. This facility replaces the prior $2 billion five-year credit facility agreement entered into on March 11, 2022, which would have matured on March 11, 2027. Refer to Note 5 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information. \nWe currently have long-term debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on March 7, 2025, if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fees and interest rates would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fees and interest rates would decrease. In July 2025, Standard and Poor's Corporation downgraded our debt rating from AA- to A+, and, as a result, our facility fees and interest rates will increase compared to what they were prior to the downgrade. Refer to Note 5 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under these facilities, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on the disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the applicable syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2025, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants, and we believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.\n2025 FORM 10-K       \n46\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity is also provided by our $3 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025 and 2024, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our $3 billion program. We may issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs. \nTo date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the capital or credit markets; however, future volatility may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.\nAs of May 31, 2025, we had Cash and equivalents and Short-term investments totaling $9.2 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major banks, money market funds, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2025, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 96 days.\nWe believe that existing Cash and equivalents, Short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\nOur material cash requirements as of May 31, 2025, were as follows:\n•\nDebt Obligations — Refer to Note 5 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 6 — Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nOperating Leases — Refer to Note 17 — Leases in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nEndorsement Contracts — As of May 31, 2025, we had endorsement contract obligations, including associated marketing commitments, of $16.2 billion, with $1.6 billion payable within 12 months, primarily representing approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than these amounts as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors and the contracts generally do not stipulate a minimum amount of cash to be spent on the product.\n•\nProduct Purchase Obligations — As of May 31, 2025, we had product purchase obligations of $7.9 billion, all of which are payable within the next 12 months. Product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms. We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.\n•\nOther Purchase Obligations — As of May 31, 2025, we had $3.1 billion of other purchase obligations, with $1.9 billion payable within the next 12 months. Other purchase obligations primarily include technology investments, construction, service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, and may include open purchase orders for non-product purchases. \nAs of May 31, 2025, we had approximately $260 million in estimated future income tax obligations payable within 12 months related to expected resolution with the Internal Revenue Service of certain U.S. federal income tax matters for fiscal years 2017 through 2019 related to transfer pricing adjustments, research and development credits and other items.\nAs a part of the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as of May 31, 2025, we had $268 million in estimated future cash payments payable within the next 12 months. These amounts represent the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which are reflected net of foreign tax credits we utilized.\nIn addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 7 — Income Taxes and Note 11 — Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively. \nRefer to Note 16 — Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our off-balance sheet arrangements, bank guarantees and letters of credit. \n2025 FORM 10-K   \n47\n \nTable of Contents\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of May 31, 2025, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our current and future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting estimates described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nBecause of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Within the context of these critical accounting estimates, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported. During fiscal 2025, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to develop the estimates discussed below.\nFor a description of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, refer to  Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSALES-RELATED RESERVES\nProvisions for anticipated sales returns consist of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\nEstimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers based on current marketplace needs. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made. For fiscal 2025, any variances between actual and expected sales-related reserves were not material to reported Revenues.\nRefer to Note 14 — Revenues in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nINVENTORY RESERVES\nWe make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand, market conditions, existing inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience with similar products. If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which such a determination is made.\nRefer to Inventory Valuation within Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n2025 FORM 10-K       \n48\nTable of Contents\nHEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES\nWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the designated notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the amount of anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When the amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below designated hedged levels and it is no longer probable the forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.\nRefer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nINCOME TAXES\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense. \nRefer to Note 7 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOTHER CONTINGENCIES\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and government investigations related to our business, products and actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, customs, tax, intellectual property and other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. \nRefer to Note 16 — Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n2025 FORM 10-K   \n49\n \nTable of Contents",
