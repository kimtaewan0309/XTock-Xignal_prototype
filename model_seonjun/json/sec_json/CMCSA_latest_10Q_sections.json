We present the operations of (1) our Connectivity & Platforms business in two segments: Residential Connectivity & Platforms and Business Services Connectivity; and (2) our Content & Experiences business in three segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks. The discussion and analysis that follows includes the results of the cable television networks and complementary digital platforms proposed to be included in the separation of Versant and does not reflect or give effect to what our results of operations and financial condition may be following the separation, if consummated. \nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Uncertain economic conditions, including as a result of geopolitical dynamics, changes in trade policies and foreign exchange rates could adversely affect demand for our products or services and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For a discussion of these factors and other risks, refer to Risk Factors in Item 1A of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConsolidated Operating Results\n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n(in millions, except per share data)\n2025\n2024\n%\n2025\n2024\n%\nRevenue\n$\n31,198 \n$\n32,070 \n(2.7)\n%\n$\n91,397 \n$\n91,817 \n(0.5)\n%\nCosts and Expenses:\nProgramming and production\n8,655 \n10,216 \n(15.3)\n24,646 \n27,000 \n(8.7)\nMarketing and promotion\n2,196 \n1,989 \n10.4 \n6,435 \n5,929 \n8.5 \nOther operating and administrative\n10,795 \n10,128 \n6.6 \n31,109 \n29,615 \n5.0 \nDepreciation\n2,353 \n2,219 \n6.0 \n6,934 \n6,548 \n5.9 \nAmortization \n1,666 \n1,659 \n0.4 \n5,089 \n4,421 \n15.1 \nTotal costs and expenses\n25,665 \n26,211 \n(2.1)\n74,213 \n73,512 \n1.0 \nOperating income\n5,534 \n5,859 \n(5.5)\n17,184 \n18,304 \n(6.1)\nInterest expense \n(1,128)\n(1,037)\n8.7 \n(3,283)\n(3,065)\n7.1 \nInvestment and other income (loss), net\n61 \n(3)\nNM\n9,705 \n(140)\nNM\nIncome before income taxes\n4,468 \n4,819 \n(7.3)\n23,607 \n15,099 \n56.3 \nIncome tax expense\n(1,218)\n(1,243)\n(2.0)\n(6,017)\n(3,906)\n54.0 \nNet income\n3,249 \n3,576 \n(9.1)\n17,590 \n11,192 \n57.2 \nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests \n(83)\n(53)\n55.3\n(241)\n(222)\n8.4 \nNet income attributable to Comcast Corporation\n$\n3,332\n \n$\n3,629\n \n(8.2)\n%\n$\n17,830\n \n$\n11,415\n \n56.2\n \n%\nBasic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders\n$\n0.91\n \n$\n0.94\n \n(3.7)\n%\n$\n4.79\n \n$\n2.92\n \n64.0\n \n%\nDiluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders\n$\n0.90\n \n$\n0.94\n \n(3.4)\n%\n$\n4.78\n \n$\n2.90\n \n64.5\n \n%\nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding – basic\n3,679 \n3,861 \n(4.7)\n%\n3,722 \n3,908 \n(4.8)\n%\nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding – diluted\n3,689 \n3,880 \n(4.9)\n%\n3,733 \n3,930 \n(5.0)\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(a)\n$\n9,669\n \n$\n9,735\n \n(0.7)\n%\n$\n29,484\n \n$\n29,261\n \n0.8\n \n%\nPercentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.\n(a)\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Consolidated revenue remained consistent for the nine months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025 compared to the same period in \n2024.\n Revenue for our segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.”\nConsolidated costs and expenses\n, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in \n2024 \nprimarily due to a decrease in the Content & Experiences business, partially offset by increases in the Connectivity and Platforms business and in Corporate and Other. Consolidated costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in \n2024 primarily due to a decrease in the Content & Experiences business. \nCosts and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated costs and expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 also increased due to transaction and transaction-related costs associated with the proposed separation of Versant that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and our segment operating results.\nConsolidated depreciation and amortization expense\n increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to increased depreciation due to the opening of Epic Universe in May 2025. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily due to increased amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets related to the linear media business, increased depreciation due to the opening of Epic Universe in May 2025 and impairments of certain long-lived assets in the current year period. \nAmortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled \n$824 million and $2.4 billion for\n the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, and\n $817 million\n and \n$1.9 billion\n for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011.\nConsolidated interest expense \nincreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily due to decreases in capitalized interest driven by the opening of Epic Universe, as well as increases in average debt outstanding and higher weighted-average interest rates in the current year periods.\nConsolidated investment and other income (loss), net \nincreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024.\n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nEquity in net income (losses) of investees, net\n$\n(90)\n$\n(152)\n$\n(312)\n$\n(438)\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net\n(60)\n(22)\n52 \n(163)\nOther income (loss), net\n212 \n171 \n9,966 \n461 \nTotal investment and other income (loss), net\n$\n61\n \n$\n(3)\n$\n9,705\n \n$\n(140)\nThe chang\ne in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net f\nor the three months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025 \ncompared to the same period in \n2024 was primarily due to our investment in Atairos. \nThe chang\ne in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net f\nor the nine months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025 \ncompared to the same period in \n2024 was primarily due to our investments in Atairos and Hulu. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income (loss) of $16 million and $(178) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, and $(93) million and $(289) million for the three and nine months ended \nSeptember 30, 2024\n, respectively.\nThe change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securi\nties, net for the three months ended September 30, 2025\n was primarily due to higher net unrealized losses on nonmarketable securities in the current year period. The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securi\nties, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2025\n was primarily due to a gain on the sale of a nonmarketable security in the current year period and due to higher net unrealized losses on nonmarketable and marketable securities in the prior year period.\nThe change in other income (loss), net for the three months ended September 30, 2025 primarily resulted from a gain on the sale of an equity method investment in the current year period. The change in other income (loss), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily resulted from a $9.4 billion gain from the sale of our interest in Hulu in the current year period (see Note 7).\n15\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated income tax expense\n for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily driven by lower domestic income before income taxes. The increase in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily driven by higher domestic income before income taxes.\nConsolidated net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n changed\n f\nor the \nthree and nine\n months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025 \ncompared to the same periods in \n2024 primarily due to Universal Beijing Resort.\n \nThe change for the \nnine\n months ended September 30, 2025 is also due to our regional sports networks.\nSegment Operating Results\nOur segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information.

The changes reflect the year-over-year basis point changes in the rounded Adjusted EBITDA margins. \n(b)\nConstant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 24 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of constant currency amounts.\n \nWe continue to focus on growing our higher-margin connectivity businesses while managing overall operating costs. We also continue to invest in our network to support higher-speed broadband offerings and to expand the number of homes and businesses passed. Our customer relationship additions/(losses) continue to be negatively impacted by an increasingly competitive environment. We are focused on increasing our residential connectivity revenue. In 2025, we simplified our broadband pricing structure and began offering a free wireless line for one year to new and existing domestic broadband customers, which we expect to improve customer retention and strengthen our ability to compete for new customers, but will negatively impact average domestic broadband revenue per customer. We also expect continued declines in video revenue as a result of domestic customer net losses due to shifting video consumption patterns and the competitive environment, although customer net losses typically mitigate the impact of continued rate increases on programming expenses, as well as continued declines in other revenue related to declines in wireline voice revenue. We are also focused on growing our Business Services Connectivity segment revenue by offering competitive services, including enterprise solutions.\n16\nTable of Contents\nConnectivity & Platforms Customer Metrics\n \nNet Additions / (Losses)\n \nSeptember 30,\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nCustomer Relationships\nDomestic Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships\n(a)\n30,642 \n31,324 \n(103)\n(103)\n(530)\n(324)\nInternational Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships\n(a)\n17,603 \n17,716 \n(95)\n78 \n(208)\n(131)\nBusiness Services Connectivity customer relationships\n(b)(c)\n2,702 \n2,627 \n(11)\n(4)\n(48)\n(14)\nTotal Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships\n50,947 \n51,667 \n(210)\n(29)\n(786)\n(469)\nDomestic Broadband\nResidential customers\n28,897 \n29,504 \n(91)\n(79)\n(475)\n(244)\nBusiness customers\n(b)(c)\n2,538 \n2,477 \n(13)\n(8)\n(54)\n(28)\nTotal domestic broadband customers\n31,436 \n31,981 \n(104)\n(87)\n(530)\n(272)\nDomestic Wireless \nTotal domestic wireless lines\n(d)\n8,941 \n7,519 \n414 \n319 \n1,115 \n930 \nDomestic Video\nTotal domestic video customers\n11,515 \n12,834\n(257)\n(365)\n(1,008)\n(1,272)\nDomestic homes and businesses passed\n(e)\n64,639\n63,355\nDomestic broadband penetration of homes and businesses passed\n(f)\n48.2 \n%\n50.3 \n%\n(a)\nResidential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships generally represent the number of residential customer locations that subscribe to at least one of our services. International Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships represent customers receiving Sky services in the United Kingdom and Italy. Because each of our services includes a variety of product tiers, which may change from time to time, net additions or losses in any one period will reflect a mix of customers at various tiers. \n(b)\nBusiness Services Connectivity customer metrics are generally counted based on the number of connections receiving services, including connections within our network in the United States, as well as connections outside of our network both in the United States and internationally. Certain arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our network are also generally counted based on the number of connections served.\n(c)\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, Business Services Connectivity customer relationships and Domestic Broadband Business customers include connections from the acquisition of Nitel and other conforming changes, resulting in an increase of 124,000 Business Services Connectivity customer relationships and 123,000 domestic broadband business customers as of April 1, 2025. Because these adjustments were made as of April 1, 2025, they are not reflected in prior period customer metrics or in net additions/(losses) in prior and current year periods.\n(d)\nDomestic wireless lines represent the number of residential and business customers\n’\n wireless devices. An individual customer relationship may have multiple wireless lines.\n(e)\nConnectivity & Platforms domestic homes and businesses are considered passed if we can connect them to our network in the United States without further extending the transmission lines. Homes and businesses passed is an estimate based on the best available information.\n(f)\nPenetration is calculated by dividing the number of domestic customers located within our network by the number of domestic homes and businesses passed. \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nConstant Currency Change\n(a)\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nConstant Currency Change\n(a)\n2025\n2024\n%\n%\n2025\n2024\n%\n%\nAverage monthly total Connectivity & Platforms revenue per customer relationship\n$\n131.74 \n$\n130.87 \n0.7 \n%\n(0.2)\n%\n$\n131.54 \n$\n130.19 \n1.0 \n%\n0.5 \n%\nAverage monthly total Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship\n$\n52.29 \n$\n53.50 \n(2.3)\n%\n(2.5)\n%\n$\n53.90 \n$\n53.51 \n0.7 \n%\n0.5 \n%\n(a)\nConstant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure.

While revenue from our individual service offerings is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses.\nConnectivity & Platforms — Supplemental Costs and Expenses Information\nConnectivity & Platforms supplemental costs and expenses information in the table below is presented on an aggregate basis across the Connectivity & Platforms segments as the segments use certain shared infrastructure, including our network in the United States.

Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the current year presentation.\nResidential Connectivity & Platforms Segment – Revenue\nDomestic broadband revenue\n \nremained consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 due to an increase in average rates, offset by a decline in the number of domestic broadband customers.\nDomestic broadband revenue increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 due to an increase in average rates, partially offset by a decline in the number of domestic broadband customers.\nDomestic wireless revenue \nincreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 due to increases in the number of customer lines and device sales. \nInternational connectivity revenue\n increased for the three and nine\n months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024\n due to increases in broadband revenue resulting from increases in average rates and increases in wireless revenue resulting from increases in the sale of wireless services. The increases for the three and nine\n months ended September 30, 2025 include the positive impact of foreign currency.\nVideo \nrevenue\n decreased for the \nthree and nine\n months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 due to declines in the overall number of video customers, partially offset by overall increases in average rates and the positive impact of foreign currency. \nAdvertising \nrevenue\n decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to lower domestic political and nonpolitical advertising.\nOther \nrevenue\n decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to decreases in residential wireline voice revenue driven by declines in the number of customers. \nResidential Connectivity & Platforms Segment – Costs and Expenses\nProgramming expenses\n decreased for the \nthree and nine months ended\n September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to declines in the number of domestic video subscribers, partially offset by rate increases under our domestic programming contracts, increases in programming expenses for our international sports networks and the impact of foreign currency.\nOther expenses\n increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to increased direct product costs, the impact of foreign currency and increased spending on marketing and promotion, partially offset by a decrease in fees paid to third-party channels relating to advertising sales.\n19\nTable of Contents\nOther expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to increased direct product costs, increased spending on marketing and promotion, and the impact of foreign currency, partially offset by lower franchise and other regulatory fees and a decrease in fees paid to third-party channels relating to advertising sales. \nBusiness Services Connectivity Segment Results of Operations\n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n%\n2025\n2024\n%\nRevenue\n$\n2,576 \n$\n2,425 \n6.2 \n%\n$\n7,647 \n$\n7,253 \n5.4 \n%\nCosts and expenses\n1,122 \n1,034 \n8.5\n3,327 \n3,117 \n6.7\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,454\n \n$\n1,391\n \n4.5\n \n%\n$\n4,320\n \n$\n4,137\n \n4.4\n \n%\nBusiness services connectivity revenue\n increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to increases in revenue from enterprise solutions offerings, including the results from Nitel, which was acquired in April 2025.\nBusiness services connectivity costs and expenses\n increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to increases in direct product costs, which includes the results from Nitel.\nContent & Experiences Results of Operations\n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n%\n2025\n2024\n%\nRevenue\nMedia\n$\n6,589 \n$\n8,231 \n(19.9)\n%\n$\n19,470 \n$\n20,926 \n(7.0)\n%\nStudios\n3,000 \n2,826 \n6.1 \n8,258 \n7,822 \n5.6 \nTheme Parks\n2,717 \n2,289 \n18.7 \n6,943 \n6,243 \n11.2 \nHeadquarters and Other\n15 \n11 \n40.9 \n35 \n32 \n7.5 \nEliminations\n(580)\n(758)\n23.4 \n(1,883)\n(1,994)\n5.6 \nTotal Content & Experiences revenue\n$\n11,742\n \n$\n12,599\n \n(6.8)\n%\n$\n32,823\n \n$\n33,030\n \n(0.6)\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\nMedia\n$\n832 \n$\n650 \n28.0 \n%\n$\n3,318 \n$\n2,832 \n17.2 \n%\nStudios\n365 \n468 \n(21.9)\n749 \n835 \n(10.4)\nTheme Parks\n958 \n847 \n13.1 \n2,045 \n2,111 \n(3.1)\nHeadquarters and Other\n(271)\n(200)\n(35.5)\n(789)\n(642)\n(22.9)\nEliminations\n69 \n38 \n81.8 \n140 \n108 \n29.6 \nTotal Content & Experiences Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,953\n \n$\n1,802\n \n8.4\n \n%\n$\n5,462\n \n$\n5,244\n \n4.2\n \n%\nWe operate our Media segment as a combined television and streaming business.

We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to content and marketing at Peacock. Revenue and programming expenses are also impacted by the timing of certain sporting events, including the Paris Olympics in the third quarter of 2024, and our acquisition of NBA rights, which begin in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nOur Studios segment generates revenue primarily from third parties and from licensing content to our Media segment. While results of operations for our Studios segment are not impacted, results for our total Content & Experiences business may be impacted as the Studios segment licenses content to the Media segment, including for Peacock, rather than licensing the content to third parties.\nWe continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including Epic Universe in Orlando, which opened in May 2025, as well as in new destinations and experiences, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks.\n20\nTable of Contents\nMedia Segment Results of Operations\n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nChange\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n%\n2025\n2024\n%\nRevenue\nDomestic advertising\n$\n1,964 \n$\n3,347 \n(41.3)\n%\n$\n5,698 \n$\n7,363 \n(22.6)\n%\nDomestic distribution\n2,841 \n3,272 \n(13.1)\n8,575 \n8,942 \n(4.1)\nInternational networks\n1,252 \n1,070 \n17.0 \n3,681 \n3,193 \n15.3 \nOther\n532 \n542 \n(1.8)\n1,516 \n1,429 \n6.1 \nTotal revenue\n6,589\n \n8,231\n \n(19.9)\n19,470\n \n20,926\n \n(7.0)\nCosts and Expenses\nProgramming and production\n4,297 \n5,917 \n(27.4)\n11,860 \n13,652 \n(13.1)\nMarketing and promotion\n321 \n470 \n(31.9)\n947 \n1,071 \n(11.6)\nOther\n1,140 \n1,194 \n(4.5)\n3,344 \n3,371 \n(0.8)\nTotal costs and expenses\n5,758 \n7,581 \n(24.1)\n16,152 \n18,094 \n(10.7)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n832\n \n$\n650\n \n28.0\n \n%\n$\n3,318\n \n$\n2,832\n \n17.2\n \n%\nMedia Segment – Revenue\nRevenue decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to the Paris Olympics in the third quarter of 2024.

We had 41 million and 36 million paid subscribers of Peacock as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Peacock paid subscribers represent customers from which we recognize distribution revenue, including both customers that pay us directly and customers receiving the service through arrangements with companies who sell Peacock on our behalf. In these arrangements, paid subscribers are counted based on the terms of the arrangement when the related revenue is recognized. As a result, certain customers are counted when they activate their account, while other customers are counted when the Peacock service is made available to them as part of their bundled service offering regardless of whether it is activated. The increase in paid subscribers in 2025 is mainly due to the availability of Peacock through a third-party’s bundled service offering.\nMedia Segment – Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and production costs\n decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to costs associated with the Paris Olympics in the prior year period and a decrease in other sports programming costs at our domestic television networks, mainly reflecting lower sports volumes compared to the prior year period. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sports programming costs for our international television networks.\nProgramming and production costs decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to costs associated with the Paris Olympics in the prior year period, a decrease in other sports programming costs at our domestic television networks, mainly reflecting lower sports volumes compared to the prior year period, and lower programming costs at Peacock.

This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. \n24\nTable of Contents\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. \nWe reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation.

Certain of our businesses, including Connectivity & Platforms, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Connectivity & Platforms business, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the businesses, and we believe they are helpful for investors because such measures present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to allow the evaluation of their underlying performance.\nConstant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current year period presented rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods.\n25\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of Connectivity & Platforms Constant Currency\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\n(in millions)\nAs Reported\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nConstant Currency Amounts\nAs Reported\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nConstant Currency Amounts\nRevenue\nResidential Connectivity & Platforms\n$\n17,866 \n$\n167 \n$\n18,033 \n$\n53,558 \n$\n340 \n$\n53,898 \nBusiness Services Connectivity \n2,425 \n1 \n2,425 \n7,253 \n2 \n7,255 \nTotal Connectivity & Platforms revenue\n$\n20,291\n \n$\n168\n \n$\n20,458\n \n$\n60,812\n \n$\n342\n \n$\n61,153\n \nAdjusted EBITDA\nResidential Connectivity & Platforms \n$\n6,904 \n$\n24 \n$\n6,928 \n$\n20,859 \n$\n55 \n$\n20,914 \nBusiness Services Connectivity\n1,391 \n— \n1,391 \n4,137 \n(1)\n4,136 \nTotal Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n8,295\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n8,318\n \n$\n24,996\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n25,050\n \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\nResidential Connectivity & Platforms \n38.6 \n%\n(20) bps\n38.4 \n%\n38.9 \n%\n(10) bps\n38.8 \n%\nBusiness Services Connectivity\n57.4 \n(10) bps\n57.3 \n57.0 \n - bps\n57.0 \nTotal Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA margin\n40.9\n \n%\n(20) bps\n40.7\n \n%\n41.1\n \n%\n(10) bps\n41.0\n \n%\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nAs Reported\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nConstant Currency Amounts\nAs Reported\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nConstant Currency Amounts\nAverage monthly total Connectivity & Platforms revenue per customer relationship\n$\n130.87 \n$\n1.08 \n$\n131.95 \n$\n130.19 \n$\n0.73 \n$\n130.92 \nAverage monthly total Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship\n$\n53.50 \n$\n0.15 \n$\n53.65 \n$\n53.51 \n$\n0.12 \n$\n53.63 \nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\n(in millions)\nAs Reported\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nConstant Currency Amounts\nAs Reported\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nConstant Currency Amounts\nCosts and Expenses\nProgramming\n$\n4,102 \n$\n53 \n$\n4,156 \n$\n12,756 \n$\n105 \n$\n12,862 \nTechnical and support\n1,908 \n17 \n1,926 \n5,712 \n31 \n5,743 \nDirect product costs\n1,675 \n34 \n1,710 \n4,705 \n70 \n4,775 \nMarketing and promotion\n1,234 \n12 \n1,246 \n3,547 \n22 \n3,569 \nCustomer service\n680 \n6 \n686 \n2,072 \n12 \n2,084 \nOther\n2,395 \n22 \n2,417 \n7,023 \n47 \n7,070 \nTotal Connectivity & Platforms costs and expenses\n$\n11,996\n \n$\n144\n \n$\n12,140\n \n$\n35,816\n \n$\n287\n \n$\n36,103\n \n26\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of Residential Connectivity & Platforms Constant Currency\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\n(in millions)\nAs Reported\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nConstant Currency Amounts\nAs Reported\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nConstant Currency Amounts\nRevenue\nDomestic broadband\n$\n6,400 \n$\n— \n$\n6,400 \n$\n19,276 \n$\n— \n$\n19,276 \nDomestic wireless\n1,093 \n— \n1,093 \n3,084 \n— \n3,084 \nInternational connectivity\n1,150 \n44 \n1,194 \n3,240 \n95 \n3,334 \nTotal residential connectivity\n8,644 \n44 \n8,688 \n25,599 \n95 \n25,694 \nVideo\n6,938 \n97 \n7,034 \n21,055 \n187 \n21,242 \nAdvertising\n987 \n12 \n999 \n2,931 \n29 \n2,959 \nOther\n1,298 \n14 \n1,312 \n3,973 \n30 \n4,003 \nTotal revenue\n17,866\n \n167\n \n18,033\n \n53,558\n \n340\n \n53,898\n \nCosts and Expenses\nProgramming\n4,102 \n53 \n4,156 \n12,756 \n105 \n12,862 \nOther\n6,860 \n90 \n6,950 \n19,943 \n179 \n20,123 \nTotal costs and expenses\n10,962 \n143 \n11,105 \n32,699 \n285 \n32,984 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n6,904\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n6,928\n \n$\n20,859\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n20,914\n \nOther Adjustments\nFrom time to time, we present adjusted information, such as revenue, to exclude the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges.

We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cas\nh equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders. \nWe maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper program generally provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. As of September 30, 2025, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.8 billion. \nOur revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant pertaining to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to EBITDA, as defined in the agreement. Compliance with this financial covenant is tested on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2025, we met this financial covenant, and we expect to remain in compliance with this financial covenant.\n27\nTable of Contents\nOperating Activit\nies\nComponents of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n \nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nOperating income\n$\n17,184 \n$\n18,304 \nDepreciation and amortization\n12,023 \n10,969 \nNoncash share-based compensation\n1,014 \n983 \nChanges in operating assets and liabilities\n(783)\n(2,652)\nPayments of interest\n(2,682)\n(2,503)\nPayments of income taxes\n(2,378)\n(5,988)\nProceeds from investments and other\n423 \n480 \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n24,802\n \n$\n19,593\n \nThe variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily related to decreases in receivables, the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including the timing of sports, the timing of our accounts payable, and increases in deferred revenue, which includes the impact of the Paris Olympics, partially offset by increases in inventory.\nPayments of interest increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to increased debt balances following debt issuances in the current year period, decreased capitalized interest driven by the opening of Epic Universe and higher weighted-average interest rates.\nPayments of income taxes decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to higher payments in the prior year period relating to the preceding tax year, primarily driven by the taxable gain recognized on our investment in Hulu, and additional deductions allowed under new legislation effective in the current year period. The decreases were partially offset by the timing of transferable tax credit purchases. \nOn July 4, 2025, legislation was signed into law in the United States that reduced payments of income taxes beginning in the third quarter of 2025. The legislation will continue to significantly reduce payments of income taxes over the next several years, with variability across the years. Among other things, this legislation provides for immediate deduction of 100% of the costs of qualified property, including significant portions of our capital expenditures and film and television production costs, acquired and placed into service after January 19, 2025, compared to the 40% and 20% deductions that would have applied in 2025 and 2026, respectively, under prior law. The legislation also reinstates the immediate deduction of domestic research and development expenses, retroactive to 2022, repealing the prior requirement to capitalize and amortize such costs over five years.\nWe expect to receive a federal income tax refund in the current year as a result of carrying back a capital loss created primarily as part of a 2024 internal corporate reorganization to offset capital gains recognized in our federal income tax returns for 2021 through 2023.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to the acquisition of Nitel in 2025, the purchase of an equity method investment in the current year period and proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments in the prior year period, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments in the prior year period, $439 million of additional proceeds received in the current year period for the sale of our interest in Hulu (see Note 7), decreased capital expenditures and proceeds from the sale of a nonmarketable security in the current year period. Capital expenditures decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily reflecting decreased spending on Epic Universe driven by the opening in 2025, partially offset by increased spending by the Connectivity & Platforms businesses primarily on customer premise equipment, scalable infrastructure and line extensions. \nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in \n2024\n primarily due to lower proceeds from borrowings and increased repurchases and repayments of debt in the current year period, partially offset by lower\n repurchases of common stock in the current year period\n.\n28\nTable of Contents\nIn May 2025, we issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes, which have maturities ranging between 2032 and 2055 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.51%. The net proceeds from this issuance were intended for the early redemption of all outstanding amounts of our $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.375% Notes due August 2025, which was completed in June 2025, and for general corporate purposes.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we made debt repayments of $4.4 billion, including $2.6 billion of 3.950% Notes due October 2025 and $1.2 billion of 3.375% Notes due August 2025, as well as $419 million principal amount of notes due at maturity.\nIn October 2025, we completed debt exchange transactions and concurrent tender offers. We issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of new 5.17% senior notes due 2037 and made cash payments of approximately $0.8 billion in exchange for $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of certain series of outstanding senior notes with maturities ranging from 2027 to 2029 and a weighted-average interest rate of 4.01%. These transactions will not have a material impact on our interest expense or on our overall weighted-average interest rate or weighted-average maturity for our total outstanding debt.\nWe have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outst\nan\nding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. In particular, we may repurchase varying amounts of our outstanding public notes and debentures with short to medium term maturities through privately negotiated or market transactions. See Notes 5\n and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.\nAdditionally, in October 2025, in anticipation of the separation of Versant, Versant entered into a credit agreement with respect to a $1.0 billion senior secured term A loan facility due January 2031 (the “Term A Loan Facility”) and a $750 million revolving credit facility due January 2031 (the “Versant Revolving Credit Facility”). Versant also intends to enter into a credit agreement with respect to a $1.0 billion term B loan facility due January 2031 (the “Term B Loan Facility”). The Versant Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be undrawn on the separation date, the Term A Loan Facility will be funded on the separation date, and the Term B Loan Facility is expected to be funded on the separation date. In October 2025, Versant also entered into an indenture pursuant to which Versant issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior secured notes due January 2031 (the “Notes”). The Notes are subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the separation of Versant from Comcast is not consummated by March 2, 2026. The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes were deposited in an escrow account in favor of the trustee, together with certain additional cash contributed by Comcast. On the separation date, Versant intends to use a portion of the proceeds of such indebtedness to make a cash payment of approximately $2.25 billion to Comcast.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased a total of 152 million shares of our Class A common stock for $5.3 billion. In January 2025, our Board of Directors terminated the existing share repurchase program authorization and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15.0 billion, which has no expiration date. As of September 30, 2025, we had $10.4 billion re\nmaining under the authorization. We did not purchase any shares outside of this program. W\ne expect to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock under this new authorization in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions.\nIn addition, we paid $356 million and $328 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans and excise taxes related to share repurchases.\nIn January 2025, our Board of Directors approved a 6.5% increase in our dividend to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we paid dividends of \n$3.7 billion.\n In July 2025, our Board of Directors approved our third quarter dividend of $0.33 per share, which was paid in October 2025. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directo\nr\ns.\nGuarantee Structure\nOur debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.\n29\nTable of Contents\nDebt and Guarantee Structure\n(in billions)\nSeptember 30,\n2025\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDebt Subject to Cross-Guarantees\nComcast\n$\n93.9 \n$\n94.6 \nNBCUniversal\n(a)\n1.6 \n1.6 \nComcast Cable\n(a)\n0.9 \n0.9 \n96.5 \n97.1 \nDebt Subject to One-Way Guarantees\nSky\n3.3 \n3.0 \nOther\n(a)\n0.1 \n0.1 \n3.4 \n3.1 \nDebt Not Guaranteed\nUniversal Beijing Resort\n(b)\n3.5 \n3.4 \nOther\n1.5 \n1.4 \n5.0 \n4.8 \nDebt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net\n(5.9)\n(6.0)\nTotal debt\n$\n99.1\n \n$\n99.1\n \n(a)\nNBCUniversal Media, LLC (“NBCUniversal”), Comcast Cable Communications, LLC (“Comcast Cable”) and Comcast Holdings Corporation (“Comcast Holdings”), which is included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees, are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC.

See Note \n7\n for additional information.\nCross-Guarantees\nComcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. \nThe Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. \nAs of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $103 billion and $88 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $14 billion for both periods. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.\nOne-Way Guarantees\nComcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky Limited (“Sky\n”)\n, including all of its senior notes, and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC.\n30\nTable of Contents\nComcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis, and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. \nAs of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $69 billion and $53 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $10 billion for both periods. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt, and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nFor a more complete discussion of the accounting estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K."
