Dow Jones Newswires is also used as an input for algorithms supporting automated trading.\n \nThe Dow Jones segment’s businesses compete with a wide range of media and information businesses, including digital media, print publications and information services.\nThe Dow Jones segment’s consumer products, including its digital publications, newspapers, magazines, podcasts and video, compete for consumers, audience and advertising with other local and national newspapers, web and app-based media, news aggregators, customized news feeds, search engines, blogs, magazines, investment tools, social media sources, podcasts and event producers, as well as other media such as television, radio stations and outdoor displays. Competition for subscriptions and \n4\nTable of Contents\ncirculation is based on news and editorial content, data and analytics content in research tools, subscription pricing, the usefulness and popularity of its digital products, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. Competition for advertising is based upon advertisers’ judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors, including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates, advertising effectiveness and brand strength and reputation. As a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies (including developments in AI, particularly generative AI), distribution platforms and business models, and corresponding changes in consumer behavior, the consumer-focused businesses within the Dow Jones segment continue to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue, including from a variety of alternative news and information sources, programmatic advertising buying channels and AI aggregators and other emerging technology platforms. Shifts in consumer behavior require the Company to continually innovate and improve upon its own products, services and platforms in order to remain competitive. The Company believes that these changes will continue to pose opportunities and challenges, and that it is well positioned to leverage its global reach, brand recognition and proprietary technology to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these changes.\nThe Dow Jones segment’s professional information products that target enterprise customers compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers, global financial newswires and energy and commodities pricing and data providers, including Reuters News, RELX (including LexisNexis and ICIS), Refinitiv, S&P Global, DTN and Argus Media, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data. The professional information business also faces increasing competition from a variety of AI-powered platforms and services.\nDigital Real Estate Services \nThe Company’s Digital Real Estate Services segment consists of its 61.4% interest in REA Group, a publicly-traded company listed on ASX (ASX: REA), and its 80% interest in Move.

REA Group’s other assets include a 20% interest in Move, as referenced above. REA Group’s businesses outside Australia derive the majority of their revenue from their property advertising listing products and monthly advertising subscriptions from real estate agents and property developers.\n5\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Services \nREA Group’s financial services business encompasses a digital property search and financing experience and mortgage broking services under its Mortgage Choice brand. REA Group has continued to execute on its financial services strategy by improving broker productivity and increasing penetration of Mortgage Choice white label products, supported by REA Group’s partnership with digital lender Athena Home Loans. The financial services business generates revenue primarily through commissions from lenders.\nMove \nMove is a leading provider of digital real estate services in the U.S. Move primarily operates Realtor.com\n®\n, a premier real estate information, advertising and services platform, under a perpetual agreement and trademark license with the National Association of Realtors\n®\n (“NAR”).

See “Part I.

These businesses compete primarily with companies that provide real-estate focused technology, products and services in their respective geographic markets, including other real estate and property websites and apps in Australia, the U.S. and India.\nBook Publishing \nThe Company’s Book Publishing segment consists of HarperCollins, the second largest consumer book publisher in the world based on global revenue, with operations in 15 countries. HarperCollins publishes and distributes consumer books globally through print and digital formats.

Digital sales, comprising revenues generated through the sale of e-books and downloadable and streaming audiobooks, represented approximately 24% of global consumer revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\nDuring fiscal 2025, HarperCollins U.S. had 164 titles on the \nNew York Times\n print and digital bestseller lists, with 19 titles hitting number one, including \nCher: The Memoir Part One\n by Cher, \nHillbilly Elegy\n by J.D. Vance, \nWicked\n by Gregory Maguire, \nWatch Me\n by Tahereh Mafi, \nA Death in Cornwall\n by Daniel Silva, \nLittle Blue Truck and Racer Red\n by Alice Schertle, \nA Study in Drowning\n by Ava Reid, \nThe Strawberry Patch Pancake House\n by Laurie Gilmore, \nFight\n by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, \nMostly What God Does is Love You\n by Savannah Guthrie, \nImminent\n by Luis Elizondo, \nUnder His Wings\n by Emily Compagno, \nFahrenheit-182\n by Mark Hoppus with Dan Ozzi, \nSeven Things You Can’t Say About China\n by Tom Cotton, \nShameless \nby Brian Tyler Cohen, \nA Long Walk to Water \nby Linda Sue Park, \nThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever \nby Barbara Robinson and \nYou Can Be a Good Friend (No Matter What!) \nby Taraji P. Henson.\nHarperCollins derives its revenue from the sale and licensing of print and digital books to a customer base that includes global technology companies, traditional brick and mortar booksellers, wholesale clubs and discount stores, including Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble and Tesco. Revenues at the Book Publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of HarperCollins’ books in the marketplace and are typically highest during the Company’s second fiscal quarter due to increased demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. \nThe book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market that is quickly changing and continues to see technological innovations. HarperCollins competes with other large publishers, such as Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, Hachette Livre and Macmillan, as well as with numerous smaller publishers, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities; competition could also come from new entrants as barriers to entry in book publishing are low. In addition, HarperCollins competes for consumers with other media formats and sources such as movies, television programming, magazines and mobile content. The Company believes HarperCollins is well positioned in the evolving book publishing market with significant size and brand recognition across multiple categories and geographies. \nNews Media\nThe Company’s News Media segment consists primarily of News Corp Australia, News UK and the \nNew York Post\n.

The News Media segment generates revenue primarily through circulation and subscription sales of its print and digital products, sales of print and digital advertising and licensing fees. Advertising revenues at the News Media segment are subject to seasonality, with revenues typically highest in the Company’s second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies.\nNews Corp Australia\nNews Corp Australia is one of the leading news and information providers in Australia by readership, with both digital and print mastheads covering a national, regional and suburban footprint.

See “Part I. Business—Explanatory Note Regarding Certain Metrics.”\nNew York Post\nNYP Holdings is the publisher of the \nNew York Post\n (the “\nPost\n”), NYPost.com, PageSix.com, Decider.com and related mobile apps and social media channels. The \nPost\n is the oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the U.S., with a focus on coverage of the New York metropolitan area. The \nPost\n provides a variety of general interest content ranging from breaking news to business analysis, and is known in particular for its comprehensive sports coverage, famous headlines and its iconic Page Six section, an authority on celebrity news. The print version of the \nPost\n is primarily distributed in New York, as well as throughout the Northeast, Florida and California. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, average weekday circulation based on internal sources, including mobile app digital editions, was 498,984. In addition, the Post Digital Network, which includes NYPost.com, PageSix.com and Decider.com, averaged approximately 89.2 million unique users per month during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 according to Google Analytics. See “Part I. Business—Explanatory Note Regarding Certain Metrics” for information regarding the calculation of unique users.\nThe News Media segment’s newspapers, magazines, digital publications, radio stations, broadcast and streaming channels and podcasts generally face competition from similar sources, and compete on similar bases, as the consumer products within the Dow Jones segment, particularly in their respective operating geographies. See “Item 1. Business – Business Overview – Dow Jones” above for further information.\nOther\nThe Other segment includes the Company’s general corporate overhead expenses, strategy costs and costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters.\nGovernmental Regulation\nGeneral\nVarious aspects of the Company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. The introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Company’s products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in existing laws and regulations in those countries or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a negative impact on the Company’s interests.\nBenchmark Regulation\nIn connection with Dow Jones Energy’s OPIS business, the Company has established its own benchmark administrator, OPIS Benchmark Administration B.V. (the “Administrator”), organized in the Netherlands and authorized under the EU Benchmarks Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “EU BMR”) by the Netherlands Authority for Financial Markets (the “AFM”). The Administrator oversees compliance with principles, policies and procedures governing conflicts of interest, complaints handling, input data, benchmark methodologies and other matters for any price assessments and benchmarks under its administration. The Administrator has published on its website policies and other materials governing such administration, including a benchmark statement as well as policies and procedures concerning methodologies, complaints, corrections and material changes.\nThe Administrator currently oversees two OPIS price assessments, which are not presently used as a reference for trading on a European Union (“E.U.”) exchange and consequently are not benchmarks within the meaning of the EU BMR and not subject to supervision by the AFM. The OPIS business has also aligned its oil and commodities price reporting, including the two price assessments currently administered by the Administrator, with the International Organisation of Securities Commission’s (“IOSCO’s”) Principles for Oil Reporting Agencies, which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil and commodity price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members.\n9\nTable of Contents\nData Privacy and Security Regulation\nIn the course of its business, the Company collects, stores, uses and transmits personal data from consumers, customers, employees and other sources. Certain of the Company’s information services businesses also use content that includes personal data from public and government records, other publicly available information and media. As a result, the Company and its activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing and transfer, storage and retention of personal data, as well as multiple emerging laws and regulations pertaining to data security, which continue to evolve and have implications for a number of its business practices. In the U.S., a number of state and local governments have expanded, enacted or proposed data privacy laws that govern the collection and use of personal data of their residents and establish or increase penalties and in some cases, afford private rights of action to individuals for failure to comply, and all states have enacted legislation requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personal information has been accessed or disclosed as a result of certain data breaches. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CCPA”), establishes certain transparency rules, puts greater restrictions on how the Company can collect, use and disclose personal information of California residents and provides California residents with certain rights regarding their personal information, including rights to access, correct and delete their personal information and opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, brought through enforcement actions by the California Attorney General and California Privacy Protection Agency, as well as a private right of action for data breaches of certain types of nonencrypted and nonredacted personal information. California’s privacy regulators have been active in enforcing the CCPA’s requirements, particularly with regard to ensuring individual rights relating to targeted advertising are offered and honored by entities effectively. Similar laws in many states impose transparency and other obligations with respect to personal data of their respective residents and provide residents with similar rights. Certain of the Company’s websites, mobile apps and other online business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the online privacy of children, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which prohibits the collection of personal information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent; the California Age Appropriate Design Code (which went into effect in July 2024, but enforcement of which is currently stayed pending appeal), which prescribes rules relating to the design of online services likely to be accessed by children under age 18 (“CAADC”); and the New York Child Data Protection Act (which went into effect in June 2025), which imposes strict limitations on processing, sharing and selling the personal data of users under 18. National security imperatives have also significantly expanded restrictions on the access by and transfer of broadly defined categories of sensitive personal data and U.S. government data to “countries of concern” pursuant to U.S. Department of Justice data regulations effective in April 2025, which may impact certain of the Company’s current or potential partner, vendor, service provider and customer relationships.\nSimilar laws and regulations apply in many of the other jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including the E.U., the U.K. and Australia. Several of the Company’s business units are subject to the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which provides a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the E.U., and the \nUK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”). \nThe GDPR and UK GDPR expand the regulation of the collection, processing, use, sharing and security of personal data, contain stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthen the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continue to restrict the trans-border flow of personal data, require companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, require mandatory data breach reporting and notification, significantly increase maximum penalties for non-compliance (up to 20 million euros or 17.5 million pounds, as applicable, or 4% of an entity’s worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) and increase the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. In June 2025, the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (“DUA Act”), which amends the UK GDPR and the UK’s Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (“PECR”), became law. The DUA Act raises maximum fines under PECR to match the UK GDPR, increasing the potential financial exposure for breaches relating to direct marketing and online tracking, and amends the UK GDPR in certain respects. The changes set out in the DUA Act have created differences between the U.K. and E.U. legal regimes, further increasing compliance costs. In addition, the U.K. has adopted the UK Age Appropriate Design Code, which is similar to the CAADC discussed above.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe Company and some of its service providers rely on certain mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, to address the E.U. and U.K. data protection requirements for transfers of data that continue to evolve and are often subject to uncertainty and legal challenges. The European Commission has adopted two sets of European Union Standard Contractual Clauses, which regulate the relationship between controller and processor in accordance with the GDPR and international data transfers to a third country in the absence of an adequacy decision under the GDPR. The European Data Protection Board also adopted recommendations on measures that supplement data transfer tools to ensure compliance with the level of personal data protection required in Europe, including requirements for data exporters to assess the risks related to the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area and to implement, if necessary, additional contractual, organizational and technical measures such as encryption and pseudonymization. For data transfers subject to the UK GDPR, the International Data Transfer Agreement and the International Data Transfer Addendum to the European Union Standard Contractual Clauses have also been adopted. With respect to data transfers from the E.U. to the U.S., the European Commission adopted the adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (the “Framework”), which permits personal data to flow from the E.U. to U.S. companies participating in the Framework. Similarly, the U.K. government adopted an adequacy decision for the U.S., the UK-US Data Bridge, which permits personal data to flow from the U.K. to U.S. companies participating in the Framework and the U.K. Extension. Such evolving requirements could cause the Company to incur additional costs, require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services.\nIn Australia, the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“AU Privacy Act”) and associated Australian Privacy Principles (“APPs”) impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring organizations to take reasonable steps to ensure that overseas recipients do not breach the APPs in relation to personal data, placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting. The Australian government passed the Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2024 in November 2024 implementing the first tranche of legislative amendments to the AU Privacy Act following the completion of a review of the country’s privacy regime initiated in 2020. These amendments include a mandate for the Australian privacy regulator to develop and register a privacy code for children by December 2026 and new transparency requirements for automated decision making that will apply from December 2026. However, the amendments did not address many of the recommendations made as part of the review, and the government has indicated it intends to implement subsequent amendments to introduce further reforms that will expand the scope of Australia’s current data privacy regime to more closely align with other international regimes such as the GDPR.\nIndustry participants in the U.S., Europe and Australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the Company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior.\nThe interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain and evolving in the U.S. and internationally. Moreover, data privacy and security laws vary between local, state, federal and international jurisdictions and may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The Company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the Company’s data privacy and security compliance programs.\nU.K. Press-Related Regulation\nAs a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press, a Press Recognition Panel (the “PRP”) responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established. Once approved by the PRP, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. In addition to the PRP, certain legislation provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator at the time of events giving rise to a claim may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages were not previously awarded.\nPress regulator IMPRESS was recognized as an approved regulator by the PRP in October 2016. However, publications representing the majority of the industry in the U.K., including News UK, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, or IPSO, in September 2014. IPSO currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the PRP. IPSO has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. IPSO oversees the Editors’ Code of Practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the Editors’ Code of Practice and levy fines of up to £1 million. The burdens IPSO imposes on its print media members, including the Company’s newspaper publishing businesses in \n11\nTable of Contents\nthe U.K., may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance.\nIn addition to the regulations discussed above, the U.K.’s recently enacted Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 empowers the Secretary of State for the U.K. to prevent foreign powers, including foreign states, state-owned investors and associated individuals, from gaining control, influence or greater influence over U.K. newspaper enterprises through the direct or indirect ownership of shares or voting control. The impact of these regulations remains unclear and may result in, among other things, reduced investment in the U.K. newspaper industry.\nU.K. Radio Broadcasting and On-Demand Services Regulation\nThe Company’s radio stations in the U.K. and Ireland and its streaming channel Talk are subject to the U.K.’s Communications Act 2003 and the related Broadcasting Code (together the “U.K. Broadcast and On-Demand Regulations”), which are administered by the Office of Communications (“Ofcom”), the regulatory body for broadcasting and on-demand services in the U.K. The Company is required, among other things, to obtain and maintain licenses to operate its radio stations and to comply with the content standards and other requirements of the U.K. Broadcast and On-Demand Regulations. Although the Company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Non-compliance by the Company with the requirements associated with such licenses, the U.K. Broadcast and On-Demand Regulations or other applicable laws and regulations, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company’s intellectual property assets include: copyrights in its digital and print newspapers, books and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights, including the trademark license for the Realtor.com\n®\n website address, as well as the REALTOR\n®\n trademark (the “NAR License”). In addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. The Company derives value and revenue from its intellectual property assets through, among other things, digital and print newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services, the operation of websites and other digital properties and the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books.\nThe Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and other jurisdictions. To protect these assets, the Company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws, contract provisions and technological protections. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Unauthorized use, including in the digital environment and as a result of recent advances in AI, particularly generative AI, presents a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. Policing unauthorized use of the Company’s products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult, and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Company’s intellectual property. For example, the Company seeks to prevent unauthorized exploitation of its content and other intellectual property by generative AI tools through paywalls, bot management and AI crawler blocking tools, opt-out directives and other means, but these measures may not be effective, particularly if AI operators do not adhere to the restrictions. The Company also seeks to limit unauthorized use of its intellectual property by pursuing legal remedies to enforce its intellectual property rights, advocating for appropriate technical standards and legal frameworks, on its own and through industry groups, and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. However, the application of existing laws and regulations to new technologies, including generative AI, continues to be unsettled and is changing rapidly, and laws and regulations may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Effective intellectual property protection may also be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Therefore, the Company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to support the appropriate evolution, and effective enforcement, of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement.\nThird parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Company’s intellectual property from time to time and claim the protection of legal defenses and/or exceptions to intellectual property laws, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations.\n12\nTable of Contents\nRaw Materials\nAs a major publisher of newspapers, magazines and books, the Company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. In order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the Company’s paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. The Company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate.\nHuman Capital\nNews Corp’s workforce is critical to the creation and delivery of its premium and trusted content and a key contributor to the success of the Company. The Company believes that having a workforce with varied experiences, abilities, backgrounds and perspectives strengthens its ability to create brands, content and products that educate and resonate with its customers and audiences around the world. The Company’s ability to attract, develop, retain and engage talented employees with the skills and capabilities needed by its businesses is an essential component of its long-term business strategy to become more global and more digital, and the capabilities of the Company’s workforce have continued to evolve along with its business and strategy. Key focus areas of the Company’s human capital management strategy are described below, and additional information can be found in its Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Report, available on the Company’s website (which is not incorporated by reference herein). The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for assisting the Board in reviewing and assessing the Company’s risks, opportunities, strategies and policies related to human capital management.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had approximately 22,300 employees, of whom approximately 7,900 were located in the U.S., 3,900 were located in the U.K. and 5,800 were located in Australia. Of the Company’s employees, approximately 3,500 were represented by various employee unions. The contracts with such unions will expire at various times over the next several years. The Company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good.\nCulture and Values\nThe delivery of quality news, information and entertainment to customers and audiences is a passionate, principled and purposeful enterprise. The Company believes people around the globe turn to News Corp because they trust its dedication to those values and to conducting business with integrity. The Company is always mindful that one of its greatest assets is its reputation, and ethical conduct is part of the vision, strategy and fabric of the Company. The Company has established a Compliance Steering Committee that oversees the Company’s global compliance-related policies, protocols and guidance and reports directly to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee. Performance on ethics and compliance is evaluated in determining whether any reduction to the payout of incentive compensation for executive officers is warranted. In addition, all employees are required to regularly complete training on, and affirm compliance with, News Corp’s Standards of Business Conduct, which set forth the Company’s policy to act respectfully in the workplace, do business ethically and comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and are designed to promote a culture of compliance and legal and ethical awareness throughout the Company. The Standards of Business Conduct are reviewed regularly and approved by the Board of Directors and are complemented by business-unit and topic-specific policies and trainings, including with respect to workplace conduct, conflicts of interest, anti-corruption and anti-bribery and insider trading.\nHealth, Safety, Security and Wellbeing\n \nThe health, safety, security and wellbeing of the Company’s employees is a top priority of the Company’s human capital management strategy. The Company’s programs and policies are benchmarked against industry best practices and are designed to be dynamic and account for the changing risks and circumstances facing its employees. Employee wellbeing initiatives engage and support employees with targeted programs for mental and physical health. The Company’s health and safety management systems are designed to comply with local and international environmental, health and safety standards and regulatory requirements. Its physical security infrastructure is designed to address risks related to the workplace, employee travel, business operations, corporate events and the unique requirements of the newsroom and news gathering operations, including through its Global Security Operations Center, which supports key international assignments and incident management. For example, the Company provides safety and security support, around-the-clock monitoring and the application of dynamic risk assessments and oversight for its staff and partners in high-risk areas, enabling the continuation of critical reporting from those regions. \nCompensation and Benefits\nNews Corp’s compensation and benefits programs, which vary based on business unit and geographic location, are focused on attracting, retaining and motivating its employees and reflecting the needs and priorities of its global workforce. In addition to competitive salaries, the Company and its businesses have established short- and long-term incentive programs designed to \n13\nTable of Contents\nmotivate and reward performance against key business objectives and facilitate retention. News Corp also provides a range of retirement and other benefit options to meet the needs of its employees, including healthcare benefits and other programs to address physical, mental and emotional well-being, tax-advantaged savings vehicles, financial education, life and disability insurance, paid time off, flexible work arrangements, generous parental leave policies and other caregiving support, a company match for charitable donations and volunteer time.\nTraining, Development and Engagement\nNews Corp invests in training and development programs designed to enable its employees to develop the skills and leadership abilities necessary to execute on the Company’s strategy and engage and retain top talent. The Company provides compelling on-the-job learning experiences for its people, encouraging employees to test new ideas and expand their capabilities. It offers workshops, webinars and classes on a variety of topics, job-specific training and other continuing education resources. The Company further supports and develops its employees through career planning resources and programs and internal career mobility opportunities that build and strengthen employee versatility and leadership skills. In addition, the Company and its businesses have implemented programs to support regular performance reviews for employees to highlight their strengths and identify the skills and growth necessary to advance their careers. These programs help the Company develop and invest in the next generation of leadership and represent an important component of its talent pipeline strategy. The Company and its businesses periodically conduct employee engagement surveys or focus groups to better understand the experience, concerns and sentiments of employees and to assess progress on Company workforce initiatives.\nExplanatory Note Regarding Certain Metrics\nCertain\n of the Company’s metrics such as subscriptions and unique users are calculated using third-party or internal company data that have not been independently verified. While these numbers are based on what the Company believes to be reasonable calculations for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring such information. \nThe Company’s calculation of certain metrics may also differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly-titled metrics of its competitors due to differences in methodology, and the Company’s methodologies may be updated from time to time. Additional information regarding the calculation of certain metrics is provided below.\nUnique Users\nFor purposes of this Annual Report, unique users and unique visitors, as applicable, are counted only the first time an individual accesses a product’s website using a browser during a calendar month and the first time an individual accesses a product’s mobile app using a mobile device during a calendar month. If the user accesses more than one of a product’s desktop websites, mobile websites and/or mobile apps, the first access to each such website or app is counted as a separate unique user. Users accessing a product’s websites through different browsers, users who clear their browser cache at any time and users who access a product’s websites and apps through different devices are also counted as separate unique users. For a group of products such as WSJDN, a user accessing different products within the group is counted as a separate unique user for each product accessed.\nTotal Digital Revenues\nFor purposes of this Annual Report, the Company defines total digital revenues as the sum of consolidated Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues, digital advertising revenues, digital circulation and subscription revenues, revenues from digital book sales and other miscellaneous digital revenue streams.",

HarperCollins owns more than 120 branded publishing imprints, including Harper, William Morrow, Mariner, HarperCollins Children’s Books, Avon, Harlequin and Christian publishers Zondervan and Thomas Nelson, and publishes works by well-known authors such as Harper Lee, George Orwell, Agatha Christie and Zora Neale Hurston, as well as global author brands including J.R.R.

Revenue from the Dow Jones segment’s consumer business is derived primarily from circulation, which includes subscription and single-copy sales of its digital and print consumer products, the sale of digital and print advertising, licensing fees for its print and digital consumer content and participation fees for its live journalism events. Circulation revenues are dependent on the content of the Dow Jones segment’s consumer products, prices of its and/or competitors’ products, the usefulness and popularity of its digital products, as well as promotional activities and news cycles. Advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including demand for the Dow Jones segment’s consumer products, general economic and business conditions, demographics of the customer base, advertising rates and effectiveness and brand strength and reputation. Advertising revenues are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically highest in the Company’s second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season. In addition, the consumer print business faces challenges from alternative media formats and shifting consumer preferences, which have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, both print circulation and advertising revenues. Advertising, in particular, has been impacted by the shift in spending from print to digital, which has increased advertising choices and formats, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition. Technologies, standards, regulations, policies and practices have also been and will continue to be developed and implemented that make it more difficult to target and measure the effectiveness of digital advertising, which may impact rates or revenues. As a multi-platform news provider, the Dow Jones segment seeks to maximize revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, including leveraging its content through licensing arrangements with third-party platforms, developing new advertising models and growing its live journalism events business, and continues to invest in its digital and other products, which represent an increasingly larger share of revenues at its consumer business. Mobile devices and apps and other technologies provide continued opportunities for the Dow Jones segment to make its content available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes and develop its products to continue to attract advertisers and/or affect the relationship between content providers and consumers. Unauthorized use, including in the digital environment and as a result of recent advances in artificial intelligence (“AI”), particularly generative AI, presents a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. Additionally, the application of existing laws and regulations to new technologies, including generative AI, continues to be unsettled and is changing rapidly, and laws and regulations may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nThe Dow Jones segment’s consumer products compete for consumers, audience and advertising with other local and national newspapers, web and app-based media, news aggregators, customized news feeds, search engines, blogs, magazines, investment tools, social media sources, podcasts and event producers, as well as other media such as television, radio stations and outdoor displays. As a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies (including developments in AI, particularly generative AI), distribution platforms and business models, and corresponding changes in consumer behavior, the consumer business continues to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue, including from a variety of alternative news and information sources, programmatic advertising buying channels and AI aggregators and other emerging technology platforms.\nOperating expenses for the consumer business include costs related to paper, production, distribution, third-party printing, editorial and commissions. Selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. The costs associated with printing and distributing newspapers, including paper prices and delivery costs, are key operating expenses whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the results of the Dow Jones segment’s consumer business. The consumer business is affected by the cyclical changes in the price of paper and other factors that may affect paper prices, including, among other things, inflation, supply chain disruptions, industry trends or economics and tariffs or other trade restrictions. In addition, the Dow Jones segment relies on third parties for much of the printing and distribution of its print products. The shift from print to digital and changing labor markets present challenges to the financial and operational stability of these third parties which could, in turn, impact the availability, or increase the cost, of third-party printing and distribution services for the Company’s newspapers. \nThe Dow Jones segment’s professional information business, which targets enterprise customers, derives revenue primarily from subscriptions to its professional information products. The professional information business serves enterprise customers with products that combine news and information with technology and tools that inform decisions and aid awareness, research, understanding and compliance. The success of the professional information business depends on its ability to provide products, services, applications and functionalities that meet the needs of its enterprise customers, who operate in information-intensive and oftentimes highly regulated industries such as finance and insurance, and it must also anticipate and respond to industry trends and regulatory and technological changes.\nSignificant expenses for the professional information business include development costs, sales and marketing expenses, hosting and support services, royalties, salaries, consulting and professional fees, sales commissions, employee benefits and other routine overhead expenses.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThe Dow Jones segment’s professional information products compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers, global financial newswires and energy and commodities pricing and data providers, including Reuters News, RELX (including LexisNexis and ICIS), Refinitiv, S&P Global, DTN and Argus Media, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data. The professional information business also faces increasing competition from a variety of AI-powered platforms and services.\nDigital Real Estate Services\nThe Digital Real Estate Services segment generates revenue through property and property-related advertising and services, including: the sale of real estate listing and lead generation products and referral-based services to agents, brokers, developers, homebuilders and landlords; real estate-related and property rental-related services; display advertising on residential real estate and commercial property sites; and residential property data services to the financial sector. The Digital Real Estate Services segment also generates revenue through commissions from referrals generated through its digital property search and financing offering and mortgage broking services. Significant expenses associated with these sites and services include development costs, advertising and promotional expenses, hosting and support services, salaries, broker commissions, employee benefits and other routine overhead expenses. The Digital Real Estate Services segment’s results are highly sensitive to conditions in the real estate market, as well as macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and inflation, which are expected to continue to adversely impact real estate lead and transaction volumes and adjacent businesses in the near term, particularly in the U.S.\nConsumers overwhelmingly turn to the internet and mobile devices for real estate information and services. The Digital Real Estate Services segment’s success depends on its continued innovation to provide products and services that are useful for consumers and real estate, mortgage and financial services professionals, homebuilders and landlords and attractive to its advertisers. The Digital Real Estate Services segment operates in a highly competitive digital environment with other operators of real estate and property websites and mobile apps.\nBook Publishing\nThe Book Publishing segment derives revenues from the sale and licensing of general fiction, nonfiction, children’s and religious books in the U.S. and internationally. The revenues and operating results of the Book Publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of its books in the marketplace. The book publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. This marketplace is highly competitive and continues to change due to technological developments, including additional digital platforms and distribution channels such as streaming audiobooks, and other factors. Each book is a separate and distinct product and its financial success depends upon many factors, including public acceptance.\nMajor new title releases represent a significant portion of the Book Publishing segment’s sales throughout the fiscal year. Print-based consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Book Publishing segment is subject to global trends and local economic conditions. Recent economic uncertainty and lower consumer confidence have contributed to softer consumer spending within the U.S. book publishing industry, which may continue in the near term. Operating expenses for the Book Publishing segment include costs related to paper, printing, freight, authors’ royalties, editorial, promotional, art and design expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead costs.\nNews Media\nRevenue at the News Media segment is derived primarily from circulation and subscriptions, the sale of advertising and licensing fees. Circulation and subscription revenues can be greatly affected by changes in the prices of the Company’s and/or competitors’ products, as well as by promotional activities and news cycles. Adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising have affected, and may continue to affect, revenues. Advertising revenues at the News Media segment are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically being highest in the Company’s second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies.\nOperating expenses include costs related to paper, production, distribution, editorial, commissions, technology and radio sports rights. Selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. The cost of paper is a key operating expense whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the results of the segment. The News Media segment’s expenses are affected by the cyclical changes in the price of paper and other factors that may affect paper prices, including, among other things, inflation, supply chain disruptions, industry trends or economics (including the closure or conversion of newsprint mills and consolidation among suppliers) and tariffs or other trade restrictions.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe News Media segment’s products compete for readership, audience and advertising with local and national competitors and also compete with other media alternatives in their respective markets. Competition for circulation and subscriptions is based on the content of the products provided, pricing and, from time to time, various promotions. The success of these products also depends upon advertisers’ judgments as to the most effective use of their advertising budgets. Competition for advertising is based upon product reach and engagement, advertising rates, advertiser results, availability of alternative media and quality of consumer demographics. Large digital platforms command a substantial share of the digital advertising market and are also responsible for a significant amount of traffic to the News Media segment’s digital properties, which drives advertiser spending. Visibility on these platforms depends on algorithms that are outside the Company’s control and change frequently, and recent changes have adversely affected traffic to some of the digital properties in the News Media segment, particularly in the U.K. As a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies (including developments in AI, particularly generative AI), distribution platforms and business models, and corresponding changes in consumer behavior, the News Media segment continues to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue. Advertising, in particular, has been impacted by the shift in spending from print to digital, which has increased advertising choices and formats, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition. Technologies, standards, regulations, policies and practices have been and will continue to be developed and implemented that make it more difficult to target and measure the effectiveness of digital advertising, which may impact rates or revenues.\nAs multi-platform news providers, the businesses within the News Media segment seek to maximize revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, including leveraging their content through licensing arrangements with third-party platforms and developing new advertising models, and continue to invest in their digital products. Mobile devices and apps and other technologies provide continued opportunities for the businesses within the News Media segment to make their content available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes and develop their products to continue to attract advertisers and/or affect the relationship between content providers and consumers. Unauthorized use, including in the digital environment and as a result of recent advances in AI, particularly generative AI, presents a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. Additionally, the application of existing laws and regulations to new technologies, including generative AI, continues to be unsettled and is changing rapidly, and laws and regulations may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nOther\nThe Other segment primarily consists of general corporate overhead expenses, strategy costs and costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters.\nOther Business Developments\nSale of Foxtel Group\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Foxtel Group (“Foxtel”) to DAZN Group Limited (“DAZN”), a global sports streaming platform, and the transaction closed in April 2025.\nThe assets and liabilities, results of operations and cash flows for Foxtel have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented as the disposition reflects a strategic shift that has, and will have, a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. Furthermore, upon reclassification of Foxtel’s results, the Subscription Video Services segment ceased to be a reportable segment and the residual results of the segment were aggregated into the News Media segment. News Media segment results have been recast to reflect this change for all periods presented. See Note 3—Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. \nRecent Developments Affecting the Macroeconomic Environment\nRecent changes in trade policy, including new or potential tariffs and other trade restrictions announced by the U.S. and other countries, have led to significant economic and market volatility and uncertainty and may exacerbate inflationary pressures. While the Company does not currently expect the announced tariffs to have a material impact on its supply chain or costs, it cannot predict the effect of any further changes in trade policy. The resulting volatility and uncertainty and potential increase in inflation may continue to have a negative impact on customer and consumer sentiment and spending. If this leads to reduced demand for the Company’s products and services, it could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company will continue to closely monitor these trends and uncertainties and will seek to mitigate any impacts where possible.\n37\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations—Fiscal 2025 versus Fiscal 2024\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s operating results for fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024.\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues:\nCirculation and subscription\n$\n3,009 \n$\n2,909 \n$\n100 \n3 \n%\nAdvertising\n1,367 \n1,400 \n(33)\n(2)\n%\nConsumer\n2,047 \n2,000 \n47 \n2 \n%\nReal estate\n1,410 \n1,284 \n126 \n10 \n%\nOther\n619 \n659 \n(40)\n(6)\n%\nTotal Revenues\n8,452 \n8,252 \n200 \n2 \n%\nOperating expenses\n(3,736)\n(3,814)\n78 \n2 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n(3,301)\n(3,197)\n(104)\n(3)\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n(459)\n(440)\n(19)\n(4)\n%\nImpairment and restructuring charges\n(132)\n(133)\n1 \n1 \n%\nEquity losses of affiliates\n(15)\n(6)\n(9)\n(150)\n%\nInterest income (expense), net\n3 \n(18)\n21 \n**\nOther, net\n111 \n(59)\n170 \n**\nIncome before income tax expense from continuing operations\n923\n \n585\n \n338\n \n58\n \n%\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations\n(275)\n(206)\n(69)\n(33)\n%\nNet income from continuing operations\n648 \n379 \n269 \n71 \n%\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n692 \n(25)\n717 \n**\nNet income\n1,340 \n354 \n986 \n279 \n%\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations\n(168)\n(110)\n(58)\n(53)\n%\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests from discontinued operations\n8 \n22 \n(14)\n(64)\n%\nNet income attributable to News Corporation stockholders\n$\n1,180\n \n$\n266\n \n$\n914\n \n344\n \n%\n** not meaningful\nRevenues\n—Revenues increased $200 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. The increase\n was\n due to higher revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment driven by higher Australian residential revenues at REA Group, at the Dow Jones segment driven by higher circulation and subscription revenues and at the Book Publishing segment driven by higher digital book sales and improved returns in the U.S., partially offset by lower revenues at the News Media segment driven by the transfer of third-party printing revenue contracts to News UK’s joint venture with DMG Media in fiscal 2024, lower advertising revenues and lower circulation and subscription revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024.\nThe Company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period.\nOperating expenses\n—Operating expenses decreased $78 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. The decrease in operating expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was primarily due to lower expenses at the News Media segment driven by cost savings from the combination of News UK’s printing operations with those of DMG Media and other cost savings initiatives. The decrease was partially offset by increased expenses at the Dow Jones segment driven by higher employee costs. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in an Operating expense increase of $9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024.\n38\nTable of Contents\nSelling, general and administrative\n—Selling, general and administrative increased $104 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. The increase in Selling, \ngeneral and administrative for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025\n was primarily due to higher expenses at the Digital Real Estate Services segment driven by higher employee costs at REA Group, $12 million of costs related to REA Group’s withdrawn offer to acquire Rightmove and higher costs from REA India, at the Book Publishing segment due to higher employee costs and costs from recent acquisitions and at the Dow Jones segment driven by higher marketing and technology costs.\nDepreciation and amortization\n—Depreciation and amortization expense increased $19 million, or 4%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. The increase was driven by higher depreciation of capitalized software costs, primarily at the Digital Real Estate Services and News Media segments.\nImpairment and restructuring charges\n—During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $120 million and $89 million, respectively. See Note 5—Restructuring Programs in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $44 million, primarily related to the write-down of fixed assets at the News Media segment associated with the combination of News UK’s printing operations with those of DMG Media. See Note 7—Property, Plant and Equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEquity losses of affiliates\n—Equity losses of affiliates worsened by $9 million, or 150%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. See Note 6—Investments in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest income (expense), net\n—Interest income (expense), net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 improved by $21 million as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily driven by lower borrowings at REA Group and higher interest income on cash balances. See Note 9—Borrowings and Note 11—Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOther, net\n—For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company recorded Other, net of $111 million, which was mainly comprised of REA Group’s gain recognized on the sale of its interest in PropertyGuru. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded Other, net of $(59) million. See Note 21—Additional Financial Information in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations\n—For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company recorded income tax expense of $275 million on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $923 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30%, which was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates and valuation allowances recorded against tax benefits in certain businesses offset by lower taxes on the disposition of REA Group’s interest in PropertyGuru.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of $206 million on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $585 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 35%, which was higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates, asset impairments and investment write-downs with lower tax benefits and valuation allowances recorded against tax benefits in certain businesses. See Note 19—Income Taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn July 4, 2025, H.R. 1 - One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted into law. The OBBBA makes permanent key elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), including 100% bonus depreciation, domestic research cost expensing, and the business interest expense limitation. Certain provisions of OBBBA will become effective for the Company’s 2026 fiscal year, while others will take effect beginning in fiscal 2027. ASC 740, \nIncome Taxes\n, requires the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances to be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. Consequently, the Company will evaluate all U.S. deferred tax balances and any other impacts to its financial statements as a result of the OBBBA in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\n39\nTable of Contents\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of reported profits (“Pillar 2”) that has been agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries. Since the proposal, many countries, including the UK and Australia, incorporated Pillar 2 model rule concepts into their domestic laws. Although the model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar 2 slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines and may adjust domestic tax incentives in response to Pillar 2. Following an executive order issued by the United States in January 2025 announcing opposition to aspects of these rules, the G7 issued a statement on June 28, 2025 acknowledging that U.S. parented groups would be exempt from certain aspects of Pillar 2 in recognition of existing U.S. minimum tax rules to which they are subject. The statement acknowledges that these issues have relevance to the wider group of countries in the OECD Inclusive Framework with a view to reaching an acceptable solution for all.\nWhile these rules are not currently expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, their application continues to evolve, and the outcome may alter aspects of how the Company’s tax obligations are determined in countries in which it does business. In addition, while several jurisdictions have rolled back their digital services taxes, certain jurisdictions continue to maintain, or have enacted new digital services taxes. Those taxes have had limited impact on the Company’s overall tax obligations, but the Company continues to monitor them.\nNet income from continuing operations\n—Net income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was $648 million as compared to $379 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $269 million, or 71%, as compared to fiscal 2024, driven by the factors discussed above.\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\n—Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was $692 million compared to $(25) million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The amounts recognized in both fiscal years relate to the reclassification of Foxtel to discontinued operations. See Note 3—Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet income\n—Net income was $1,340 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, as compared to $354 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $986 million, or 279%, primarily driven by the factors discussed above.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations\n—Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations was $168 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, as compared to $110 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $58 million, or 53%, primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of the PropertyGuru investment and higher earnings at REA Group.\nSegment Analysis\nThe Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. Segment EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources within, the Company’s businesses. Segment EBITDA is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest (expense) income, net, other, net, income tax (expense) benefit and net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the Company’s business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors’ data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).\n40\nTable of Contents\nTotal Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss) from continuing operations, cash flow from continuing operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance. The Company believes that the presentation of Total Segment EBITDA provides useful information regarding the Company’s operations and other factors that affect the Company’s reported results. Specifically, the Company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the Company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the Company believes are not representative of its core business. As a result, users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the Company across different periods. \nThe following table reconciles Net income from continuing operations to Total Segment EBITDA for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024:\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nNet income from continuing operations\n$\n648 \n$\n379 \nReconciling items:\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations\n275 \n206 \nOther, net\n(111)\n59 \nInterest (income) expense, net\n(3)\n18 \nEquity losses of affiliates\n15 \n6 \nImpairment and restructuring charges\n132 \n133 \nDepreciation and amortization\n459 \n440 \nTotal Segment EBITDA\n$\n1,415\n \n$\n1,241\n \nThe following table sets forth the Company’s Revenues and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024:\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nRevenues\nSegment\nEBITDA\nRevenues\nSegment\nEBITDA\nDow Jones\n$\n2,331 \n$\n588 \n$\n2,231 \n$\n542 \nDigital Real Estate Services\n1,802 \n601 \n1,658 \n508 \nBook Publishing\n2,149 \n296 \n2,093 \n269 \nNews Media\n2,170 \n153 \n2,270 \n133 \nOther\n— \n(223)\n— \n(211)\nTotal\n$\n8,452\n \n$\n1,415\n \n$\n8,252\n \n$\n1,241\n \n41\nTable of Contents\nDow Jones \n(28% and 27% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively)\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues:\nCirculation and subscription\n$\n1,884 \n$\n1,771 \n$\n113 \n6 \n%\nAdvertising\n396 \n405 \n(9)\n(2)\n%\nOther\n51 \n55 \n(4)\n(7)\n%\nTotal Revenues\n2,331\n \n2,231\n \n100\n \n4\n \n%\nOperating expenses\n(958)\n(919)\n(39)\n(4)\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n(785)\n(770)\n(15)\n(2)\n%\nSegment EBITDA\n$\n588\n \n$\n542\n \n$\n46\n \n8\n \n%\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, revenues at the Dow Jones segment increased $100 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2024, due to higher circulation and subscription revenues.

Circulation and other revenues increased $54 million, or 6%, driven by increased circulation revenues due to growth in digital-only subscriptions, which benefited from bundled offers, the conversion of customers from introductory promotions to higher pricing and higher content licensing revenues, partially offset by print circulation declines.

Revenues at REA Group increased $136 million, or 12%, to $1,250 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 from $1,114 million in fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher Australian residential revenues driven by price increases, increased depth penetration and growth in national listings and higher revenues from REA India, partially offset by the $14 million, or 1%, negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Revenues at Move increased $8 million, or 1%, to $552 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 from $544 million in fiscal 2024, driven by revenue growth in seller, new homes and rentals, including the partnership with Zillow, higher sales of RealPRO Select\nSM\n (formerly Market VIP\nSM\n), as Move shifts its focus to more premium offerings, and higher advertising revenues. The increases were largely offset by the continued negative impact of the macroeconomic environment on the U.S. housing market, including higher interest rates, which resulted in a 9% decline in lead volumes and lower transaction volumes.\nFor the fiscal year ended \nJune 30, 2025\n, Segment EBITDA at the Digital Real Estate Services segmen\nt increased $93 million, or 18%\n, as compared to fiscal \n2024, primarily due to the higher revenues discussed above, partially offset by higher employee costs at REA Group, $12 million of costs related to the withdrawn offer to acquire Rightmove in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, higher costs from REA India and the $6 million, or 1%, negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nBook Publishing\n (25% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in both fiscal 2025 and 2024)\n \nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues:\nConsumer\n$\n2,047 \n$\n2,000 \n$\n47 \n2 \n%\nOther\n102 \n93 \n9 \n10 \n%\nTotal Revenues\n2,149\n \n2,093\n \n56\n \n3\n \n%\nOperating expenses\n(1,450)\n(1,441)\n(9)\n(1)\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n(403)\n(383)\n(20)\n(5)\n%\nSegment EBITDA\n$\n296\n \n$\n269\n \n$\n27\n \n10\n \n%\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, revenues at the Book Publishing segment increased $56 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher digital book sales, improved returns in the U.S. and the $14 million impact from the acquisition of a German book publisher. Digital sales increased by 5% as compared to fiscal 2024 driven by continued market growth in audiobooks, including the contribution from the Spotify partnership, as well as growth in e-book sales. Digital sales represented approximately 24% of consumer revenues in fiscal 2025 as compared to 23% in fiscal 2024. Backlist sales represented approximately 64% of consumer revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, as compared to 61% in fiscal 2024. \nThe impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resu\nlted in a revenue increase of $4 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, Segment EBITDA at the Book Publishing segment increased $27 million, or 10%, as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to the higher revenues discussed above, partially offset by higher employee costs and costs from recent acquisitions.\nNews Media\n (26% and 28% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively)\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\nChange\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues:\nCirculation and subscription\n$\n1,118 \n$\n1,128 \n$\n(10)\n(1)\n%\nAdvertising\n820 \n859 \n(39)\n(5)\n%\nOther\n232 \n283 \n(51)\n(18)\n%\nTotal Revenues\n2,170\n \n2,270\n \n(100)\n(4)\n%\nOperating expenses\n(1,142)\n(1,264)\n122 \n10 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n(875)\n(873)\n(2)\n— \n%\nSegment EBITDA\n$\n153\n \n$\n133\n \n$\n20\n \n15\n \n%\n44\nTable of Contents\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, revenues at the News Media segment decreased $100 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2024.

Advertising revenues decreased $39 million, or 5%, as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to lower print advertising revenues at News Corp Australia \nand lower\n digital advertising revenues at News UK, driven by a decline in traffic, mainly at\n The Sun\n, due to algorithm changes at certain platforms, partially offset by higher advertising revenues at Wireless Group and the $5 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased $10 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily driven by print volume declines, partially offset by cover price increases, higher content licensing revenues at News UK, digital subscriber growth and the $9 million, or 1%, positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $14 million, or 1%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, Segment EBITDA at the News Media segment increased $20 million, or 15%, as compared to fiscal 2024. The increase was driven by cost savings initiatives, including lower Talk costs and the combination of News UK’s printing operations with those of DMG Media, partially offset by the decrease in revenues discussed above.\nNews Corp Australia\nRevenues were $895 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, a decrease of $34 million, or 4%, as compared to fiscal 2024 revenues of $929 million. Advertising revenues decreased $23 million, or 6%, due to lower print advertising revenues. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased $14 million, or 3%, driven by print volume declines and lower content licensing revenues, partially offset by cover price increases and digital subscriber growth.

Other revenues decreased $54 million, or 55%, driven by the transfer of third-party printing revenue contracts to News UK’s joint venture with DMG Media in fiscal 2024. Advertising revenues decreased $22 million, or 8%, primarily due to lower digital advertising revenues, mainly at \nThe Sun\n, driven by algorithm changes at certain platforms and lower print advertising revenues.\n \nCirculation and subscription revenues increased $9 million, or 2%, due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations as cover price increases, higher content licensing revenues and digital subscriber growth were more than offset by print volume declines. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $22 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCurrent Financial Condition\nThe Company’s principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of June 30, 2025, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were $2.4 billion. The Company also has available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) and certain other facilities, as described below, and expects to have access to the worldwide credit and capital markets, subject to market conditions, in order to issue additional debt if needed or desired. The Company currently expects these elements of liquidity will enable it to meet its liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months, including repayment of indebtedness. Although the Company believes that its cash on hand and future cash from operations, together with its access to the credit and capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for at least the next twelve months, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) the financial and operational performance of the Company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (ii) the Company’s credit ratings and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (iii) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents; (iv) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets; and (v) the state of the economy. There can be no assurances that the Company will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms.\n45\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company’s consolidated assets included $915 million in cash and cash equivalents that were held by its foreign subsidiaries. Of this amount, $280 million is cash not readily accessible by the Company as it is held by REA Group, a majority owned but separately listed public company. REA Group must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Group’s cash balance. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the Company’s undistributed foreign earnings were considered permanently reinvested and as such, United States federal and state income taxes were not previously recorded on these earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, substantially all of the Company’s earnings in foreign subsidiaries generated prior to the enactment of the Tax Act were deemed to have been repatriated and taxed accordingly. As of June 30, 2025, the Company has approximately $1 billion of undistributed foreign earnings generated after the Tax Act that it intends to reinvest permanently. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if these earnings were repatriated. The Company may repatriate future earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in which case the Company may be required to accrue and pay additional taxes, including any applicable foreign withholding taxes and income taxes.\nThe principal uses of cash that affect the Company’s liquidity position include the following: operational expenditures including employee costs and paper purchases; capital expenditures; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; acquisitions; the repurchase of shares; dividends; and the repayment of debt and related interest. In addition to the acquisitions and dispositions disclosed elsewhere, as applicable, the Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible future acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the issuance of the Company’s securities or the assumption of indebtedness.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn September 22, 2021, the Company announced a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $1 billion in the aggregate of the Company’s outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (the “2021 Repurchase Program”). As of June 30, 2025, the remaining authorized amount under the 2021 Repurchase Program was approximately $310 million.\nStock repurchases under the 2021 Repurchase Program commenced on November 9, 2021. The following table summarizes the shares repurchased and subsequently retired and the related consideration paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024: \nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\nShares \nAmount\nShares \nAmount\n(in millions)\nClass A Common Stock\n3.5 \n$\n97 \n3.4 \n$\n79 \nClass B Common Stock\n1.8 \n53 \n1.6 \n38 \nTotal\n5.3 \n$\n150 \n5.0 \n$\n117 \nOn July 15, 2025, the Company announced a new stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $1 billion in the aggregate of the Company’s outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (the “2025 Repurchase Program” and, together with the 2021 Repurchase Program, the “Stock Repurchase Programs”), which is in addition to the remaining authorized amount under the 2021 Repurchase Program.\nThe manner, timing, number and share price of any repurchases under the Stock Repurchase Programs will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend upon such factors as the market price of the stock, general market conditions, applicable securities laws, alternative investment opportunities and other factors. The Stock Repurchase Programs have no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.\nDividends\nThe following table summarizes the dividends declared and paid per share on both the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock:\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\nCash dividends paid per share\n$\n0.20 \n$\n0.20 \n46\nTable of Contents\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, is within the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”). The Board of Directors’ decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant.\nSources and Uses of Cash—Fiscal 2025 versus Fiscal 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations\n for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 was as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations\n$\n978 \n$\n897 \nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by $81 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher Total Segment EBITDA and lower restructuring and interest payments, largely offset by higher working capital and higher tax payments.\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations\n for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 was as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations\n$\n(406)\n$\n(410)\nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations decreased $4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024 driven by the $193 million of higher proceeds from sales of investments, primarily REA Group’s interest in PropertyGuru, partially offset by the $58 million increase in cash used for purchases of investments, $58 million increase in net cash used for acquisitions and $50 million increase in capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations\n for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 was as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations\n$\n(524)\n$\n(483)\nNet cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $524 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to $483 million for fiscal 2024. \nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company had $203 million of borrowing repayments, primarily related to REA Group, dividend payments of $185 million to News Corporation stockholders and REA Group minority stockholders and $150 million of repurchases of outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock under the 2021 Repurchase Program. The net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was partially offset by new borrowings of $61 million at REA Group. \nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company had $409 million of borrowing repayments, primarily related to the refinancing of REA Group’s debt portfolio, dividend payments of $172 million to News Corporation stockholders and REA Group minority stockholders and $117 million of repurchases of outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock under the 2021 Repurchase Program. The net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was partially offset by new borrowings of $278 million primarily related to the refinancing of REA Group’s debt portfolio. See Note 9—Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n47\nTable of Contents\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations\n for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 was as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by discontinued operations\n$\n370 \n$\n129 \nNet cash provided by discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 primarily relates to the sale of Foxtel.\nReconciliation of Free Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations, less capital expenditures. Free cash flow excludes cash flow from discontinued operations. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow.\nFree cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Company’s consolidated Statements of Cash Flows prepared in accordance with GAAP, which incorporates all cash movements during the period. The Company believes free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors about the Company’s liquidity and cash flow trends.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations to free cash flow:\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations\n$\n978 \n$\n897 \nLess: Capital expenditures\n(407)\n(357)\nFree cash flow \n571 \n540 \nFree cash flow in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was $571 million compared to $540 million in fiscal 2024. Free cash flow increased due to higher cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, as discussed above, partially offset by the $50 million increase in capital expenditures.\nBorrowings\nNews Corporation Borrowings\nAs of June 30, 2025, News Corporation had (i) borrowings of $1,962 million, including the current portion, consisting of its outstanding 2021 Senior Notes, 2022 Senior Notes and Term A Loans, and (ii) $750 million of undrawn commitments available under the Revolving Facility. \nREA Group Borrowings\nAs of June 30, 2025, REA Group had A$400 million of undrawn commitments available under the 2024 REA Credit Facility. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, REA Group terminated its (i) A$83 million 2024 Subsidiary Facility and repaid the amount outstanding using capacity available under the 2024 REA Credit Facility and (ii) terminated its A$200 million 2024 REA Credit Facility—tranche 2 and repaid the amount outstanding using proceeds from the sale of REA Group’s interest in PropertyGuru. REA Group is a consolidated but non wholly-owned subsidiary of News Corp, and its indebtedness is only guaranteed by REA Group and certain of its subsidiaries and is non-recourse to News Corp.\nAll of the Company’s borrowings contain customary representations, covenants and events of default. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants at June 30, 2025.\n48\nTable of Contents\nSee Note 9—Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company’s outstanding debt, including additional information about interest rates, amortization (if any), maturities and covenants related to such debt arrangements.\nCommitments\nThe Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the current and future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material firm commitments as of June 30, 2025:\nAs of June 30, 2025\nPayments Due by Period\nLess than 1 year\n1-3 years\n3-5 years\nMore than 5 years\nTotal\n(in millions)\nPurchase obligations\n(a)\n$\n415 \n$\n437 \n$\n88 \n$\n94 \n$\n1,034 \nOperating leases\n(b)\n117 \n208 \n146 \n860 \n1,331 \nBorrowings\n(c)\n25 \n450 \n1,000 \n500 \n1,975 \nInterest payments on borrowings\n(d)\n81 \n144 \n90 \n51 \n366 \nTotal commitments and contractual obligations\n$\n638 \n$\n1,239 \n$\n1,324 \n$\n1,505 \n$\n4,706 \n(a)\nThe Company has commitments under purchase obligations related to technology infrastructure services, marketing agreements, content licensing costs and other legally binding commitments.\n(b)\nThe Company leases office facilities, warehouse facilities, printing plants and equipment. These leases, which are classified as operating leases, are expected to be paid at certain dates through fiscal 2048. Amounts reflected represent only the Company’s lease obligations for which it has firm commitments. \n(c)\nSee Note 9—Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(d)\nReflects the Company’s expected future interest payments based on borrowings outstanding and interest rates applicable at June 30, 2025. Such rates are subject to change in future periods. See Note 9—Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint, ink and plates that require the Company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production. Since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the Company’s total requirements, the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above.\nThe table also excludes the Company’s pension obligations, other postretirement benefits (“OPEB”) obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments. The Company made contributions of $20 million and $23 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, interest rates and statutory requirements. The Company anticipates that it will make required contributions of approximately $1 million in fiscal 2026, assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the Company’s returns in fiscal 2025 and those expected beyond, and that interest rates remain constant. The Company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. Payments due to participants under the Company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. Payments due under the Company’s OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the Company’s OPEB plans. The Company expects its OPEB payments to approximate $7 million in fiscal 2026. See Note 17—Retirement Benefit Obligations and Note 18—Other Postretirement Benefits in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther significant ongoing expenses or cash requirements for each of the Company’s segments are discussed above in “Overview of the Company’s Businesses.” The Company generally expects to fund these short and long-term cash requirements with internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nContingencies\nThe Company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed in Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. Fees, expenses, fines, penalties, \n49\nTable of Contents\njudgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. The Company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable. See Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the Company. See Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nThe Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.\nUnder ASC 350, \nIntangibles—Goodwill and Other \n(“ASC 350”)\n,\n in assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting unit, and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using both a discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation approach.\nDetermining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, long-term growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as part of the Company’s long-range planning process, the Company completed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test.\nThe performance of the Company’s annual impairment analysis resulted in no impairments to indefinite-lived intangible assets or goodwill in fiscal 2025. The Company utilized the qualitative assessment for certain of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The qualitative tests performed considered various factors since the performance of the last quantitative test, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and company-specific trends and parent company share price performance. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method for quantitative assessments were discount rates (generally ranging from 8.0% to 17.0%), long-term growth rates (ranging from 2.0% to 3.0%) and royalty rates (ranging from 0.25% to 5.0%). Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method for quantitative assessments were EBITDA and revenue multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries (ranging from 5.0x to 10.0x and 2.0x to 2.8x, respectively) and control premiums (ranging from 5.0% to 10.0%). Significant increases (decreases) in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, assuming no change in discount rates, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Significant decreases (increases) in discount rates, assuming no changes in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding changes in these inputs and assumptions compared to prior fiscal years.\n50\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under ASC 740, \nIncome Taxes \n(“ASC 740”).\nThe Company’s annual tax rate is based primarily on its geographic income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant management judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets. In assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. The Company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, tax planning and the Company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Although the Company believes its current estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management re-evaluates its tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available. The Company’s policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of Income tax (expense) benefit.\nSee Note 19—Income Taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding these estimates and assumptions and changes compared to prior fiscal years.\nRetirement Benefit Obligations\nThe Company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries. See Note 17—Retirement Benefit Obligations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by GAAP. The measurement and recognition of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the net periodic benefit costs (income) and projected benefit obligation, require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality and other actuarial assumptions. Current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, were considered in making these assumptions. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, the pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return of 6.4% for fiscal 2026 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 10% equities, 86% fixed-income securities and 4% cash and other investments.\nThe Company recorded $10 million and $28 million in net periodic benefit costs (income) in the Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company utilizes the full yield-curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs (income) for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nAlthough the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually, a weighted average discount rate of 5.5% will be used in calculating the fiscal 2026 net periodic benefit costs (income). The discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on the Company’s annual measurement date of June 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The rate was determined by matching the Company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds. The weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date. \n51\nTable of Contents\nThe key assumptions used in developing the Company’s fiscal 2025 and 2024 net periodic benefit costs (income) for its plans consist of the following:\n2025\n2024\n(in millions, except %)\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs (income):\nDiscount rate for PBO\n5.3%\n5.4%\nDiscount rate for service cost\n5.3%\n5.4%\nDiscount rate for interest on PBO\n5.2%\n5.6%\nAssets:\nExpected rate of return\n5.9%\n5.6%\nExpected return\n$51\n$49\nActual return\n$24\n$45\nLoss\n$(27)\n$(4)\nOne year actual return\n2.8%\n5.2%\nFive year actual return\n(2.9)%\n(1.8)%\nThe Company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 6.4% for fiscal 2026 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns. The accumulated net pre-tax losses on the Company’s pension plans as of June 30, 2025 were approximately $456 million which increased from approximately $438 million for the Company’s pension plans as of June 30, 2024. This net increase of $18 million was primarily due to losses on plan assets and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations, the Company’s deferred losses and subsequent-year benefit costs. Higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations, reduce the Company’s accumulated net loss and decrease subsequent-year benefit costs. These deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs (income) in accordance with ASC 715, \nCompensation—Retirement Benefits\n (“ASC 715”). Unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans.\nThe Company made contributions of $20 million and $23 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. Assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the Company’s returns in fiscal 2025 and those expected beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the Company anticipates that it will make required pension contributions of approximately $1 million in fiscal 2026. The Company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. See Note 17—Retirement Benefit Obligations and Note 18—Other Postretirement Benefits in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChanges in net periodic benefit costs (income) may occur in the future due to changes in the Company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. The following table highlights the sensitivity of the Company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:\nChanges in Assumption\nImpact on Annual Pension Expense\nImpact on Projected Benefit Obligation\n0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate\n—\nIncrease $20 million\n0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate\n—\nDecrease $19 million\n0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets\nIncrease $2 million\n—\n0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets\nDecrease $2 million\n—",
