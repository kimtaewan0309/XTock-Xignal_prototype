BUSINESS\nIn December 2024, Old Aptiv (as defined below), a public limited company formed under the laws of Jersey on May 19, 2011, completed its previously announced reorganization transaction (the “Transaction,” or the “reorganization transaction”), in which Old Aptiv established a new publicly-listed Jersey parent company, Aptiv Holdings Limited (“New Aptiv”), which is resident for tax purposes in Switzerland. As a result of the Transaction, all issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Old Aptiv were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for newly issued ordinary shares of New Aptiv. Following consummation of the Transaction, holders of Old Aptiv shares became ordinary shareholders of New Aptiv, Old Aptiv became a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Aptiv and New Aptiv was renamed “Aptiv PLC.” The previous publicly-listed Jersey parent company, which was an Irish tax resident, is referred to as “Old Aptiv” throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. New Aptiv’s ordinary shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “APTV,” the same symbol under which the Old Aptiv shares were previously listed. Aptiv PLC remains a public limited company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, and continues to be subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements.\nIn December 2024, following the completion of the Transaction, Old Aptiv merged with and into Aptiv Swiss Holdings Limited (“Aptiv Swiss Holdings”), a newly formed Jersey incorporated private limited company, and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of New Aptiv, with Aptiv Swiss Holdings surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of New Aptiv, and Old Aptiv ceasing to exist. Except as otherwise noted, all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Old Aptiv vested in Aptiv Swiss Holdings, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Old Aptiv became debts, liabilities and duties of Aptiv Swiss Holdings.\nIn connection with the Transaction, New Aptiv assumed Old Aptiv’s Long-Term Incentive Plans and its existing obligations in connection with awards granted thereunder, and Aptiv Swiss Holdings (i) entered into a supplemental indenture to each indenture in which Aptiv Swiss Holdings assumed all of Old Aptiv’s obligations under each series of Old Aptiv’s outstanding Notes and (ii) entered into an assumption and/or supplement agreement relating to each Credit Agreement in which New Aptiv assumed all of Old Aptiv’s obligations under each Credit Agreement as the “parent entity” thereunder. In addition, New Aptiv (i) entered into a supplemental indenture to each indenture in which New Aptiv guaranteed the outstanding Notes and (ii) entered into a guarantee joinder relating to each Credit Agreement in which New Aptiv guaranteed the obligations under each Credit Agreement. Following the reorganization transaction, Aptiv Swiss Holdings replaced Old Aptiv as an obligor under the Credit Agreements, the senior notes and the junior notes, and New Aptiv became a guarantor under the Credit Agreements (and will act as the “parent entity” thereunder) and the indentures.\nAs a result of the Transaction described above, there were no material changes in Aptiv PLC’s operations or governance. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nReferences in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the exhibits being filed as part of this report, to “Aptiv PLC,” “Aptiv,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refers to Old Aptiv (Aptiv PLC before the Transaction in December 2024) and to New Aptiv (Aptiv PLC after the Transaction in December 2024).\nAptiv is a global technology company focused on making the world safer, greener and more connected.

Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nOur Company\nWe believe the automotive industry is being shaped by rapidly increasing consumer demand for new mobility solutions, advanced technologies, including software-defined vehicles, and vehicle connectivity, as well as government regulation related to vehicle safety, fuel efficiency and emissions control. More broadly, the “Safe,” “Green” and “Connected” mega-trends are expected to drive higher growth for our products than the underlying markets they serve. We have organized our business into two diversified segments, which enable us to develop technology solutions and manufacture highly-engineered products that enable our customers to respond to these mega-trends:\n•\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience\n—This segment, which includes our Active Safety, User Experience and Smart Vehicle Compute and Software businesses, provides critical technologies and services to enhance vehicle safety, security, comfort and convenience, including sensing and perception systems, electronic control units, multi-domain controllers, vehicle connectivity systems, cloud-native software platforms, application software, autonomous driving technologies and end-to-end DevOps tools. \n•\nSignal and Power Solutions\n—This segment, which includes our Engineered Components Group and Electrical Distribution Systems businesses, provides complete design, manufacture and assembly of the vehicle’s electrical architecture, including engineered component products, connectors, wiring assemblies and harnesses, cable management, electrical centers and high voltage power and safety-critical data distribution systems. Our products provide the signal distribution and computing power backbone that supports increased vehicle content and electrification, reduced emissions, higher fuel economy and off-vehicle connectivity.\nRefer to Results of Operations by Segment in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 22. Segment Reporting to the audited consolidated financial statements for financial information about our business segments.\nOur business is diversified across end-markets, regions, customers, vehicle platforms and products. Our customer base includes the 25 largest automotive OEMs in the world, and in 2024, 29% of our net sales came from the Asia Pacific region, which we have identified as a key market likely to experience substantial long-term growth. Our ten largest platforms in 2024 were with seven different OEMs. In addition, in 2024 our products were found in 17 of the 20 top-selling vehicle models in the United States (“U.S.”), 17 of the 20 top-selling vehicle models in Europe and 12 of the 20 top-selling vehicle models in China.\nWe have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from best cost countries. This regional model is structured primarily to service the North American market from Mexico, the South American market from Brazil, the European market from Eastern Europe and North Africa, and the Asia Pacific market from China. Our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest OEMs, which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis. Our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global OEMs require while also serving key growth market OEMs.\nOur Industry\nThe automotive technology and components industry provides critical technologies, components, systems, subsystems and modules to OEMs for the manufacture of new vehicles, as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles. In addition, the industry is increasingly progressing towards software-defined vehicles becoming critical elements of the overall automotive ecosystem. Overall, we expect long-term growth of global vehicle sales and production in the OEM market. In 2024, the industry experienced decreased global customer sales and production schedules, and increased inventory levels, primarily driven by various global uncertainties and global inflationary pressures. Global automotive vehicle production decreased 1% (3% on an Aptiv weighted market basis, which represents global vehicle production weighted to the geographic regions in which the Company generates its revenue) from 2023 to 2024, reflecting \n6\nTable of Contents\nvehicle production declines of 5% in Europe and 2% in North America, partially offset by increased production of 4% in China and 3% in South America, our smallest region. Demand for automotive components in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment and other trends. Although OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production, participants in the automotive technology and components industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets, gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets. We believe that evolving entrants into the global transportation industry such as mobility providers, electric vehicle developers and smart cities will provide additional markets for our advanced technologies. We believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities, we are well-positioned to benefit from these opportunities.\nWe believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “mega-trends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of market-driven automotive technology advancement. We aim to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these mega-trends, and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers, both OEMs and others, to produce distinctive market-leading products. We have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these mega-trends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our customers.\nSafe\n.\n The first mega-trend, “Safe,” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs, but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring. OEMs continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets. As a result, suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs, as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safety features that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring. Examples of new and alternative technologies that incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance include lane departure warning and centering systems, adaptive cruise control and traffic jam assist, and driver and cabin monitoring systems.\nGreen\n.\n The second mega-trend, “Green,” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions, increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles. Green is a key mega-trend today because of the convergence of several issues: climate change, volatility in oil prices, an increasing number of vehicles in use worldwide and recent and pending regulation in every region regarding fuel economy and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. OEMs continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets. On a worldwide basis, the relevant authorities in the largest markets in which we operate have already instituted regulations requiring reductions in emissions and/or increased fuel economy. In many cases, other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2025 and beyond. Based on the current regulatory environment, we believe that OEMs, including those in the U.S., the European Union (the “E.U.”) and China, will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in carbon dioxide (“CO\n2\n”) emissions over the next ten years. For example, in the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) proposed new rules in 2023 that could require as much as 67% of all light-duty vehicles and 46% of medium-duty vehicles sold in the U.S. by model year 2032 to be all-electric, and the California Air Resources Board approved rules in 2022, which require that all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in California be electric vehicles or other zero-emission models by 2035. In 2023, the E.U. amended regulations, which require that all new passenger cars and vans sold in the E.U. to have zero CO\n2\n emissions by 2035. These and other standards will require meaningful innovation as OEMs and suppliers are challenged to find ways to improve engine management, electrical power consumption, vehicle weight and integration of electric vehicles and alternative technologies. As a result, suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy, emissions and performance for internal combustion engine vehicles. At the same time, suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions. We are developing key enabling technologies in the areas of vehicle charging and vehicle power distribution and control that are essential to the introduction of our customers’ electrified vehicle platforms. We are also enabling the trend towards vehicle electrification with high voltage electrification solutions that reduce CO\n2\n emissions and increase fuel economy, helping to make the world greener.\nConnected\n.\n The third mega-trend, “Connected,” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate today’s highly complex vehicles into the electronic operating environment, and provide drivers with connectivity to the global information network. The technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety, personalization, infotainment, productivity and convenience while driving, which in turn leads to increasing demand for electrical architecture as a foundation for this content. Also, with increased smart device usage in vehicles, driver distractions can be dramatically increased, which in turn results in greater risk of \n7\nTable of Contents\naccidents. We are pioneering vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication technologies which enable vehicles to detect and signal danger, reducing vehicle collisions and improving driver safety, while also maintaining connectivity to an increasing number of devices inside and outside of vehicles. We also utilize advanced connectivity solutions such as over-the-air (OTA) technology that enable vehicles to receive software updates remotely and collect market-relevant data from connected vehicles.\nWe expect these mega-trends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us. We believe we are well-positioned to provide solutions and products to OEMs to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles. We also believe electronics integration, which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits, software algorithms, sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow OEMs to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity, resulting in easier assembly, enhanced fuel economy, improved emissions control and better vehicle performance.\nConvergence of Safe, Green and Connected Solutions\nThe combination of advanced technologies being developed within these mega-trends is contributing to the digital transformation across mission-critical industries. Intelligent, software-defined solutions, such as increasingly capable automated driving technologies, will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for long-term growth for our product offerings, including new potential customers such as mobility providers, telecommunications network operators and smart cities. Societal benefits of increased vehicle automation include enhanced safety (resulting from collision avoidance and improved vehicle control), environmental improvements (a reduction in CO\n2\n emissions resulting from optimized driving behavior), labor cost savings and improved productivity (as a result of alternate uses for drive time) and unlocking new software and data-driven services. Growth opportunities in this space result from increased content, additional computing power and software requirements, solutions to enhance lifecycle management and connectivity, increased electrification and high-speed data interconnects. We believe the complexity of these systems will also require ongoing software support services, as these vehicle systems will be continuously upgraded with new features and performance enhancements \nAs part of our strategy to harness the full potential of connected intelligent systems across industries, strengthen our capabilities in software-defined mobility and to enable advanced smart vehicle architecture changes, we acquired Wind River Systems, Inc. (“Wind River”) in December 2022. Wind River is a global leader in delivering software for the intelligent edge for multiple industries, including automotive, by leveraging mixed-criticality software products and solutions enabling customers to develop in the cloud, deploy over the air and run and manage software at the vehicle edge. \nWe are also continuing to develop market-leading automated driving solutions such as automated driving software, sensing and perception technologies enhanced through artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as the underlying architecture technologies capable of supporting safety-critical applications. We believe we are well-aligned with industry technology trends that will help to support sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies.\nIn March 2020, we completed a transaction with Hyundai Motor Group (“Hyundai”) to form Motional AD LLC (“Motional”), a joint venture focused on the design, development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies. Although we believe our strategic partnerships have us well-aligned with industry technology mega-trends in these evolving areas, the timeline necessary to produce commercially viable autonomous vehicles has been extended and is still subject to significant uncertainty, which resulted in additional funding requirements for Motional. In April 2024, Aptiv and Hyundai entered into an agreement to restructure Aptiv’s ownership interest in Motional and for Hyundai to provide additional funding to Motional, which also eliminated any requirements for additional future funding from Aptiv. These transactions, which were completed in May 2024, resulted in the reduction of our common equity interest in Motional from 50% as of December 31, 2023 to approximately 15%. The total gain recorded as a result of these transactions was approximately $641 million ($2.50 per diluted share) during the year ended December 31, 2024, within net gain on equity method transactions in the consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 5. Investments in Affiliates to the audited consolidated financial statements contained herein for further information on these transactions.\nStandardization of Sourcing by OEMs\nMany OEMs are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization, reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. As a result, OEMs are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations. Suppliers with global scale and strong design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, are best positioned to benefit from this trend. OEMs are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs and weight. As a result, suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers (Tier I suppliers) have assumed many of the design, engineering, research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers. Suppliers that can provide fully engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing.\n8\nTable of Contents\nShorter Product Development Cycles\nAs a result of government regulations and customer preferences, OEMs are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations. While these trends are more prevalent in mature markets, certain key growth markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets. Suppliers with strong technologies, robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet OEM demands for rapid innovation.\nProducts\nOur organizational structure and management reporting support the management of these core product lines:\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience\n. This segment provides critical technologies and services to enhance vehicle safety, security, comfort and convenience, including sensing and perception systems, electronic control units, multi-domain controllers, vehicle connectivity systems, cloud-native software platforms, application software, autonomous driving technologies and end-to-end DevOps tools.\n•\nAdvanced Safety primarily consists of solutions that enable advanced safety features and vehicle automation, as well as radar, vision and other sensing technologies.\n•\nUser Experience primarily enables in-cabin solutions around infotainment, driver interface and interior sensing solutions.\n•\nSmart Vehicle Compute and Software primarily consists of zone control and centralized computing platforms, as well as edge-to-cloud tools.\nSignal and Power Solutions\n. This segment provides complete design, manufacture and assembly of the vehicle’s electrical architecture, including engineered component products, connectors, wiring assemblies and harnesses, cable management, electrical centers and high voltage and safety-critical distribution systems. Our products provide the signal distribution and computing power backbone that supports increased vehicle content and electrification, reduced emissions, higher fuel economy and off-vehicle connectivity.\n•\nEngineered Components Group consists of high quality connectors engineered primarily for use in automotive and related markets, which also have applications in the industrial, telematics, aerospace, defense and medical sectors, as well as Electrical Centers, which provide centralized electrical power and signal distribution and all of the associated circuit protection and switching devices needed to support the optimization of the overall vehicle electrical system.\n•\nElectrical Distribution Systems, including 48-volt hybrid and high voltage systems, are integrated into one optimized vehicle electrical system that can utilize smaller cable and gauge sizes and ultra-thin wall insulation (this product line makes up approximately 42%, 43% and 44% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively).\nCompetition\nAlthough the overall number of our top competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation, the automotive technology and components industry remains extremely competitive. Furthermore, the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted, and may continue to attract, new entrants, particularly in best cost countries such as China and in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as intelligent systems software, automated driving and mobility solutions, which has attracted competitors from outside the traditional automotive industry. OEMs rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality, price, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design capability, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, financial viability, application of lean principles, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. In addition, our customers generally require that we demonstrate improved efficiencies, through cost reductions and/or price improvement, on a year-over-year basis.\n9\nTable of Contents\nOur key competitors in each of our operating segments include but are not limited to:\nSegment\nCompetitors\nSignal and Power Solutions\n•  Amphenol Corporation\n•  Draexlmaier Group\n•  Lear Corporation\n•  Luxshare Precision Industry Co., Ltd.\n•  Molex, LLC (a subsidiary of Koch, Inc.)\n•  Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.\n•  TE Connectivity plc\n•  Yazaki Corporation\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience\n•  Bosch Group\n•  Continental AG\n•  Denso Corporation\n•  Harman International (a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics)\n•  Hyundai Mobis\n•  LG Electronics\n•  Magna International, Inc.\n•  Panasonic Corporation\n•  Valeo\n•  Visteon Corporation\n•  ZF Friedrichshafen AG\nCustomers\nWe sell our products and services to the major global OEMs in every region of the world. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 55% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, none of which individually exceeded 10%.\nSupply Relationships with Our Customers\nWe typically supply products to our OEM customers through purchase orders, which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each OEM. Although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer, they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. These relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle. Prices are negotiated with respect to each business award, which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances, such as commodity or foreign exchange escalation/de-escalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us. The terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied; in most cases, the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the OEM to the end-user of the vehicle. We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products.\nIndividual purchase orders are terminable for cause or non-performance and, in most cases, upon our insolvency and certain change of control events. In addition, many of our OEM customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs, which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program, and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program, which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts. We manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules, normally provided on a weekly basis, which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels.\nAlthough customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of OEM production during such future periods, customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders. Firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials, sub-components and work-in-process inventory for OEM orders and from current on-hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders. The dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved.\n10\nTable of Contents\nMaterials\nWe procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world. Generally, we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs. The most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include copper and resins. As of December 31, 2024, we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials, however, as a result of our customers’ recent production volatility and cancellations, our balance of productive, raw and component material inventories has increased substantially from customary levels. These changes to the production environment were primarily driven by the global supply chain disruptions that impacted the automotive industry at times during previous years. We continue to actively monitor and manage inventory levels across all inventory types in order to maximize both supply continuity and the efficient use of working capital. Normally we do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules. \nCommodity cost volatility, most notably related to copper, petroleum-based resin products and fuel, is a challenge for us and our industry. Recently, the industry has been subjected to increased pricing pressures, specifically in relation to these commodities, which have experienced significant volatility in price. We have also been impacted globally by increased overall inflation as a result of a variety of global trends. We are continually seeking to manage these and other material-related cost pressures using a combination of strategies, including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs, seeking alternative product designs and material specifications, combining our purchase requirements with our customers and/or suppliers, changing suppliers, hedging of certain commodities and other means. In the case of copper, which primarily affects our Signal and Power Solutions segment, contract clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products. Other than in the case of copper, our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited. However, we have negotiated, and will continue to negotiate as necessary, price increases with our customers in response to global inflationary pressures and the aforementioned global supply chain disruptions. We will continue our efforts to pass market-driven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts, including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire.\nSeasonality\nIn general, our business is moderately seasonal, as our primary North American customers historically reduce production during the month of July and halt operations for approximately one week in December. Our European customers generally reduce production during the months of July and August and for one week in December. Our Chinese customers generally halt operations for one week during the months of February and October. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. In addition, automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of July, August and September due to the launch of component production for new vehicle models.\nPeople\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 141,000 people; 31,000 salaried employees and 110,000 hourly employees. In addition, we maintain a contingent workforce of approximately 50,000 to accommodate fluctuations in customer demand. We are a global company serving every major worldwide market. As of December 31, 2024 our workforce is distributed as follows:\n•\n51% in North America, with our largest presence in Mexico;\n•\n31% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, with our largest presence in Morocco and Serbia;\n•\n14% in the Asia Pacific region, with our largest presence in China and India; and\n•\n4% in South America, with our largest presence in Brazil.\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately 50% of our total workforce were women, and approximately 25% of management roles were held by women. \nCertain of our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils, including the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers - Communications Workers of America, IG Metall and the Confederacion De Trabajadores Mexicanos. We maintain collaborative and constructive labor relationships with our employee representatives in order to foster positive employee relations.\nOur Board of Directors reviews Aptiv’s talent strategy, and our Compensation & Human Resources Committee (“CHRC”) reviews employee retention, attrition and pay equity on a continual basis. A key accomplishment in 2024 included sustaining pay equity by race in the United States and gender pay equity among comparable roles globally.\n11\nTable of Contents\nTalent Development\nOur people are central to our mission of developing safer, greener and more connected solutions. We continually strive to create and maintain an environment where innovation thrives and our employees are empowered to think and act like owners. To this end, we continually provide training, coaching and mentoring to our employees at all levels, as well as internal job opportunities including global rotations and stretch assignments to help our employees develop and grow their careers. This dedication to employee growth and development was demonstrated by approximately 70% of our management role openings being filled through internal promotions in 2024. We manage succession planning as part of our monthly operating cadence and segment, technical, and senior executive leadership succession plans are reviewed with the CHRC, Innovation and Technology Committees, and our Board of Directors annually.\nAptiv is committed to talent development and growing the next generation of leaders. Our established career and leadership programs provide our leaders with the tools to be effective today while preparing them for future challenges. Our people consistently complete formal leadership and management training to enhance their abilities. We also leverage Aptiv Academy, our online learning management system, across the business, using in-person, online and virtual reality learning opportunities. We continue to focus on developing great people in order to maximize organizational effectiveness.\nCulture\nAptiv’s culture is a key advantage to how we do business. Our culture is based on a set of distinct values and behaviors that guide us to always do the right thing, the right way. At Aptiv, we value each individual’s perspective and we foster an environment of respect and inclusion. Aptiv participates in, and sponsors numerous outreach programs around the world, which seek to promote and recruit the next generation of talent into science, technology, engineering and mathematical (STEM) fields. Leveraging our employees’ diverse backgrounds and experiences allows us to make better decisions and supports stronger performance. Aptiv is continuing to drive innovation through an inclusive workforce for all, where every individual feels a sense of belonging within the organization.\nCulture is a central pillar in our business and helps to drive consistent leadership behavior across our businesses. We routinely provide training to provide managers and employees with the skills and capabilities that will lead Aptiv into the future. Additionally, we conduct regular employee feedback surveys to ensure our employees have the opportunity to be heard and to measure engagement, which includes assessing each employee’s commitment to our company’s goals and the overall employee experience. In December 2024, 83% of our salaried employees responded to this survey. Aptiv saw a higher participation rate and moved closer to the industry benchmark of 7.9 with a score of 7.7. Aptiv’s score has been consistently in the middle range of the Technology and Manufacturing benchmarks. Our management team actively utilizes feedback at all levels of our organization to continually improve how we engage with our people and improve our operations.\nWe recognize that sustaining a leadership culture requires continual focus and attention. Accordingly, senior executives and leaders throughout the Company commit time, resources and attention to ensure our culture continues to differentiate Aptiv as a great place to work.\nHealth and Safety\nWe prioritize the health, safety and well-being of all our employees by focusing on prevention, training, auditing and risk mitigation in our manufacturing plants, technical centers and offices. We routinely assess occupational health and safety risks, define controls and perform internal audits for all manufacturing sites, assessing, among other things, legal compliance, controls and key workplace safety metrics. We are a leader in workplace safety as reflected in our lost time injury frequency rate of 0.132 cases per million hours worked and our lost workday case rate per 100 employees of 0.026 for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our standard safety management system is aligned with ISO 45001 and we are committed to ensuring all of our manufacturing sites are ISO 45001 certified by 2025. As of December 31, 2024, 85% of our sites are certified under this standard.\nCommitment to Environmental Sustainability\nSustainability has always been core to Aptiv’s business, values and culture. We believe this strong, foundational focus on sustainability makes Aptiv a partner of choice for our customers, a desirable place to work for our employees and a valued contributor to the communities in which we operate. While a key part of our business is to design solutions that help transition the world’s vehicles to cleaner sources of power, we are also committed to reducing our environmental footprint throughout our operations around the globe. We aim to reduce our environmental impact by decreasing our carbon footprint, reducing waste generated and consuming less water in our operations. Expenditures required to meet our environmental sustainability goals, which are described below, are included in our normal budgeting process.\n12\nTable of Contents\nDecreasing our Carbon Footprint\nAptiv has committed to the Science-Based Targets initiative (the “SBTi”) Business Ambition for 1.5℃ campaign, which requires greenhouse gas emissions to be net-zero across Aptiv’s value chain by 2050 at the latest. Our target is to reach net-zero by 2040. Aptiv’s targets were validated by the SBTi in November 2023. To achieve these commitments, we are targeting:\n•\nReducing Scope 1 and 2 absolute CO2e emissions by 100% between the baseline year (2021) and 2030;\n•\nReducing Scope 3 absolute CO2e emissions by 47% between the baseline year and 2030, and achieving 100% reduction by 2040;\n•\nMaintaining annual certification of all major manufacturing sites to the ISO 14001 standard;\n•\nCertifying ten of the most energy-intensive sites to the ISO 50001 certification by 2025;\n•\nSourcing 100% of electricity for operations from renewable sources by 2030; and\n•\nDelivering only carbon-neutral products by 2039, from sourcing to disposal.\nKey to achieving these goals is our global Environmental, Health and Safety and Sustainability management system, which helps to keep us aligned with stringent environmental, health and safety regulations and provides a structure for continuous improvement. This system applies to all Aptiv sites, which means that in some countries our procedures go beyond local regulations and requirements. This system is continuously updated to ensure that our procedures remain up to date.\nReducing our Water Usage and Waste Generated\nWhile our operations are not water intensive, we include water in our environmental risk management approach. We identify locations where we operate that are water-scarce and take action to reduce our water consumption accordingly, while also striving to comply with best practices in lower-risk locations. Our goal is to reduce water consumption in high-risk (water-scarce) locations by 2% per year through 2025.\nWe are also committed to reducing waste, with a waste recycled target (volume of recycled waste divided by total waste volume) of 80%. We continue to strive to actively reduce and manage waste across our manufacturing operations, as well as in our offices. We are creating packaging that uses less material and we continue to strive to increase the share of waste and excess materials we divert to recycling.\nAdditional Sustainability Information\nAdditional information regarding our environmental sustainability and human capital initiatives, as well as information on our progress towards our commitments, is available in our annual Sustainability Report located on our website at \nwww.aptiv.com/about/sustainability\n. Nothing on our website, including the aforementioned Sustainability Report, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\n13\nTable of Contents\nSUPPLEMENTARY ITEM.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help you understand the business operations and financial condition of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2024. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our MD&A is presented in seven sections:\n•\nExecutive Overview\n•\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n•\nResults of Operations by Segment\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n•\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\n•\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nExecutive Overview\nOur Business\nWe are a global technology company focused on making the world safer, greener and more connected. We deliver end-to-end mobility solutions, enabling our customers’ transition to a more electrified, software-defined future. We design and manufacture vehicle components and provide electrical, electronic and active safety technology to the global automotive and commercial vehicle markets, creating the software and hardware foundation for vehicle features and functionality. Our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment is focused on providing the necessary software and advanced computing platforms, and our Signal and Power Solutions segment is focused on providing the requisite networking architecture required to support the integrated systems in today’s complex vehicles. Together, our businesses develop the ‘brain’ and the ‘nervous system’ of increasingly complex vehicles, providing integration of the vehicle into its operating environment.\nWe are one of the largest vehicle technology suppliers and our customers include the 25 largest automotive OEMs in the world.\nIn December 2024, Old Aptiv (as defined below) completed its previously announced reorganization transaction (the “Transaction,” or the “reorganization transaction”), in which Old Aptiv established a new publicly-listed Jersey parent company, Aptiv Holdings Limited (“New Aptiv”), which is resident for tax purposes in Switzerland. As a result of the Transaction, all issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Old Aptiv were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for newly issued ordinary shares of New Aptiv. Following consummation of the Transaction, holders of Old Aptiv shares became ordinary shareholders of New Aptiv, Old Aptiv became a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Aptiv and New Aptiv was renamed “Aptiv PLC.” The previous publicly-listed Jersey parent company, which was an Irish tax resident, is referred to as “Old Aptiv” throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. New Aptiv’s ordinary shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “APTV,” the same symbol under which the Old Aptiv shares were previously listed. Aptiv PLC remains a public limited company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, and continues to be subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements.\nIn December 2024, following the completion of the Transaction, Old Aptiv merged with and into Aptiv Swiss Holdings Limited (“Aptiv Swiss Holdings”), a newly formed Jersey incorporated private limited company, and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of New Aptiv, with Aptiv Swiss Holdings surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of New Aptiv, and Old Aptiv ceasing to exist. Except as otherwise noted, all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Old Aptiv vested in Aptiv Swiss Holdings, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Old Aptiv became debts, liabilities and duties of Aptiv Swiss Holdings. As a result of the Transaction described above, there were no material changes in Aptiv PLC’s operations or governance. \nIn connection with the Transaction, New Aptiv assumed Old Aptiv’s Long-Term Incentive Plans and its existing obligations in connection with awards granted thereunder, and Aptiv Swiss Holdings (i) entered into a supplemental indenture to each indenture in which Aptiv Swiss Holdings assumed all of Old Aptiv’s obligations under each series of Old Aptiv’s outstanding Notes and (ii) entered into an assumption and/or supplement agreement relating to each Credit Agreement in which New Aptiv assumed all of Old Aptiv’s obligations under each Credit Agreement as the “parent entity” thereunder. In addition, New Aptiv (i) entered into a supplemental indenture to each indenture in which New Aptiv guaranteed the outstanding Notes and (ii) entered into a guarantee joinder relating to each Credit Agreement in which New Aptiv guaranteed the obligations under each Credit Agreement. Following the reorganization transaction, Aptiv Swiss Holdings replaced Old Aptiv as an obligor \n34\nTable of Contents\nunder the Credit Agreements, the senior notes and the junior notes, and New Aptiv became a guarantor under the Credit Agreements (and will act as the “parent entity” thereunder) and the indentures.\nPlanned Spin-off of Electrical Distribution Systems Business\nOn January 22, 2025, we announced our intention to pursue a separation of our Electrical Distribution Systems business through a transaction expected to be treated as a tax-free spin-off to Aptiv’s shareholders. The Company plans to complete the separation by March 31, 2026, subject to customary closing conditions.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe believe the Company is well-positioned for growth from the industry’s accelerating transition to software-defined vehicles, the commercialization of active safety, the adoption of autonomous driving technologies, enhanced user experiences and connected services, and providing the software, advanced computing platforms and networking architecture required to do so. We have successfully created a competitive cost structure while investing in research and development to grow our product offerings, which are aligned with the high-growth industry mega-trends, and re-aligned our manufacturing footprint into an efficient, low-cost regional service model, focused on increasing our profit margins.\nOur 2024 performance reflects our solid execution and cost reduction initiatives despite declines in volume and the global inflationary environment. Our recent financial and business achievements include the following:\n•\nGenerating new business awards of approximately $31 billion, based on expected volumes and prices, validating our industry leading portfolio of advanced technologies tied to the accelerating megatrends in our industry\n•\nDelivering strong earnings growth over the prior year despite declines in volume and the global inflationary environment\n•\nProducing $1.8 billion of operating income, or $2.4 billion of adjusted operating income, and cash flow from operations of $2.4 billion, demonstrating strong operating execution in the face of continuing material cost inflation\n◦\nDelivering expanded operating income margin of 9.3%, or adjusted operating income margin of 12.0%, driven by strong operating performance and cost reduction initiatives \n•\nFunding $4.1 billion in share repurchases, including $3.0 billion under the terms of the Company’s accelerated share repurchase program (“ASR”)\n•\nRefinancing over $1.4 billion in near-term debt maturities and successfully maintaining a well-laddered debt maturity profile, providing financial flexibility and reducing short-term refinancing risks\n•\nRestructuring our Motional AD LLC (“Motional”) joint venture ownership, reducing our common equity interest in Motional from 50% to 15%, eliminating future cash funding requirements while maintaining access to insights and market intelligence \n•\nContinuing our relentless focus on cost structure and operational optimization\n◦\nMaximizing our operational flexibility and profitability at all points in the normal automotive business cycle, by having approximately 97% of our hourly workforce based in best cost countries, and approximately 31% of our hourly workforce composed of contingent employees.\n•\nEnhancing our optimized full system, edge-to-cloud capabilities\n◦\nOngoing advancement in adapting advanced driver assistance systems to leverage containerized, service-based software architecture; and\n◦\nIncreasing our customer choice and regional flexibility through investments in computer vision providers StradVision, Inc. (“StradVision”) and MAXIEYE Automotive Technology (Ningbo) Co., Ltd. (“Maxieye”).\n•\nMeeting the sustainability-linked targets for greenhouse gas emissions and workplace safety within our Credit Agreement.\nOur strategy is to build on these accomplishments and continue to develop and manufacture innovative market-relevant products for a diverse base of customers around the globe and leverage our lean and flexible cost structure to achieve strong and disciplined earnings growth and returns on invested capital. Through our culture of innovation and world class engineering capabilities we intend to employ our rigorous, forward-looking product development process to deliver new technologies that provide solutions to our customers. We are committed to creating value for our shareholders, including through the continued repurchase of shares. Our key strategic priorities include:\nCommercializing the high-tech evolution of the automotive industry\n. The automotive industry is increasingly evolving towards the implementation of software-dependent components and solutions. In particular, the industry is focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially-viable, fully automated driving experience. We expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for long-term growth for our product offerings in this space. We are focused on enabling and delivering end-to-\n35\nTable of Contents\nend smart mobility solutions, enabling our customers’ transition to more electrified, software-defined vehicles, accelerating the commercialization of active safety and autonomous driving technologies and providing enhanced user experience and connected services.\nAs part of our strategy to harness the full potential of connected intelligent systems across industries, strengthen our capabilities in software-defined mobility and to enable advanced smart vehicle architecture changes, we acquired Wind River in December 2022. Wind River is a global leader in delivering software for the intelligent edge for multiple industries, including automotive, by leveraging mixed-criticality software products and solutions enabling customers to develop in the cloud, deploy over the air and run and manage software at the vehicle edge. \nWe are also continuing to develop market-leading automated driving solutions such as automated driving software, sensing and perception technologies enhanced through artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as the underlying architecture technologies capable of supporting safety-critical applications. We believe we are well-aligned with industry technology trends that will help to support sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies.\nIn March 2020, we completed a transaction with Hyundai Motor Group (“Hyundai”) to form Motional, a joint venture focused on the design, development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies. Although we believe our strategic partnerships have us well-aligned with industry technology mega-trends in these evolving areas, the timeline necessary to produce commercially viable autonomous vehicles has been extended and is still subject to significant uncertainty, which resulted in additional funding requirements for Motional. In April 2024, Aptiv and Hyundai entered into an agreement to restructure Aptiv’s ownership interest in Motional and for Hyundai to provide additional funding to Motional, which also eliminated any requirements for additional future funding from Aptiv. These transactions, which were completed in May 2024, resulted in the reduction of our common equity interest in Motional from 50% as of December 31, 2023 to approximately 15%. The total gain recorded as a result of these transactions was approximately $641 million ($2.50 per diluted share) during the year ended December 31, 2024, within net gain on equity method transactions in the consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 5. Investments in Affiliates to the audited consolidated financial statements contained herein for further information on these transactions.\nThere are many risks associated with these evolving areas, including the high development costs of active safety and autonomous driving technologies, the uncertain timing of customer and consumer adoption of these technologies, increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry and evolving regulations, such as the guidance for automated driving systems published by the U.S. Department of Transportation. While we believe we are well-positioned in these markets, the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us or our partners and ultimately there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to develop these technologies.\nLeveraging our engineering and technological capabilities\n. We seek to leverage our strong product portfolio tied to the industry’s key mega-trends with our global footprint to increase our revenues, as well as committing to substantial annual investment in research and development to maintain and enhance our leadership in new mobility solutions across each of our product lines.\nTargeting the right business with the right customers\n. We intend to be strategic in our pursuit of new business and customers in order to achieve disciplined, above-market growth. We conduct in-depth analysis of market share and product trends by region in order to prioritize research, development and engineering spend for the customers that we believe will be successful. Collaboration with customers in our 11 major technical centers around the world helps us develop innovative product solutions designed to meet their needs. As more OEMs design vehicles for global platforms, where the same vehicle architecture is shared among different regions, we are well suited to provide global design and engineering support while manufacturing these products for a specific regional market.\nCapitalizing on our scale, global footprint and established position in key growth markets\n. We intend to generate sustained growth by capitalizing on the breadth and scale of our operating capabilities. Our global footprint provides us important proximity to our customers’ manufacturing facilities and allows us to serve them in every region in which they operate. We anticipate that we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on growing automotive markets, particularly in China. In addition, our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards key growth markets.\nLeveraging our lean and flexible cost structure to deliver profitability and cash flow\n. We recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible cost structure in order to deliver stable earnings and cash flow in a cyclical industry. Our focus is on maximizing and optimizing manufacturing output to meet increasing production requirements with minimal additions to our fixed-cost base. Additionally, we are continuing to use a meaningful amount of temporary workers to ensure we have the appropriate operational flexibility to scale our operations so that we can maintain our profitability as industry production levels increase or contract.\n36\nTable of Contents\nAdvancing and maintaining an efficient capital structure. \nWe actively manage our capital structure in order to maintain an investment grade credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support our business and maximize shareholder value. We will continue to make adjustments to our capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions or as opportunities arise to provide us with additional financial flexibility to invest in our business and execute our strategic objectives going forward.\nPursuing selected acquisitions and strategic investments\n. In recent years, we continued to complete selected acquisitions and strategic investments in order to continue to leverage our technology capabilities and enhance and expand our commercialization of new mobility solutions, product offerings, customer base, geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses, while continuing to enhance our product offerings and competitive position in growing market segments.\nAccelerating an electric, zero-emissions future. \nWe are committed to becoming carbon-neutral in our global operations by 2030 and to achieving net carbon neutrality by 2040 as we transition away from carbon-intensive energy and processes in our global operations. We also continue to focus on minimizing the overall environmental impact of vehicles as a key part of our overall business strategy. We believe that this strong, foundational focus on sustainability makes Aptiv a partner of choice for our customers, a desirable place to work for our employees and a valued contributor to the communities in which we operate.\nTrends, Uncertainties and Opportunities\nEconomic conditions\n. Our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers. Automotive sales depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions. Global automotive vehicle production decreased 1% (3% on an Aptiv weighted market basis, which represents global vehicle production weighted to the geographic regions in which the Company generates its revenue, “AWM”) from 2023 to 2024, reflecting vehicle production declines of 5% in Europe and 2% in North America, partially offset by increased production of 4% in China and 3% in South America, our smallest region. Refer to Note 22. Segment Reporting of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for financial information concerning principal geographic areas.\nOn September 15, 2023, several of our largest customers’ collective bargaining agreements with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (the “UAW”), expired and the UAW subsequently went on strike against General Motors (“GM”), Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) and Stellantis N.V. (“Stellantis”) in the United States (the “U.S.”), causing work stoppages at certain of these customers’ vehicle production and parts distribution facilities, which lasted approximately six weeks. Aptiv’s estimated total indirect and direct adverse impacts of these labor strikes to revenue during 2023 were approximately $180 million. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks related to significant disruptions at our or our customers’ manufacturing facilities.\nEconomic volatility or weakness in North America, Europe, China or, to a lesser extent, South America, could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Global inflationary pressures have, at times, both reduced consumer demand for automotive vehicles and increased the price of inputs to our products, which has adversely impacted our sales and profitability, which may continue in 2025. There is also potential that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the U.S. and other economies, and specifically the automotive sector. In particular, changes to international trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, increases in trade tariffs, import quotas and other trade restrictions or actions, including retaliatory responses to such actions, or other political pressures could affect the operations of our OEM customers, resulting in reduced automotive production in certain regions or shifts in the mix of production to higher cost regions. Increases in interest rates could also negatively impact automotive production as a result of increased consumer borrowing costs or reduced credit availability. Additionally, economic weakness may result in shifts in the mix of future automotive sales (from vehicles with more content such as luxury vehicles, trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars). While our diversified customer and geographic revenue base, along with our flexible cost structure, have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns, shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability.\nUkraine/Russia conflict. \nThe conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which began in February 2022, has had, and is expected to continue to have, negative economic impacts to both countries and to the European and global economies. In response to the conflict, the European Union (the “E.U.”), the U.S. and other nations implemented broad economic sanctions against Russia. These countries may impose further sanctions and take other actions as the situation continues.\nGiven the sanctions put in place by the E.U., U.S. and other governments, which restrict our ability to conduct business in Russia, we initiated a plan in the second quarter of 2022 to exit our 51% owned subsidiary in Russia. As a result, the Company determined that this subsidiary, which was reported within the Signal and Power Solutions segment, initially met the held for sale criteria as of June 30, 2022. Consequently, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $51 million to impair the carrying value of the Russian subsidiary’s net assets to fair value.\n37\nTable of Contents\nOn May 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its entire interest in the Russian subsidiary to JSC Samara Cables Company, the sole minority shareholder in the Russian subsidiary, for a nominal amount in exchange for all of the Company’s shares in the subsidiary. The Company did not record any incremental gain or loss resulting from this disposition. Refer to Note 20. Acquisitions and Divestitures to the audited consolidated financial statements contained herein for further detail on this transaction.\nUkraine and Russia are significant global producers of raw materials used in our supply chain, including copper, aluminum, palladium and neon gases. Disruptions in the supply and volatility in the price of these materials and other inputs produced by Ukraine or Russia, including increased logistics costs and longer transit times, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. The conflict has also increased the possibility of cyberattacks occurring, which could either directly or indirectly impact our operations. Furthermore, the conflict has caused our customers to analyze their continued presence in the region and future customer production plans in the region remain uncertain.\nWe do not have a material physical presence in either Ukraine or Russia, with less than 1% of our workforce located in the countries as of December 31, 2024 and less than 1% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 generated from manufacturing facilities in those countries. However, the impacts of the conflict have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, global economies, and in particular, the European economy, a region which accounted for approximately 33% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024. As a result of the conflict, the Company ceased using certain long-lived assets in Ukraine and consequently recorded non-cash impairment charges of $11 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. These charges were recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Furthermore, as a result of the conflict, we estimate that the adverse impacts to revenue from Russia operations were approximately $65 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWe continue to monitor the situation and will seek to minimize its impact to our business, while prioritizing the safety and well-being of our employees located in both countries and our compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the locations where we operate. Any of the impacts mentioned above, among others, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \nGlobal supply chain disruptions. \nGlobal supply chain disruptions could lead to interruptions in our production, which could impact our ability to fully meet the vehicle production demands of OEMs at times due to events which are outside our control. We will continue to actively monitor our global supply chain and will seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize the impact of any future disruptions on our business.\nIn addition, we are carrying critical inventory items and key components, and we continue to procure productive, raw material and non-critical inventory components in order to satisfy our customers’ vehicle production schedules. However, as a result of our customers’ recent production volatility and cancellations, among other things, our balance of productive, raw and component material inventories has increased substantially from customary levels as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. We will continue to actively monitor and manage inventory levels across all inventory types in order to maximize both supply continuity and the efficient use of working capital.\nKey growth markets\n. There have been periods of increased market volatility and moderation in the level of economic growth in China, which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in China than those previously experienced. Automotive production in China experienced growth of 4% in 2024, which follows growth of 10% in 2023. Despite the market volatility and moderation in the level of economic growth in China, rising income levels in China and other key growth markets are expected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the long-term. Our strong global presence, and presence in these markets, has positioned us to experience above-market growth rates over the long-term. We continue to expand our established presence in key growth markets, positioning us to benefit from the expected long-term growth opportunities in these regions. We are capitalizing on our long-standing relationships with the global OEMs and further enhancing our positions with the key growth market OEMs to continue expanding our worldwide leadership. We continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fast-growing automotive markets. We believe that our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the key growth markets.\nWe have a strong local presence in China, including a major manufacturing base and well-established customer relationships. Each of our business segments have operations and sales in China. Our business in China remains sensitive to economic and market conditions that impact automotive sales volumes in China, and may be affected if the pace of growth slows as the Chinese market matures or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in China, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental lockdowns in 2022. Estimated total indirect and direct adverse impacts to revenue as a result of these lockdowns during 2022 was approximately $270 million. Our business in China may also be impacted by the expanding market share of domestic Chinese OEMs in the China market, which has led to declines in revenue and market share of non-Chinese OEMs, resulting in certain traditional OEMs taking steps to reduce or restructure their operations in China. \n38\nTable of Contents\nHowever, we continue to believe this market will benefit from long-term demand for new vehicles and stringent governmental regulation driving increased vehicle content, including accelerated demand for electrified vehicles.\nMarket driven products\n. Our product offerings satisfy the OEMs’ needs to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the mega-trends of Safe, Green and Connected, leading to increased content per vehicle, greater profitability and higher margins. With these offerings, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content and technology related to safety, electrification, high speed data, connectivity to the global information network and automated driving technologies. We are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content, software and electrification that requires a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate, such as automated advanced driver assistance technologies, electrical vehicle monitoring, active safety systems, lane departure warning systems, integrated vehicle cockpit displays, navigation systems and technologies that enable connected infotainment in vehicles. Our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution and/or consumption is key to satisfying the OEMs’ needs to reduce emissions while continuing to meet consumer demand for increased vehicle content and technology. While we have identified high voltage electrification systems as a key product market, certain of our OEM customers have recently announced delays in their electric vehicle investment strategies amidst reduced expectations for future consumer demand for these products.\nGlobal capabilities\n. Many OEMs are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization, reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. As a result, OEMs are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis, as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations. Suppliers with global scale and strong design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, are best positioned to benefit from this trend. Our global footprint enables us to serve the global OEMs on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with key growth market OEMs. This regional model is structured primarily to service the North American market from Mexico, the South American market from Brazil, the European market from Eastern Europe and North Africa, and the Asia Pacific market from China, and we have continued to rotate our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations within these regions.\nOur operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business globally, including military conflicts in regions in which we operate, changes in laws or regulations governing labor, trade, or other monetary or tax fiscal policy changes, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) Pillar Two Framework (the “Framework”), tariffs, quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions or trade barriers. \nExisting free trade laws and regulations, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in February 2025, the U.S. government imposed or threatened to impose new tariffs on imported products from Mexico, Canada and China. The impact of these tariffs is subject to a number of factors, including the effective date and duration of such tariffs, changes in the amount, scope and nature of the tariffs in the future, any retaliatory responses to such actions that the target countries may take and any mitigating actions that may become available. Despite recent trade negotiations between the U.S. and the Mexican, Canadian and Chinese governments, given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of any new tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the U.S., Mexico, Canada, China or other countries, we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful. In addition, in October 2022, the U.S. government imposed additional export control restrictions targeting the export, re-export or transfer of, among other products, certain advanced computing semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing items and related technology to China, which could further disrupt supply chains and adversely impact our business. Management continues to monitor the volatile geopolitical environment to identify, quantify and assess proposed or threatened duties, taxes or other business restrictions which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, effective January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025, the government of Mexico implemented country-wide statutory minimum wage increases of 20% and 12%, respectively. Additionally, the government of Mexico has indicated it may implement other labor reforms, such as a bill to shorten the work week from 48 to 40 hours. While management has implemented measures to mitigate the impact of these labor reforms on our cost structure, we cannot predict the ultimate future impact on our business.\nFurthermore, the outbreak of armed conflicts in the Middle East beginning in October 2023 has created numerous uncertainties, including the risk that the conflicts spread throughout the broader region, and their impact on the global economy and supply chains. In addition, as described above, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia has also created numerous economic uncertainties, including the potential for further sanctions against Russia, the impact on the global supply chain for raw materials produced in each country, as well as increased logistics costs and transit times, and the actions of automotive OEMs and suppliers as they relate to production plans in each country and within the region. We are also subject to risks associated with actions taken by governmental authorities to impose changes in laws or regulations that restrict certain business \n39\nTable of Contents\noperations, trade or travel in response to a pandemic or widespread outbreak of an illness. The impacts of any of these factors mentioned above, among others, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nProduct development\n. The automotive technology and components industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. To compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry, we must be able to develop and launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner. With our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities we are well positioned to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands and consumer preferences for high-technology content in automobiles.\nOEMs are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs and weight. As a result, suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers (Tier I suppliers) have assumed many of the design, engineering, research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers. Suppliers that can provide fully-engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing.\nEngineering, design and development\n. Our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers. We have a team of approximately 21,200 scientists, engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets, located at 11 major technical centers in China, Germany, India, Mexico, Poland, Singapore and the United States. Our total investment in research and development, including engineering, was approximately $1.6 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which includes approximately $535 million, $492 million and $379 million of co-investment by customers and government agencies. Each year we share some engineering expenses with OEMs and government agencies which generally ranges from 25% to 35% of engineering expenses. This level of co-investment supports product development, accelerates the pace of innovation and reduces the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs. We also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry, government agencies and academic institutions. \nIn the past, suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering, designing and developing automotive component parts, and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes. Recently, we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes. This trend reduces our economic risk.\nWe utilize a Technology Advisory Council, a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders, which helps us anticipate cutting-edge technology trends and guides our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth and foster innovation. This independent perspective assists Aptiv in pursuing investments in the right technologies that create the most value for all of its stakeholders. We believe that our engineering and technical expertise, together with our emphasis on continuing research and development, allow us to use the latest technologies, materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new, innovative products to market. We believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products. Given our strong financial discipline, we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs, including investment in innovation and technology. We maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies. We expect expenditures for research and development activities, including engineering, net of co-investment, to be approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2025.\nWe maintain a large portfolio of approximately 11,000 patents and protective rights in the operation of our business as of December 31, 2024. While no individual patent or group of patents, taken alone, is considered material to our business, taken in the aggregate, these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations. Similarly, while our trademarks are important to identify our position in the industry, we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business. We are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and non-automotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests. These activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights.\nPricing\n. Cost-cutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing. Our customer supply agreements generally require step-downs in component pricing over the periods of production and OEMs have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive OEMs. Our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions. In addition, during recent years, global economies and \n40\nTable of Contents\nour industry were subjected to significant inflationary cost pressures, and these pressures may continue in 2025. We continue to work with our customers, both through price recoveries and adjustments as well as future pricing adjustments as contracts renew, to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures on our results of operations.\nWe are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle. As a result, approximately 97% of our hourly workforce is located in best cost countries. Furthermore, we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of contingent workers, which represented approximately 31% of the hourly workforce as of December 31, 2024. However, we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering, as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on reducing our global overhead costs and on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in Europe. As we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies, we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure. Assuming constant product mix and pricing, based on our 2024 results, we estimate that our EBITDA breakeven level would be reached if we experienced a 45% downturn to current product volumes.\nWe have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately $8.5 billion and substantial available liquidity of approximately $3.6 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents and available financing under our Revolving Credit Facility and committed European accounts receivable factoring facility (as defined below in Liquidity and Capital Resources) as of December 31, 2024, and no significant U.S. defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employer-paid postretirement basic life insurance benefits liabilities. We intend to maintain strong financial discipline by targeting industry-leading earnings growth, cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle.\nOEM product recalls\n. The number of vehicles recalled globally by OEMs has increased above historical levels. These recalls can either be initiated by the OEMs or influenced by regulatory agencies. Although there are differing rules and regulations across countries governing recalls for safety issues, the overall transition towards global vehicle platforms may also contribute to increased recalls outside of the U.S., as automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions. Given the sensitivity to safety issues in the automotive industry, including increased focus from regulators and consumers, we anticipate the number of automotive recalls may remain above historical levels in the near future. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, it is possible that we may be adversely affected in the future if the pace of these recalls continues.\nEfficient use of capital\n. The global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs. Lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years. Substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs.\nIndustry consolidation and disruptive new entrants\n. Consolidation among worldwide OEMs and suppliers is expected to continue as these companies seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies, acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships. Additionally, the rise of advanced software and technologies in vehicles has attracted new and disruptive entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry. These entrants may seek to gain access to certain vehicle technology and component markets. Any of these new competitors may develop and introduce technologies that gain greater customer or consumer acceptance, which could adversely affect the future growth of the Company. We believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of these trends.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur total net sales during the year ended December 31, 2024 were $19.7 billion, a decrease of approximately 2% compared to 2023. Our overall volumes decreased 2%, which was driven in part by decreased global automotive production of 1% (3% on an AWM basis) for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 2023 production rates. Despite declines in volume and the global inflationary environment, our overall lean cost structure has enabled us to achieve strong levels of operating income, while continuing to strategically invest in the future.\nAptiv typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in OEM production schedules, vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business (which we refer to collectively as volume), increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs (which we refer to as commodity pass-through), fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which we refer to as “FX”), contractual reductions of the sales price to the OEM (which we refer to as contractual price reductions) and engineering changes. Changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue. Such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth, shifts in OEM sales demand, as well as shifts in \n41\nTable of Contents\nconsumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration. For instance, a shift in sales demand favoring a particular OEM’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue. A shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions, which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue.\nWe typically experience (as described below) fluctuations in operating income due to:\n•\nVolume, net of contractual price reductions—changes in volume offset by contractual price reductions (which typically range from 1% to 3% of net sales) and changes in mix;\n•\nOperational performance—changes to costs for materials and commodities or manufacturing and engineering variances; and\n•\nOther—including restructuring costs and any remaining variances not included in Volume, net of contractual price reductions or Operational performance.\nThe automotive technology and component supply industry is traditionally subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain. For instance, the industry has recently been subjected to increased pricing pressures, specifically in relation to copper and petroleum-based resin products, which have experienced significant volatility in price. We have also been impacted globally by increased overall inflation as a result of a variety of global trends. Due to various factors, the industry has recently been impacted by increased operating and logistics challenges from certain global supply chain disruptions, including a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage. This shortage has resulted in increased pricing pressures on semiconductors as well. Although the severity of these disruptions abated during the second half of 2023, we expect semiconductor supply cost and commodity cost volatility to have a continual impact on future earnings and/or operating cash flows. As such, we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our material-related cost exposures using a number of approaches, including combining purchase requirements with customers and/or other suppliers, using alternate suppliers or product designs, negotiating cost reductions and/or commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging. We have also negotiated, and will continue to negotiate, price increases with our customers in response to the aforementioned increased overall inflation and global supply chain disruptions.\nThis section discusses our consolidated results of operations and results of operations by segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 versus 2023.

Our volumes decreased 2% for the period, which reflects decreased global automotive production of 1% (3% on an AWM basis), primarily in Europe and North America. The declines in volumes were partially offset by the impacts of favorable pricing, net of contractual price reductions, of $167 million. In addition, our net sales reflect net unfavorable foreign currency impacts, primarily related to the Chinese Yuan Renminbi. \nCost of Sales\nCost of sales is primarily comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, freight, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, product engineering, design and development expenses, depreciation, warranty costs and other operating expenses. Gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percentage of net sales.\nCost of sales decreased $610 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, as summarized below. The Company’s material cost of sales was approximately 50% and 55% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n43\nTable of Contents\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nVariance Due To:\n \n2024\n2023\nFavorable/\n(unfavorable)\nVolume (a)\nFX\nOperational\nperformance\nOther\nTotal\n \n(dollars in millions)\n(in millions)\nCost of sales\n$\n16,002 \n$\n16,612 \n$\n610 \n$\n371 \n$\n101 \n$\n356 \n$\n(218)\n$\n610 \nGross margin\n$\n3,711 \n$\n3,439 \n$\n272 \n$\n40 \n$\n16 \n$\n356 \n$\n(140)\n$\n272 \nPercentage of net sales\n18.8 \n%\n17.2 \n%\n(a)\nPresented net of contractual price reductions for gross margin variance.\nThe decrease in cost of sales reflects the impacts of improved operational performance, decreased volumes and currency exchange.

We expect to recognize additional charges of approximately $35 million in 2025 related to the restructuring program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2024, with cash payments expected to be principally completed in 2025. We expect to make cash payments of approximately $100 million in 2025 pursuant to currently implemented restructuring programs.\nThe Company recorded employee-related and other restructuring charges totaling approximately $211 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, of which $68 million was recognized for a program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2023 focused on global salaried workforce optimization, primarily in the North American and European regions. The charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023 also included the recognition of approximately $27 million of employee-related and other costs related to the initiation of the closure of a Western European manufacturing site within the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment pursuant to the Company’s ongoing European footprint rotation strategy. \nWe expect to continue to incur additional restructuring expense in 2025 and beyond, primarily related to programs focused on reducing global overhead costs, the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in Europe and aligning manufacturing capacity with the levels of automotive production, which includes approximately $55 million (of which approximately $40 million relates to the Signal and Power Solutions segment and approximately $15 million relates to the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment) for programs approved as of December 31, 2024, inclusive of $35 million related to the global salaried headcount reduction program described above, and are expected to be incurred within the next twelve months. Additionally, as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies, we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint. The Company plans to implement additional restructuring activities in the future, if necessary, in order to align manufacturing capacity and other costs with prevailing regional automotive production levels and locations, to improve the efficiency and utilization of other locations and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering. Such future restructuring actions are dependent on market conditions, customer actions and other factors.\nRefer to Note 10.

The Company’s effective tax rate is also impacted by the receipt of certain tax incentives and holidays that reduce the effective tax rate for certain subsidiaries below the statutory rate.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was 10% and (144)% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes discrete tax benefits primarily associated with intercompany reorganizations. Also included as a discrete item in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 is the beneficial impact of approximately 4 points resulting from the Motional funding and ownership restructuring transactions, as described further in Note 5. Investments in Affiliates to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein. There \n46\nTable of Contents\nwas no tax expense associated with these gains as Aptiv’s interest in Motional is exempt from capital gains tax in the jurisdiction in which it is owned.\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily impacted by the Company’s transfers of intellectual property, as described below. \nOn December 15, 2022, the European Union (the “E.U.”) Member States formally adopted the Framework, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the OECD. Many countries have enacted legislation consistent with the Framework effective at the beginning of 2024. The OECD continues to release additional guidance on these rules. The Company has proactively responded to these tax policy changes, as described below, and will continue to closely monitor developments. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes an unfavorable impact from the enacted Framework.\nIn response to the Framework, the Company initiated changes to its corporate entity structure, including intercompany transfers of certain intellectual property to one of its subsidiaries in Switzerland, during the second half of 2023. Furthermore, during the third quarter of 2023, the Company’s Swiss subsidiary was granted a ten-year tax incentive, beginning in 2024. The measurement of certain deferred tax assets and associated income tax benefits resulting from these transactions was impacted by tax legislation in Switzerland enacted in the fourth quarter of 2023, which increased the statutory income tax rate, resulting in additional deferred tax benefit impacts, net of valuation allowances. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the total income tax benefit recorded as a result of the intercompany transfers of intellectual property and tax incentive, all as described above, combined with other related additional current year tax expense as a result of the transactions, was approximately $2,080 million.\n On January 15, 2025, the OECD released Administrative Guidance (the “Guidance) on Article 9.1 of the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (the “Model Rules”) which amends the Pillar Two Framework. This Guidance may lead to an adjustment to the tax incentive granted to the Company’s Swiss subsidiary in 2023 under the terms of the incentive agreement and a reduction of deferred tax assets of up to approximately $300 million, net of valuation allowance. The Company is continuing to analyze the impacts of the Guidance and will recognize any resulting provisions in the first quarter of 2025.\nRefer to Note 14. Income Taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.\nEquity Loss\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nFavorable/\n(unfavorable)\n \n(in millions)\nEquity loss, net of tax\n$\n118 \n$\n299 \n$\n181 \nEquity loss, net of tax reflects the Company’s interest in the results of ongoing operations of entities accounted for as equity method investments. The decrease in equity losses recognized by Aptiv during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily attributable to the decrease in Aptiv’s common equity interest in Motional from 50% to approximately 15% as a result of the Motional funding and ownership restructuring transactions that were completed in May 2024. Refer to Note 5. Investments in Affiliates to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nWe operate our core business along the following operating segments, which are grouped on the basis of similar product, market and operating factors:\n•\nSignal and Power Solutions, which includes complete electrical architecture and component products.\n•\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience, which includes vehicle technology and services in advanced safety, user experience and smart vehicle compute and software, as well as cloud-native software platforms, autonomous driving technologies and DevOps tools.\n•\nEliminations and Other, which includes i) the elimination of inter-segment transactions, and ii) certain other expenses and income of a non-operating or strategic nature.\n47\nTable of Contents\nGenerally, Aptiv evaluates segment performance based on stand-alone segment net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax (expense) benefit, equity income (loss), net of tax, amortization, restructuring, other acquisition and portfolio project costs (which includes costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and to plan and execute product portfolio transformation actions, including business and product acquisitions and divestitures), asset impairments and other related charges, compensation expense related to acquisitions and gains (losses) on business divestitures and other transactions (“Adjusted Operating Income”). \nOur management utilizes Adjusted Operating Income as the key performance measure of segment income or loss to evaluate segment performance, and for planning and forecasting purposes to allocate resources to the segments, as management believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments. Segment Adjusted Operating Income should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income attributable to Aptiv, which is the most directly comparable financial measure to Adjusted Operating Income that is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment Adjusted Operating Income, as determined and measured by Aptiv, should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Refer to Note 22. Segment Reporting to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.\nNet sales, gross margin as a percentage of net sales and Adjusted Operating Income by segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nNet Sales by Segment\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nVariance Due To:\n \n2024\n2023\nFavorable/\n(unfavorable)\nVolume, net of contractual price reductions\nFX\nCommodity Pass-through\nOther\nTotal\n \n(in millions)\n(in millions)\nSignal and Power Solutions\n$\n13,983 \n$\n14,404 \n$\n(421)\n$\n(415)\n$\n(84)\n$\n78 \n$\n— \n$\n(421)\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience\n5,791 \n5,695 \n96 \n97 \n(1)\n— \n— \n96 \nEliminations and Other\n(61)\n(48)\n(13)\n(13)\n— \n— \n— \n(13)\nTotal\n$\n19,713 \n$\n20,051 \n$\n(338)\n$\n(331)\n$\n(85)\n$\n78 \n$\n— \n$\n(338)\nGross Margin Percentage by Segment\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nSignal and Power Solutions\n18.7 \n%\n18.0 \n%\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience\n19.0 \n%\n15.0 \n%\nTotal\n18.8 \n%\n17.2 \n%\nAdjusted Operating Income by Segment\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nVariance Due To:\n \n2024\n2023\nFavorable/\n(unfavorable)\nVolume, net of contractual price reductions\nOperational performance\nOther\nTotal\n \n(in millions)\n(in millions)\nSignal and Power Solutions\n$\n1,652 \n$\n1,676 \n$\n(24)\n$\n4 \n$\n86 \n$\n(114)\n$\n(24)\nAdvanced Safety and User Experience\n714 \n451 \n263 \n36 \n270 \n(43)\n263 \nAs noted in the table above, Adjusted Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was impacted by operational performance, volume, including product mix, as well as the impacts of \n48\nTable of Contents\nfavorable pricing, net of contractual price reductions, of $167 million. Adjusted Operating Income was also impacted by the following items included within Other in the table above:\n•\nApproximately $65 million of increased depreciation, primarily as a result of a higher fixed asset base;\n•\n$29 million of increased SG&A expense, not including the impact of other acquisition and portfolio project costs; \n•\nApproximately $40 million of increased costs due to customer volume-related inefficiencies and warranty matters; partially offset by\n•\n$17 million of favorable foreign currency impacts. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Capital Structure\nOur liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations, including capital expenditures and working capital requirements, as well as to fund debt service requirements and operational restructuring activities. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, our existing cash balance, and as necessary and available, borrowings under credit facilities and issuance of long-term debt and equity. To the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness, strategic acquisitions or investments, additional share repurchases and/or general corporate purposes. We also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 billion and net debt (defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents) of $6.8 billion. We also have access to additional liquidity pursuant to the terms of the $2.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility and the committed European accounts receivable factoring facility, as described below. The following table summarizes our available liquidity, which includes cash, cash equivalents and funds available under our significant committed credit facilities, as of December 31, 2024. \nDecember 31, 2024\n \n(in millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,573 \nRevolving Credit Facility, unutilized portion (1)\n1,998 \nCommitted European accounts receivable factoring facility, unutilized portion (2)\n18 \nTotal available liquidity\n$\n3,589 \n(1)\nAvailability reduced by $2 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.\n(2)\nBased on December 31, 2024 foreign currency rates, subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable.\nWe expect existing cash, available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities, including restructuring payments, capital expenditures and debt obligations. In addition, we expect to continue to repurchase outstanding ordinary shares pursuant to our authorized ordinary share repurchase program, as further described below.\nWe also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications, subject to current monetary policies. We utilize a combination of strategies, including dividends, cash pooling arrangements, intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Aptiv. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.5 billion. If additional non-U.S. cash was needed for our U.S. operations, we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.; however, based on our current liquidity needs and strategies, we do not anticipate a need to accrue and pay such additional amounts.\nBased on these factors, we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to fund our global operations and capital investments in 2025 and beyond.\nShare Repurchase Programs\nIn July 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $5.0 billion of ordinary shares, which commenced in August 2024 following completion of the Company’s $2.0 billion January 2019 share repurchase program. This share repurchase program provides for share purchases in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions (which may \n49\nTable of Contents\ninclude derivative transactions, including an accelerated share repurchase program (“ASR”)), depending on share price, market conditions and other factors, as determined by the Company.\nAs part of the Company’s share repurchase program, on August 1, 2024, the Company entered into ASR agreements with each of Goldman Sachs International and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to repurchase an aggregate of $3.0 billion of Aptiv’s ordinary shares (the “ASR Agreements”).\nUnder the terms of the ASR Agreements, on August 2, 2024, the Company made an aggregate payment of $3.0 billion (the “Repurchase Price”) and received initial deliveries of approximately 30.8 million ordinary shares with a value of $2.25 billion, which were retired immediately and recorded as a reduction to shareholders’ equity. Aptiv incurred approximately $4 million of direct costs in connection with the ASR Agreements. Given the Company’s ability to settle in shares, as described below, the remaining $750 million prepaid forward contract was classified as a reduction to additional paid-in capital as of December 31, 2024. In January 2025, a portion of the ASR Agreements were settled, and Aptiv received approximately 5.6 million ordinary shares, which were retired immediately. \nThe Company initially funded the accelerated share repurchase program with cash on hand and borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement. The Bridge Credit Agreement was subsequently repaid and terminated during the third quarter of 2024 using proceeds from the Term Loan A and issuance of the 2024 Senior Notes and 2024 Junior Notes, as further described in Note 11. Debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein.\nThe total number of shares to be repurchased under each ASR Agreement will be based on the average daily volume-weighted average price of our ordinary shares on specified dates during the term of such ASR Agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements.\nUpon final settlement of the ASR Agreements, under certain circumstances, the relevant counterparty may be required to deliver additional ordinary shares, or we may be required to deliver ordinary shares or to make a cash payment to the relevant counterparty, at our election. The final settlements under the ASR Agreements are scheduled to occur no later than the second quarter of 2025, and in each case may be accelerated at the option of the applicable counterparty.\nA summary of the ordinary shares repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nTotal number of shares repurchased\n44,431,332 \n4,701,558 \nAverage price paid per share\n$\n75.40 \n$\n84.59 \nTotal (in millions)\n$\n3,350 \n$\n398 \nThere were no shares repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $2,515 million of share repurchases remained available under the July 2024 share repurchase program. All previously repurchased shares were retired, and are reflected as a reduction of ordinary share capital for the par value of the shares, with the excess applied as reductions to additional paid-in-capital and retained earnings.\nDividends from Equity Investments\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Aptiv received dividends of $12 million, $5 million and $5 million, respectively, from its equity method investments. The dividends were recognized as a reduction to the investment and represented a return on investment included in cash flows from operating activities.\nAcquisitions and Other Transactions\nHöhle\n—On April 3, 2023, Aptiv acquired 100% of the equity interests of Höhle Ltd. (“Höhle”), a manufacturer of microducts, for total consideration of $42 million. The results of operations of Höhle are reported within the Signal and Power Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. The Company acquired Höhle utilizing cash on hand.\nWind River\n—On December 23, 2022, Aptiv acquired 100% of the equity interests of Wind River, a global leader in delivering software for the intelligent edge, for total consideration of approximately $3.5 billion. The results of operations of Wind River are reported within the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment from the date of acquisition. The Company acquired Wind River utilizing cash on hand, which included proceeds from the 2022 Senior Notes. Upon completion of the acquisition, Aptiv incurred transaction related expenses totaling approximately $43 million, which were recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nIntercable Automotive\n—On November 30, 2022, Aptiv acquired 85% of the equity interests of Intercable Automotive Solutions S.r.l. (“Intercable Automotive”), a manufacturer of high-voltage busbars and interconnect solutions, for total consideration of $609 million. The results of operations of Intercable Automotive are reported within the Signal and Power \n50\nTable of Contents\nSolutions segment from the date of acquisition. The Company acquired its interest in Intercable Automotive utilizing cash on hand. Upon completion of the acquisition, Aptiv incurred transaction related expenses totaling approximately $10 million, which were recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nConcurrent with the acquisition, the Company entered into an agreement with the noncontrolling interest holders that provides the Company with the right to purchase, and the noncontrolling interest holders with the right to sell, the remaining 15% of Intercable Automotive for cash of up to €155 million, beginning in 2026. The final purchase price is contractually defined and will be determined based on Intercable Automotive’s 2025 operating results.\nSale of Interest in Majority Owned Russian Subsidiary\n—Given the sanctions put in place by the E.U., U.S. and other governments, which restrict our ability to conduct business in Russia, we initiated a plan in the second quarter of 2022 to exit our 51% owned subsidiary in Russia. As a result, the Company determined that this subsidiary, which was reported within the Signal and Power Solutions segment, initially met the held for sale criteria as of June 30, 2022. Consequently, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $51 million to impair the carrying value of the Russian subsidiary’s net assets to fair value.\nOn May 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its entire interest in the Russian subsidiary to JSC Samara Cables Company, the sole minority shareholder in the Russian subsidiary, for a nominal amount in exchange for all of the Company’s shares in the subsidiary. As a result of this transaction, the net assets held for sale of the Russian subsidiary were deconsolidated from the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the Company did not record any incremental gain or loss resulting from this disposition. Furthermore, losses relating to the Russian subsidiary during the held for sale period were de minimis. The former Russian subsidiary is not considered to be a related party of the Company after deconsolidation.\nRefer to Note 20. Acquisitions and Divestitures to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further detail of the Company’s business acquisitions and divestitures.\nMotional Joint Venture Funding and Ownership Restructuring Transactions\nOn April 19, 2024, Aptiv and Hyundai Motor Group (“Hyundai”) entered into an agreement to restructure Aptiv’s ownership interest in Motional and for Hyundai to provide additional funding to Motional, each as described below. Prior to these transactions, Motional was 50% owned by each of Aptiv and Hyundai. \nAs part of the agreement, on May 2, 2024, Hyundai invested $475 million in Motional AD LLC (“Motional”) in exchange for an additional 11.7% common equity interest. Aptiv did not participate in this funding round. This transaction resulted in the dilution of Aptiv’s common equity interest in Motional from 50% to approximately 44%, prior to the completion of any further transactions as described below. As these units were issued at a valuation greater than the carrying value of our investment in Motional, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $91 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, within net gain on equity method transactions in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAlso as part of the agreement, on May 16, 2024, Aptiv sold 11% of its common equity interest in Motional to Hyundai for approximately $448 million of cash consideration. Aptiv also exchanged approximately 21% of its common equity in Motional for a like number of Motional preferred shares. These transactions resulted in the reduction of Aptiv’s common equity interest in Motional from approximately 44% to approximately 15%. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $550 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, within net gain on equity method transactions in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe total gain recorded as a result of the Motional funding and ownership restructuring transactions completed in May 2024, all as described above, was approximately $641 million ($2.50 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nInvestment in TTTech Auto\n—On March 15, 2022, Aptiv acquired approximately 20% of the equity interests of TTTech Auto AG (“TTTech Auto”), a leading provider of safety-critical middleware solutions for advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving applications, for €200 million (approximately $220 million, using foreign currency rates on the investment date). The Company made the investment in TTTech Auto utilizing cash on hand.\nThe shareholders of TTTech Auto entered into an agreement for the sale of 100% of TTTech Auto to an unrelated third party. As a result, the Company determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment to its equity method investment in TTTech Auto in the fourth quarter of 2024 based on the anticipated acquisition value of TTTech Auto. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s equity investment in TTTech Auto was written down to its estimated fair value of $147 million, resulting in a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $36 million within net gain on equity method transactions in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon completion of the sale, Aptiv will no longer hold an equity interest in TTTech Auto. The sale is anticipated to occur in 2025 and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.\n51\nTable of Contents\nTechnology Investments\n—In September 2024, the Company’s Advanced Safety and User Experience segment made an investment totaling approximately 399 million Chinese Yuan Renminbi (“RMB”) (approximately $57 million, using foreign currency rates on the investment date) in preferred equity of MAXIEYE Automotive Technology (Ningbo) Co., Ltd. (“Maxieye”), a provider of advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving applications. Due to the Company’s redemption rights, the Company’s investment in Maxieye is classified as an available-for-sale debt security within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company also agreed to invest an additional 171 million RMB (approximately $24 million, using December 31, 2024 foreign currency rates) in preferred equity of Maxieye, contingent on the achievement of certain technical milestones, which have not yet been met as of December 31, 2024, and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. \nIn July 2024, the Company’s Advanced Safety and User Experience segment made an investment of approximately 33 billion Korean Won (“KRW”) (approximately $24 million, using foreign currency rates on the investment date) in convertible redeemable preferred shares of StradVision, Inc. (“StradVision”), a provider of deep learning-based camera perception software for automotive applications. The Company previously made KRW-denominated investments in StradVision totaling approximately $40 million in the first quarter of 2024 and approximately $44 million in prior years (using foreign currency rates on the date of the respective investments). Due to the Company’s redemption rights, the Company’s investment in StradVision is classified as an available-for-sale debt security within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income. \nRefer to Note 5. Investments in Affiliates to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further detail of the Company’s investments.\nCredit Agreement\nAptiv PLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary Aptiv Corporation entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with, among others, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), under which it maintains a senior unsecured credit facility currently consisting of a revolving credit facility of $2 billion (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility matures on June 24, 2026. Aptiv Global Financing Designated Activity Company (“AGF DAC,” formerly known as Aptiv Global Financing Limited), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aptiv PLC, previously executed a joinder agreement to the Credit Agreement, which allows it to act as a borrower under the Credit Agreement, and a guaranty supplement, under which AGF DAC guarantees the obligations under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. As a result of the reorganization transaction, Aptiv Swiss Holdings replaced Old Aptiv as an obligor under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement was entered into in March 2011 and has been subsequently amended and restated on several occasions, most recently on June 24, 2021, and was further amended on April 19, 2023. The June 2021 amendment, among other things, (1) refinanced and replaced the term loan A and revolver with a new term loan A with an original maturity in 2026, and a new five-year revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $2 billion, (2) utilized the Company’s existing sustainability-linked metrics and commitments, that, if achieved, would change the facility fee and interest rate margins as described below, and (3) established the leverage ratio maintenance covenant that requires the Company to maintain total net leverage (as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement) of less than 3.5 to 1.0 (or 4.0 to 1.0 for four full fiscal quarters following completion of material acquisitions, as defined in the Credit Agreement) and allowed for dividends and other payments on equity. Effective from the date of the April 2023 amendment, all interest rate benchmarks within the Credit Agreement that were previously based on the London Interbank Offered Rate were transitioned to a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature that permits Aptiv to increase, from time to time, the aggregate borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $1 billion upon Aptiv’s request, the agreement of the lenders participating in the increase, and the approval of the Administrative Agent. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are prepayable at Aptiv’s option without premium or penalty.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Aptiv had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $2 million in letters of credit were issued under the Credit Agreement. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement reduce availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. No amounts were drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at Aptiv’s option, at either (a) the Administrative Agent’s Alternate Base Rate (“ABR” as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (b) SOFR plus in either case a percentage per annum as set forth in the table below (the “Applicable Rate”). The rates under the Credit Agreement on the specified dates are set forth below:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nSOFR plus\nABR plus\nSOFR plus\nABR plus\nRevolving Credit Facility\n1.06 \n%\n0.06 \n%\n1.06 \n%\n0.06 \n%\n52\nTable of Contents\nThe Applicable Rate under the Credit Agreement, as well as the facility fee, may increase or decrease from time to time based on changes in the Company’s credit ratings and whether the Company achieves or fails to achieve certain sustainability-linked targets with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and workplace safety. Such adjustments may be up to 0.04% per annum on interest rate margins on the Revolving Credit Facility, 0.02% per annum on interest rate margins on the Tranche A Term Loan (prior to its repayment, as described above) and 0.01% per annum on the facility fee. Accordingly, the interest rate is subject to fluctuation during the term of the Credit Agreement based on changes in the ABR, SOFR, changes in the Company’s corporate credit ratings or whether the Company achieves or fails to achieve its sustainability-linked targets. The Credit Agreement also requires that Aptiv pay certain facility fees on the Revolving Credit Facility, which are also subject to adjustment based on the sustainability-linked targets as described above, and certain letter of credit issuance and fronting fees. The Company achieved the sustainability-linked targets for the 2023 calendar year, and the interest rate margins and facility fees were reduced from the Applicable Rates, by the amounts specified above, effective in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Company’s (and the Company’s subsidiaries’) ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or liens or to dispose of substantially all of its assets. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 3.5 to 1.0 (or 4.0 to 1.0 for four full fiscal quarters following completion of material acquisitions, as defined in the Credit Agreement).\nThe Credit Agreement also contains events of default customary for financings of this type. The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants as of December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, all obligations under the Credit Agreement were borrowed by Aptiv Corporation and jointly and severally guaranteed by AGF DAC, Aptiv PLC and Aptiv Swiss Holdings, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement.\nPreviously, the Company also maintained a senior unsecured credit facility in the form of a term loan (the “Tranche A Term Loan”). On October 27, 2023, the Company fully repaid the outstanding principal balance of $301 million on the Tranche A Term Loan, utilizing cash on hand. As a result, Aptiv recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTerm Loan A Credit Agreement\nOn August 19, 2024, Aptiv PLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries AGF DAC and Aptiv Corporation entered into a new senior unsecured term loan A credit agreement (the “Term Loan A Credit Agreement”) with, among others, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, under which it maintains a senior unsecured credit facility consisting of a term loan (the “Term Loan A”) in aggregate principal amount of $600 million. Aptiv incurred approximately $2 million of issuance costs in connection with the Term Loan A.\nProceeds from the Term Loan A were used to repay a portion of the loans incurred under the Bridge Credit Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This transaction was accounted for as a modification of debt in accordance with ASC Topic 470-50, \nDebt Modifications and Extinguishments\n. Accordingly, a pro-rata portion of the unamortized fees from the Bridge Credit Agreement in the amount of $4 million was transferred to the Term Loan A and, together with the $2 million of direct issuance costs referenced above, will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the Term Loan A. \nOn December 20, 2024, the Company repaid $350 million of the outstanding principal balance on the Term Loan A, utilizing cash on hand. As a result, Aptiv recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  \nThe Term Loan A matures on August 19, 2027. Borrowings under the Term Loan A Credit Agreement are prepayable at Aptiv’s option without premium or penalty. No principal payment is required until the outstanding principal amount is due in full on the maturity date. In the first quarter of 2025, the Company fully repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance of $250 million on the Term Loan A, utilizing cash on hand. \nLoans under the Term Loan A Credit Agreement bear interest, at Aptiv’s option, at either (a) ABR or (b) SOFR plus in either case a percentage per annum as set forth in the table below (the “Term Loan Applicable Rate”). The rates under the Term Loan A Credit Agreement on the specified dates are set forth below:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nSOFR plus\nABR plus\nSOFR plus\nABR plus\nTerm Loan A\n1.25 \n%\n0.25 \n%\nN/A\nN/A\nThe Term Loan Applicable Rate under the Term Loan A Credit Agreement may increase or decrease from time to time based on changes in the Company’s credit ratings. The interest rate is subject to fluctuation during the term of the Term Loan A Credit Agreement based on changes in the ABR, SOFR or changes in the Company’s corporate credit ratings. \n53\nTable of Contents\nThe interest rate period with respect to SOFR interest rate options can be set at one-, three-, or six-months as selected by Aptiv in accordance with the terms of the Term Loan A Credit Agreement (or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders). Aptiv may elect to change the selected interest rate option in accordance with the provisions of the Term Loan A Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, Aptiv selected the one-month SOFR interest rate option on the Term Loan A, and the rate effective as of December 31, 2024, as detailed in the table below, was based on the Company’s current credit rating and the Term Loan Applicable Rate for the Term Loan A Credit Agreement:\nBorrowings as of\nTerm Loan\nDecember 31, 2024\nRates effective as of\nApplicable Rate\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nTerm Loan A\nSOFR plus 1.25%\n$\n250 \n5.72 \n%\nThe Term Loan A Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Company’s (and the Company’s subsidiaries’) ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or liens or to dispose of substantially all of its assets. In addition, the Term Loan A Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Term Loan A Credit Agreement) of not more than 3.5 to 1.0 (or 4.0 to 1.0 for four full fiscal quarters following completion of material acquisitions, as defined in the Term Loan A Credit Agreement).\nThe Term Loan A Credit Agreement also contains events of default customary for financings of this type. The Company was in compliance with the Term Loan A Credit Agreement covenants as of December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, all obligations under the Term Loan A Credit Agreement were borrowed by AGF DAC and jointly and severally guaranteed by Aptiv PLC, Aptiv Corporation and Aptiv Swiss Holdings.\nSenior and Junior Unsecured Notes\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had the following senior and junior unsecured notes issued and outstanding:\nAggregate Principal Amount\n(in millions)\nStated Coupon Rate\nIssuance Date\nMaturity Date\nInterest Payment Date\n$\n520 \n1.60%\nSeptember 2016\nSeptember 2028\nSeptember 15\n$\n300 \n4.35%\nMarch 2019\nMarch 2029\nMarch 15 and September 15\n$\n550 \n4.65%\nSeptember 2024\nSeptember 2029\nMarch 13 and September 13\n$\n800 \n3.25%\nFebruary 2022\nMarch 2032\nMarch 1 and September 1\n$\n550 \n5.15%\nSeptember 2024\nSeptember 2034\nMarch 13 and September 13\n$\n781 \n4.25%\nJune 2024\nJune 2036\nJune 11\n$\n300 \n4.40%\nSeptember 2016\nOctober 2046\nApril 1 and October 1\n$\n350 \n5.40%\nMarch 2019\nMarch 2049\nMarch 15 and September 15\n$\n1,500 \n3.10%\nNovember 2021\nDecember 2051\nJune 1 and December 1\n$\n1,000 \n4.15%\nFebruary 2022\nMay 2052\nMay 1 and November 1\n$\n550 \n5.75%\nSeptember 2024\nSeptember 2054\nMarch 13 and September 13\n$\n500 \n6.875% (1)\nSeptember 2024\nDecember 2054\nJune 15 and December 15\n(1)\nRepresents fixed-to-fixed reset rate junior subordinated unsecured notes.\nAlthough the specific terms of each indenture governing each series of senior and junior notes vary, the senior indentures contain certain restrictive covenants, including with respect to Aptiv’s (and Aptiv’s subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge with or into other entities. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the provisions of all series of the outstanding senior and junior notes. Refer to Note 11. Debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.\n54\nTable of Contents\nGuarantor Summarized Financial Information\nAs further described in Note 11. Debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein, Aptiv PLC, Aptiv Corporation, AGF DAC and Aptiv Swiss Holdings are each potential borrowers under the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan A Credit Agreement, under which such borrowings would be guaranteed by each of the other entities. Old Aptiv issued the 2016 Euro-denominated Senior Notes, 2016 Senior Notes, 2019 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. In February 2022, Aptiv Corporation and AGF DAC were added as guarantors on each series of outstanding senior notes previously issued by Old Aptiv. AGF DAC was added as a joint and several co-issuer of the 2021 Senior Notes in December 2021, effective as of the date of issuance. Old Aptiv and Aptiv Corporation jointly issued the 2022 Senior Notes, which are guaranteed by AGF DAC. In 2024, Old Aptiv and AGF DAC jointly issued the 2024 Euro-denominated Senior Notes, the 2024 Senior Notes, and the 2024 Junior Notes, which are all guaranteed by Aptiv Corporation. In December 2024, with respect to each series of outstanding senior and junior notes previously issued by Old Aptiv, Aptiv Swiss Holdings succeeded to Old Aptiv as obligor, and Aptiv PLC was added as a guarantor. Together, Aptiv PLC, Aptiv Corporation, AGF DAC and Aptiv Swiss Holdings comprise the “Obligor Group.” All other consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries of Aptiv PLC are not subject to any guarantee under any series of notes outstanding (the “Non-Guarantors”). The guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, are effectively subordinated to any of their existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness of each of their existing and future subsidiaries that is not a guarantor.\nThe below summarized financial information is presented on a combined basis after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions among the Obligor Group and equity in earnings from and investments in the Non-Guarantors. The below summarized financial information should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included herein, as the financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the subsidiaries operated as independent entities.\nObligor Group\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n(in millions)\nNet sales\n$\n— \nGross margin\n$\n— \nOperating loss\n$\n(10)\nNet loss\n$\n(197)\nNet loss attributable to Aptiv\n$\n(197)\nAs of December 31, 2024\nCurrent assets (1)\n$\n6,969 \nLong-term assets (1)\n$\n692 \nCurrent liabilities (2)\n$\n5,683 \nLong-term liabilities (2)\n$\n8,126 \nNoncontrolling interest\n$\n— \nAs of December 31, 2023\nCurrent assets (1)\n$\n4,699 \nLong-term assets (1)\n$\n562 \nCurrent liabilities (2)\n$\n6,090 \nLong-term liabilities (2)\n$\n6,419 \nNoncontrolling interest\n$\n— \n(1)\nIncludes current assets of $6,212 million and $3,826 million, and long-term assets of $687 million and $555 million, due from Non-Guarantors as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes current liabilities of $5,481 million and $6,013 million, and long-term liabilities of $226 million and $226 million, due to Non-Guarantors as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n55\nTable of Contents\nOther Financing\nReceivable factoring\n—Aptiv maintains a €450 million European accounts receivable factoring facility that is available on a committed basis and allows for factoring of receivables denominated in both Euros and U.S. dollars (“USD”). This facility is accounted for as short-term debt and borrowings are subject to the availability of eligible accounts receivable. Collateral is not required related to these trade accounts receivable. This facility became effective on January 1, 2021 and had an initial term of three years, and was renewed for an additional three year term, effective November 2023, subject to Aptiv’s right to terminate at any time with three months’ notice. After expiration of the new three-year term, either party can terminate with three months’ notice. Borrowings denominated in Euros under the facility bear interest at the three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) plus 0.50% and USD borrowings bear interest at two-month SOFR plus 0.50%, with borrowings under either denomination carrying a minimum interest rate of 0.20%. As of December 31, 2024, Aptiv had $450 million outstanding under the European accounts receivable factoring facility. As of December 31, 2023, Aptiv had no amounts outstanding under the European accounts receivable factoring facility. The maximum amount drawn under the European accounts receivable factoring facility during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $450 million, primarily to manage intra-month working capital requirements.\nFinance leases and other\n—As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $64 million and $21 million, respectively, of other debt primarily issued by certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and finance lease obligations were outstanding.\nLetter of credit facilities\n—In addition to the letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, Aptiv had approximately $4 million outstanding through other letter of credit facilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, primarily to support arrangements and other obligations at certain of its subsidiaries.\nContractual Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments as of December 31, 2024, with amounts denominated in foreign currencies translated using foreign currency rates as of December 31, 2024. We have not included information on our recurring purchases of materials for use in our manufacturing operations. These amounts are generally consistent from year to year, closely reflect our levels of production, and are not long-term in nature. The amounts below exclude the gross liability for uncertain tax positions of $227 million as of December 31, 2024. We do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months. We are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the non-current portion of obligations associated with uncertain tax positions.

We have minimum funding requirements with respect to certain of our pension obligations and may periodically elect to make discretionary contributions to the plans in support of risk management initiatives. We will also have payments due with respect to our other postretirement benefit obligations. We do not fund our other postretirement benefit obligations and payments are made as costs are incurred by covered retirees. Refer to Note 12. Pension Benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional detail regarding our expected contributions to our pension plans and expected distributions to participants in future periods.\nCapital Expenditures\nSupplier selection in the automotive industry is generally finalized several years prior to the start of production of the vehicle. Therefore, current capital expenditures are based on customer commitments entered into previously, generally several years ago when the customer contract was awarded. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $194 million in \n56\nTable of Contents\noutstanding cancellable and non-cancellable capital commitments.

Due to this cycle of cash flows, we may utilize short-term financing, including our Revolving Credit Facility and European accounts receivable factoring facility, to manage our intra-month working capital needs. Our cash balance typically peaks at month end.\nWe utilize a combination of strategies, including dividends, cash pooling arrangements, intercompany loan structures and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs. We utilize a global cash pooling arrangement to consolidate and manage our global cash balances, which enables us to efficiently move cash into and out of a number of the countries in which we operate.\nOperating activities\n—Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,446 million and $1,896 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted primarily of net earnings of $1,810 million, increased by $1,023 million for non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization, pension costs and extinguishment of debt, partially offset by $605 million for non-cash net gains on equity method transactions and $16 million related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of restructuring and pension contributions. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of net earnings of $2,966 million, increased by $956 million for non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and pension costs, partially offset by $2,164 million related to non-cash changes in deferred income taxes, primarily resulting from the tax benefit associated with the intercompany transfers of certain intellectual property, and $293 million related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of restructuring and pension contributions.\nInvesting activities\n—Net cash used in investing activities totaled $507 million and $1,002 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $830 million and technology investments of $121 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of equity method investments of $448 million. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $906 million.\nFinancing activities\n—Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,965 million and $807 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily included $4,104 million paid to repurchase ordinary shares, $1,440 million for the repayment of senior notes and $350 million for the partial repayment of the Term Loan A, partially offset by net proceeds of $2,920 million received from the issuance of senior and junior notes, net proceeds of $598 million received from the issuance of the Term Loan A and $454 million for borrowings under other short-term debt agreements. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily included $398 million paid to repurchase ordinary shares, $309 million in repayments of term loans and $32 million of MCPS dividend payments.\n57\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not engage in any off-balance sheet financial arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n•\nIt requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate, and\n•\nChanges in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAcquisitions and Other Transactions\nIn accordance with the accounting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, \nBusiness Combinations\n, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. The process to estimate fair value described herein is generally applicable to other transactions, including the fair value estimates used in establishing the identifiable assets, liabilities and goodwill recorded upon formation of Motional, Aptiv’s autonomous driving joint venture, and the resulting equity method investment recorded on Aptiv’s balance sheet.\nAn acquisition may include a contingent consideration component. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part of the purchase price. This estimate is updated in future periods and any changes in the estimate, which are not considered an adjustment to the purchase price, are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAn acquisition may also include a redeemable noncontrolling interest component. The fair value of the noncontrolling interest is recorded to temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheet and is estimated as of the date of acquisition using a Monte Carlo simulation approach, which includes several assumptions including estimated future profitability, expected volatility rate and risk free rate. The redeemable noncontrolling interest is then adjusted each reporting period for the income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest, and for any measurement period adjustments necessary to record the redeemable noncontrolling interest at the higher of its redemption value, assuming it was redeemable at the reporting date, or its carrying value. Any measurement period adjustments are recorded to retained earnings, with a corresponding increase or reduction to net income attributable to Aptiv.\nWe use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.\nOur purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies.\nOther estimates used in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, future cash flows or income related to intangibles, market rate assumptions, actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain, and therefore, may not be realized. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially.\n58\nTable of Contents\nWarranty Obligations and Product Recall Costs\nEstimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold. We base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts, combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers. The key factors which impact our estimates are (1) the stated or implied warranty period; (2) OEM source; (3) OEM policy decisions regarding warranty claims; and (4) OEMs seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties. These estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis. Actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\nIn addition to our ordinary warranty provisions with customers, we are also at risk for product recall costs, which are costs incurred when a customer or the Company recalls a product through a formal campaign soliciting return of that product. In addition, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) has the authority, under certain circumstances, to require recalls to remedy safety concerns. Product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall, including labor to remove and replace the recalled part. The Company accrues for costs related to product recalls as part of our warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Actual costs incurred could differ from the amounts estimated, requiring adjustments to these reserves in future periods. It is possible that changes in our assumptions or future product recall issues could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nWe are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims, including commercial or contractual disputes, product liability claims, government investigations, product warranties and environmental and other matters, that arise in the normal course of business. We routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses, by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters. We have accrued for estimated losses for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred, is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters. The amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution. Refer to Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.\nRestructuring\nAccruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions. These accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs, contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes. Actual costs may vary from these estimates. These accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified.\nPensions\nWe use actuarial estimates and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense. We are required to select certain actuarial assumptions, which are determined based on current market conditions, historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers. Refer to Note 12. Pension Benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details. The key factors which impact our estimates are (1) discount rates; (2) asset return assumptions; and (3) actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Experience gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are recognized in other comprehensive income. Cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) for a particular plan are amortized over the average future service period of the employees in that plan.\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans were:\nAssumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:\n \nPension Benefits\n \nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nWeighted-average discount rate\n4.90 \n%\n5.50 \n%\n6.23 \n%\n5.91 \n%\nWeighted-average rate of increase in compensation levels\nN/A\nN/A\n2.66 \n%\n2.93 \n%\nAssumptions used to determine net expense for years ended December 31:\n \nPension Benefits\n \nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWeighted-average discount rate\n5.50 \n%\n5.20 \n%\n1.90 \n%\n5.91 \n%\n5.95 \n%\n3.09 \n%\nWeighted-average rate of increase in compensation levels\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n2.93 \n%\n2.82 \n%\n2.47 \n%\nWeighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n5.18 \n%\n4.98 \n%\n4.46 \n%\nWe select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments rated AA or higher by Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s.\nAptiv does not have any U.S. pension assets; therefore no U.S. asset rate of return calculation was necessary. The primary funded non-U.S. plans are in the U.K. and Mexico. For the determination of 2024 expense, we assumed a long-term expected asset rate of return of approximately 4.50% and 8.00% for the U.K. and Mexico, respectively. We evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers, including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns, in developing the long-term rate of return assumptions. The assumptions for the U.K. and Mexico are primarily conservative long-term, prospective rates. To determine the expected return on plan assets, the market-related value of our plan assets is actual fair value.\nOur pension expense for 2025 is determined at the December 31, 2024 measurement date. For purposes of analysis, the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense attributable to changes in key assumptions:\nChange in Assumption\nImpact on Pension Expense\nImpact on PBO\n25 basis point (“bp”) decrease in discount rate\nLess than + $1 million\n‘\n+ $15 million\n25 bp increase in discount rate\nLess than + $1 million\n‘\n- $15 million\n25 bp decrease in long-term expected return on assets\n‘\n+ $1 million\n—\n25 bp increase in long-term expected return on assets\n‘\n- $1 million\n—\nThe above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. The above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs.\nBased on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers, we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 12. Pension Benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Investments in Affiliates and Expected Useful Lives\nWe monitor our long-lived and definite-lived assets, including our investments in affiliates, the most significant of which is our investment in Motional AD LLC, for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future cash flows, including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets. Even if an impairment charge is \n60\nTable of Contents\nnot required, a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets. We estimate cash flows and fair value through review of appraisals and using internal budgets based on recent sales data, independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments. The key factors which impact our estimates are (1) future production estimates; (2) customer preferences and decisions; (3) product pricing; (4) manufacturing and material cost estimates; and (5) product life / business retention. Any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values, which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition. We believe that the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe periodically review goodwill for impairment indicators. We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The Company performs the goodwill impairment review at the reporting unit level. We perform a qualitative assessment (step 0) of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is performed. If so, we perform the step 1 test discussed hereafter. Our qualitative assessment involves significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, financial performance of the Company, reporting unit specific events and changes in the Company’s share price. \nIf the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount (step 1), goodwill is not considered to be impaired. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a future discounted cash flow valuation model and, if possible, a comparable market transaction model. Estimating fair value requires the Company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates, growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company must record an impairment charge based on the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nManagement performed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company completed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment (step 0) and, after evaluating the results, events and circumstances of the Company, we concluded that sufficient evidence existed to assert qualitatively that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of all but our Wind River reporting unit remained substantially in excess of their carrying values. As such, the Company completed a quantitative goodwill impairment test (step 1) for its Wind River reporting unit within the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment, which has goodwill of $2,279 million, and determined its fair value to be in excess of its carrying value by less than 1%. The estimated fair value of this reporting unit was primarily determined using discounted cash flow projections. Significant assumptions included management’s forecasted cash flows, including estimated future revenue growth and the discount rate. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on management’s best estimates. The discount rate was determined using a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk factors specific to the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows, including changes in the projected revenue and the discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the reporting unit. \nAlthough we believe our estimate of fair value is reasonable based on current and future market conditions and the best information available at the impairment assessment date, the reporting unit’s future financial performance is dependent on our ability to execute our business plan. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates used in our impairment testing for goodwill, including discount rates and cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair value. A reduction in the estimated fair value could result in non-cash impairment charges in a future period. For example, an increase in the discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would result in the fair value of the reporting unit being approximately 7%, or $230 million, below its carrying value. A 5% decrease in the estimated annual revenues used in the analysis would result in the fair value of the reporting unit being approximately 5%, or $170 million, below its carrying value. These sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. \nWe review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Similar to the goodwill assessment described above, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If necessary, the Company then performs a quantitative impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset, based upon its forecasted cash flows, to its carrying value. Other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment testing only if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired, as described above.\n61\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods.\nWhen establishing a valuation allowance, we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies.” A tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that: is prudent and feasible; an enterprise ordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused; and would result in realization of deferred tax assets.” In the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability. Changes in our estimates, due to unforeseen events or otherwise, could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. We use a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We report tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate.
