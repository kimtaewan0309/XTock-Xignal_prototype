Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “SBUX.” We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea, and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items through company-operated stores (“stores” or “coffeehouses”). We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels, such as licensed stores as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé S.A. (“Nestlé”). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee\n®\n brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana\n®\n, Ethos\n®\n, and Starbucks Reserve\n®\n.\nOur primary objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. We believe the continuous investments in our brand and operations will deliver long-term targeted revenue and income growth. This includes expansion of our global store base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S. and in higher growth markets, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores around the world. In addition, by leveraging experiences gained through our stores and elsewhere, we continue to drive beverage, equipment, process, and technology innovation, including in our industry-leading digital platform. We strive to regularly offer consumers new, innovative coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories and diverse channels. \nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we announced our \n“\nBack to Starbucks\n”\n strategy, which was implemented with the goal to bring new and existing customers to our stores and business, and return to growth. The strategy\n includes supporting our green apron partners, enhancing the customer experience, reestablishing ourselves as the community coffeehouse, and strengthening the brand through product development, marketing, in-store and digital experience. This strategic reset provides us with the opportunity to assess the business and refocus our efforts, including capital allocation priorities, efficiency efforts, and store growth initiatives. \nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we announced a restructuring plan involving the closure of coffeehouses, and the further transformation of our support organization, as part of the Company’s “Back to Starbucks” strategy. We assessed our existing store portfolio with respect to both whether coffeehouses had a viable path to offering the physical environment consistent with the brand and a clear path to financial performance and we closed, or plan to close, the coffeehouses that did not meet these criteria. \nRefer to \nNote 18\n, Restructuring, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe invest in the well-being – the mental, physical, and financial health – of every partner through our practices, policies, and benefits. This work is grounded in the belief that we are at our best when we create inclusive, supportive, and welcoming environments, where we uplift one another with dignity, respect, and kindness. We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global brand that leads with purpose. Therefore, one of our core strategies is to invest in, and support, our partners to differentiate our brand, products, and services in the competitive specialty coffee market, including the following areas of focus:\nOversight and Management\nWe believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures that is reflective of our customers, partners, and communities. Working under these principles, our Partner Resources Organization is tasked with managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, performance management, and professional development. Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters. As noted in its charter, our Compensation and Management Development Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing Starbucks partner resource programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices and strategies. Our Audit and Compliance Committee works closely with the Risk Steering Committee, led by Starbucks chief financial officer (“cfo”) and chief legal officer, to monitor and mitigate current and emerging labor and human capital management risks. The Board, through its committees, annually reviews and assesses the effectiveness of the Company’s \n3\nTable of Contents\nenvironmental and social strategies, policies, practices, goals, programs, disclosure, and risks, including review of the Company’s annual global impact report.\nThese reports and recommendations to the Board and its committees are part of the broader framework that guides how Starbucks should attract, retain, and develop a skilled workforce that aligns with our values and strategies.\nWe regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our partners on a variety of topics, including confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities, and recommendations on how we can remain an employer of choice. The results are shared with our partners and reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in partner engagement. Our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues such as partner retention, workplace safety, harassment, and bullying, as well as to implement measures to mitigate these issues.\nBelonging at Starbucks \nAt Starbucks, we are committed to creating environments where everyone is welcome and belongs. In 2023, led by Starbucks partners, we reaffirmed this commitment by cementing “Belonging” as one of our company values.  \nWe are dedicated to being an inclusive, accessible and diverse company, with a deep commitment to opportunity for every one of our partners by making Starbucks the best job in retail and a great place to build a career.  \nStarbucks programs and benefits are open to every partner and designed to strengthen a culture of inclusion that values diverse perspectives and experiences – from strong partner networks to a focus on hiring internally for 90% of retail leadership roles. Our hiring and recruiting practices are competitive, fair and inclusive. They help us hire the strongest candidate for every job, every time.  We offer industry-leading benefits, competitive pay, and opportunities for learning and development. When our partners feel good about their future – at Starbucks or beyond – they take care of our customers. Investing in them and prioritizing their experience creates value for everyone. \nTotal Rewards\nWe have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages by continuously assessing the current business environment and labor market. We have consistently made enhancements in wages in order to attract talent to support our growth strategy and to elevate the customer experience. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of partners with shareholders, restricted stock units are provided to eligible non-executive partners under our broad-based stock incentive programs. Furthermore, we offer competitive pay and a collection of benefits that are best in class. Partners in the U.S., which is our largest and most mature market, can:\n•\nGrow their careers with us. We established a goal to fill 90% of retail leadership roles internally, creating a way for our hourly partners to build a career at Starbucks.\n•\nGet a college degree, on us. Through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan (SCAP), Starbucks covers 100% of tuition for a first-time online bachelor’s degree from Arizona State University for partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week.\n•\nGrow their savings. In fiscal 2025, more than 230,000 partners received a Bean Stock grant giving them an ownership stake in Starbucks.\n•\nObtain comprehensive healthcare coverage. We offer industry-leading health and wellbeing benefits for partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week.\n•\nExtend parental leave. Starbucks covers up to 18 weeks of fully paid leave for birth parents, and up to 12 weeks of fully paid leave for non-birth parents for partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week.\nOutside of the U.S., we have provided other innovative benefits to help address market-specific needs, such as providing interest-free loans to our U.K. partners to help cover rental deposits, mental health services in Canada, and, in China, an extra 14th Month Pay initiative, giving retail partners an additional month’s salary as a bonus on top of the 13th month pay that is customary in China, as well as a monthly housing subsidy for full-time Starbucks baristas and shift supervisors, and comprehensive health insurance coverage for parents of partners.\n4\nTable of Contents\nRole-based Support\nTo help our partners succeed in their roles, we emphasize ongoing training and development opportunities. These include, but are not limited to, role-based training for our retail hourly partners, safety and security protocols, updates on new products and service offerings, and deployment of technologies. We periodically address a wide variety of topics such as achievable goal setting, giving and receiving constructive feedback, and effective engagement with communities and customers through the rollout of the Green Apron Service Model, a new foundational operating model that establishes repeatable, consistent, and scalable standards, across U.S company-operated coffeehouses. It is designed to create deeper connections between partners and customers by enabling partners to deliver consistent, high-quality experiences with warmth and care. The model includes new routines and tools that give partners more time to focus on craft and connection, supported by technology that improves order flow and speed of service.\nPay Equity\nTo be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our partners.\nStarbucks is committed to fair pay principles to ensure partners are paid appropriately and equitably for their roles and the work they do, regardless of race, gender, or other protected categories. Further, we have formulated pay-equity principles, which provide equal footing, transparency, and accountability as best practices that help address known, systemic barriers to global pay equity.\nAs of September 28, 2025, Starbucks employed approximately 381,000 people worldwide. In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 223,000 people, with approximately 214,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in corporate support, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution operations. Approximately 158,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 153,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. Partners in approximately 6% of Starbucks U.S. company-operated stores are represented by unions. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, evidenced by low turnover, a strong culture, and active employee participation.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nName\nAge\nPosition\nBrian Niccol\n51\nchairman and chief executive officer\nCathy R.

Unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Revenues from our reportable operating segments as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal 2025 were as follows: North America (74%), International (21%), and Channel Development (5%).\nOur North America and International segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our North America segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our International operations are in various stages of development and may require more extensive support, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our North America operations.\nOur Channel Development segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, Starbucks-branded single-serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino\n®\n and Starbucks Doubleshot\n®\n, foodservice products, and other branded products sold worldwide outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. A large portion of our Channel Development business operates under a licensed model of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, while our global ready-to-drink businesses operate under collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Nestlé, and others.\n6\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Components\nWe generate the majority of our revenues through company-operated stores and licensed stores. \nCompany-operated and Licensed Store Summary as of September 28, 2025:\nNorth America\nAs a % of \nTotal\nNorth America Stores\nInternational\nAs a % of \nTotal\nInternational Stores\nTotal\nAs a % of\nTotal \nStores\nCompany-operated stores\n11,018 \n60 \n%\n10,496 \n46 \n%\n21,514 \n52 \n%\nLicensed stores\n7,293 \n40 \n%\n12,183 \n54 \n%\n19,476 \n48 \n%\nTotal\n18,311\n \n100\n \n%\n22,679\n \n100\n \n%\n40,990\n \n100\n \n%\nThe mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market generally varies based on several factors, including our ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity, profitability, and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks, and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region.\nCompany-operated Stores\nRevenue from company-operated stores accounted for 83% of total net revenues during fiscal 2025. Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee, tea, and related products, as well as complementary food offerings, and by providing each customer with a unique \nStarbucks Experience\n. The \nStarbucks Experience\n is built upon superior customer service through the Green Apron Service Model, convenience, and a seamless digital experience as well as warm and welcoming stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty.\nOur strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our category share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including expected financial returns, the maturity of the market, economic conditions, consumer behavior, and the local business environment.\nCompany-operated store data for the fiscal year-ended September 28, 2025:\n \nStores Open \nas of\nStores Open \nas of\n \nSep 29, 2024\nOpened\nClosed \n(1)\nTransfers \n(2)\nNet\nSep 28, 2025\nNorth America:\nU.S.\n10,158 \n509 \n(620)\n— \n(111)\n10,047 \nCanada\n997 \n45 \n(75)\n— \n(30)\n967 \nSiren Retail\n6 \n— \n(2)\n— \n(2)\n4 \nTotal North America\n11,161 \n554 \n(697)\n— \n(143)\n11,018 \nInternational:\nChina\n7,594 \n569 \n(154)\n— \n415 \n8,009 \nJapan\n1,809 \n87 \n(12)\n(1)\n74 \n1,883 \nU.K.\n378 \n44 \n(11)\n113 \n146 \n524 \nAll Other\n71 \n7 \n(3)\n— \n4 \n75 \nSiren Retail\n5 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n5 \nTotal International\n9,857 \n707 \n(180)\n112 \n639 \n10,496 \nTotal company-operated\n21,018\n \n1,261\n \n(877)\n112\n \n496\n \n21,514\n \n(1)\nIncludes 627 stores closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 as part of our “Back to Starbucks” restructuring plan.\n(2)\nIncludes 113 licensed stores converted to company-operated stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 following the acquisition of 23.5 Degrees Topco Limited.\nStarbucks company-operated stores are typically located in high-traffic, high-visibility locations. Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses, and rural and off-highway locations. We will continue to expand our coffeehouse portfolio to meet customers where they are with formats that provide a warm and welcoming environment, enable multiple opportunities to connect and gather, and provide attractive returns on invested capital.\n7\nTable of Contents\nRetail sales mix by product type for company-operated stores:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSep 28,\n2025\nSep 29,\n2024\nOct 1,\n2023\nBeverages\n73 \n%\n74 \n%\n74 \n%\nFood\n23 \n%\n23 \n%\n22 \n%\nOther\n(1)\n4 \n%\n3 \n%\n4 \n%\nTotal\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n(1)\n“Other” primarily consists of serveware, packaged and single-serve coffees and teas, and ready-to-drink beverages, among other items.\nStored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\nOur branded stored value card program (the “Starbucks Card”) is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting, and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks\n®\n Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Starbucks Cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan, and many of our other markets in our International segment. Starbucks Cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks\n®\n Mobile App, and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their Starbucks Card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points (“Stars”) earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to \nNote 1\n, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our Starbucks Cards and loyalty program.\nLicensed Stores\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 12% of total net revenues in fiscal 2025. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food, and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.\n8\nTable of Contents\nLicensed store data for the fiscal year-ended September 28, 2025:\n \nStores Open \nas of\nStores Open \nas of\n \nSep 29, 2024\nOpened\nClosed\nTransfers  \n(1)\nNet\nSep 28, 2025\nNorth America:\nU.S.\n6,777 \n238 \n(202)\n— \n36 \n6,813 \nCanada\n486 \n14 \n(20)\n— \n(6)\n480 \nTotal North America\n7,263 \n252 \n(222)\n— \n30 \n7,293 \nInternational:\nKorea\n1,980 \n134 \n(37)\n— \n97 \n2,077 \nLatin America\n1,705 \n115 \n(7)\n— \n108 \n1,813 \nU.K.\n976 \n56 \n(19)\n(113)\n(76)\n900 \nTurkey\n722 \n45 \n(5)\n— \n40 \n762 \nTaiwan\n571 \n33 \n(12)\n— \n21 \n592 \nIndonesia\n603 \n8 \n(14)\n— \n(6)\n597 \nThailand\n513 \n39 \n(2)\n— \n37 \n550 \nPhilippines\n479 \n43 \n(2)\n— \n41 \n520 \nAll Other\n4,369 \n276 \n(274)\n1 \n3 \n4,372 \nTotal International\n11,918 \n749 \n(372)\n(112)\n265 \n12,183 \nTotal licensed\n19,181\n \n1,001\n \n(594)\n(112)\n295\n \n19,476\n \n(1)\nIncludes 113 licensed stores converted to company-operated stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 following the acquisition of 23.5 Degrees Topco Limited.\nOther Revenues \nOther revenues primarily are recorded in our Channel Development segment and include sales of packaged coffee, tea, and ready-to-drink beverages to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as royalties received from Nestlé under the Global Coffee Alliance and other collaborative partnerships.\nProduct Supply\nStarbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To help ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we generally control substantially all coffee purchasing, roasting, and packaging, and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. Nestlé controls distribution of Starbucks packaged coffee products outside of Starbucks stores through the Global Coffee Alliance, and in some cases, also roasts and packages these products. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single-origin coffees.\nThe price of coffee is subject to volatility and has steadily increased over the past five years with significant increases over the last two years. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude \narabica\n coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather and extreme weather events, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increases in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, and political and economic conditions. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Price is also impacted by geopolitical conditions, including new and existing tariffs on coffee imports and other trade controls, and by trading activities in the \narabica\n coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies.\nWe buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. We also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts, and collars to hedge “C” price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our long-term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2026.\n9\nTable of Contents\nWe depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies, and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote.\nTo help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of this high-growth market. Farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields as well as agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts.\nIn addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our dairy and plant-based dairy-free suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant-based dairy-free alternatives to support our stores generally is remote.\nProducts other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional, and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We believe, based on the established relationship and historical performance of our suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote.\nCompetition\nOur primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality, brand reputation, service, and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.\nOur coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores, and foodservice accounts and also compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market. \nTrademarks, Copyrights, Patents, and Domain Names\nStarbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, and Frappuccino, are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\nWe own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics, and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems, and designs, which have an average remaining duration of approximately fifteen years. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com,” “Starbucks.net,” and “Starbucksreserve.com.”\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to, and loaded by, customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Starbucks Cards, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nGovernment Regulation \nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules, reporting obligations, and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations, and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\n10\nTable of Contents\nAvailable Information\nStarbucks Annual Report on Form 10-K reports, along with all other reports and amendments filed with or furnished to the SEC, are publicly available free of charge on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.starbucks.com as soon as reasonably practicable after these materials are filed with or furnished to the SEC.

  "item7": "Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified above, under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this 10-K, and elsewhere herein. Therefore, our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.\nGeneral\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 included 52 weeks.\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023, included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024.\nOverview\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\nWe believe our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales, and operating margin management, underpinned by disciplined capital allocation. Comparable store sales \nincludes company-operated stores open 13 months or longer, and exclude the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. Stores that are temporarily closed remain in comparable store sales while permanent store closures are removed in the month following closure. \nWe believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:\n•\nNew store openings and store count\n•\nComparable store sales\n•\nOperating margin\nStarbucks results for fiscal 2025 showed continued progress on key “Back to Starbucks” initiatives, specifically investments in coffeehouse partners, as we work to rebuild a stronger Starbucks. These investments include the Green Apron Service model, additional investments in staffing and hours at the right times to deliver enhanced customer service, and the Leadership Experience 2025, a conference designed to empower and motivate our retail leaders to accelerate our “Back to Starbucks” strategy. Consolidated net revenues increased 3% to $37.2 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $36.2 billion in fiscal 2024, primarily driven by incremental revenues from net new company-operated stores over the past 12 months, an increase in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance, and incremental revenue from the acquisition of 23.5 Degrees Topco Limited, a U.K. licensed business partner, partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales and a decline in our licensed store business.\nFor both the North America segment and U.S. market, revenue increased 1% in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, primarily driven by net new company-operated store growth of 4%\n,\n or 441 stores, over the past 12 months, prior to the 584 North America restructuring closures late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. This growth was partially offset by a 2% decline in comparable store sales. \nComparable transactions declined\n 4%\n, partially offset by average ticket growth of \n2%\n, primarily driven by annualization of pricing\n in the current year. Also contributing were lower product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees.\nFor the International segment, revenue increased 7% in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, primarily driven by net new company-operated and licensed store openings over the past 12 months, incremental net revenue from the conversion of 113 licensed stores to company-operated stores following the acquisition of 23.5 Degrees Topco Limited during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, and higher product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees.\nRevenue for our Channel Development segment increased 6% in fiscal 2025 compared with fiscal 2024, primarily driven by an increase in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance.\nIn support of our “Back to Starbucks” strategy, we completed our assessment of our coffeehouse portfolio late in the fourth quarter and made decisions to close stores that did not demonstrate a viable path to profitability, or meet our standards of delivering a warm, welcoming space for our customers and partners. Our store closures in North America were substantially \n27\nTable of Contents\ncompleted in fiscal 2025 and the International store closures are expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2026. As a result of these closures, we expect a fiscal 2026 reduction in our baseline North America company-operated revenues, partially offset by sales transfer to nearby coffeehouses that remain open. We also expect the future impact to operating margins to be slightly accretive. With a healthier base of coffeehouses, we see meaningful opportunity for disciplined growth. We anticipate that these actions, along with simplifying our broader support organization, will allow us to restructure, redeploy, and refocus our resources on priorities that we believe will deliver long-term sustainable business growth.\nWe expect that the macroeconomic challenges we have been experiencing, including impacts from new tariffs and dynamic coffee prices, will continue; however, we are encouraged by the results we have seen from our “Back to Starbucks” initiatives. Following our Green Apron Service model going live across our full U.S company-operated store portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we are focused on empowering coffeehouse leaders to take ownership of sustaining the model as our permanent way of working, which we expect to enhance the customer experience and drive future transaction growth. Further, as announced in early November 2025, we look forward to working with our new strategic joint venture partner, Boyu Capital, to accelerate long-term growth in China. We believe, through strategic prioritization, that we are taking the right actions now and in the future, specifically through our investments in store partners, uplifting the coffeehouse experience through disciplined capital deployment, introducing new food and beverage platforms, reimagining the Starbucks rewards program, and enhancing support for our licensee partners. These actions, while driving more efficiency, accountability, and agility as a company, will lay the foundation for the future of Starbucks. \n28\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Highlights\n•\nTotal net revenues increased 3% to\n $37.2 billion\n in fiscal 2025 compared to $36.2 billion in fiscal 2024.\n•\nConsolidated operating inco\nme decreased to $2.9 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $5.4 billion in fiscal 2024. Fiscal 2025 operating margin was 7.9% compared to 15.0% in fiscal 2024. Operating margin contraction of 710 basis points was primarily due to restructuring costs ass\nociated with the closure of coffeehouses and simplification of our support organization (approximately 240 basis points)\n, deleverage (approximately 210 basis points), investments in support of “Back to Starbucks,” which were largely in labor hours (approximately 130 basis points), and inflation (approximately 80 basis points).\n•\nDiluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2025 declined to $1.63, compared to EPS of $3.31 in fiscal 2024. \nThe decrease was primarily driven by contraction in operating margin, including restructuring and impairment costs in support of our “Back to Starbucks” strategy, as compared to the prior year.\n•\nCapital expenditures were $2.3 billion in fiscal 2025 and $2.8 billion in fiscal 2024.\n•\nWe returned \n$2.8 billion\n and $3.8 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively, through dividends and share repurchases.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nSee \nNote 2\n, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2025 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2024 \nConsolidated results of operations \n(in millions)\n:\nRevenues\nFiscal Year Ended\nSep 28,\n2025\nSep 29,\n2024\n%\nChange\nNet revenues:\nCompany-operated stores\n$\n30,744.8 \n$\n29,765.9 \n3.3 \n%\nLicensed stores\n4,350.4 \n4,505.1 \n(3.4)\nOther \n2,089.2 \n1,905.2 \n9.7 \nTotal net revenues\n$\n37,184.4\n \n$\n36,176.2\n \n2.8\n \n%\nTotal net revenues \nincreased $1 billion, or 3%, over fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher revenues from company-operated stores ($979 million) and other revenues ($184 million), partially offset by a decline in revenues from licensed stores ($155 million).\nCompany-operated store revenue increased $979 million, primarily driven by net new company-operated store growth of 5%, or 1,010 stores, over the past 12 months ($1.2 billion), prior to the 627 restructuring closures late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, and incremental revenue from the conversion of 113 licensed stores to company-operated stores ($131 million) following the acquisition of 23.5 Degrees Topco Limited. Partially offsetting this increase was a 1% decline in comparable store sales ($408 million), attributable to a 2% decline in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 1% increase in average ticket, primarily due to annualization of prior year pricing.\nLicensed stores revenue \ndecreased $155 million, primarily driven by lower product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees in our North America segment ($143 million), the impact of the acquisition of 23.5 Degrees Topco Limited ($36 million), and by unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts ($22 million). These decreases were partially offset by higher product sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees in our International segment ($79 million).\nOther reven\nues increased $184 million, primarily due to an increase in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance ($99 million) and increased sales of cocoa butter to third parties ($66 million).\n29\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nFiscal Year Ended\nSep 28,\n2025\nSep 29,\n2024\nSep 28,\n2025\nSep 29,\n2024\nAs a % of Total\nNet Revenues\nProduct and distribution costs\n$\n11,658.2 \n$\n11,180.6 \n31.4 \n%\n30.9 \n%\nStore operating expenses\n17,058.9 \n15,286.5 \n45.9 \n42.3 \nOther operating expenses\n584.6 \n565.6 \n1.6 \n1.6 \nDepreciation and amortization expenses\n1,684.7 \n1,512.6 \n4.5 \n4.2 \nGeneral and administrative expenses\n2,617.2 \n2,523.3 \n7.0 \n7.0 \nRestructuring and impairments\n892.0 \n— \n2.4 \n— \nTotal operating expenses\n34,495.6 \n31,068.6 \n92.8 \n85.9 \nIncome from equity investees\n247.8 \n301.2 \n0.7 \n0.8 \nOperating income\n$\n2,936.6\n \n$\n5,408.8\n \n7.9\n \n%\n15.0\n \n%\nStore operating expenses as a % of related revenues\n55.5 \n%\n51.4 \n%\nProduct and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points\n, primarily due to inflation (approximately 80 basis points).\nStore operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenu\nes increased \n360 basis points\n. \nStore operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 410 basis points\n, primarily due to deleverage (approximately 200 basis points), additional labor (approximately 160 basis points), and increased marketing (approximately 90 basis points).\nOther operating expenses increased $19 million, \nprimarily due to support costs for our licensed markets.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 30 basis points,\n primarily due to deleverage.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $94 million\n, primarily due to the Leadership Experience 2025 ($81 million).\nRestructuring and impairments were $892 million, largely due to costs associated with the closure of coffeehouses and simplification of our support organization. \nSee \nNote 1\n8\n, Restructuring, to the consolidated financial statements included i\nn Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion.\nIncome from equity investees decreased $53.4 million, primarily due to lower income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture.\nThe combination of these changes resulted \nin an overall decrease in operating margin of 710 basis points i\nn fiscal 2025 when compared to fiscal 2024.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOther Income and Expenses\nFiscal Year Ended\nSep 28,\n2025\nSep 29,\n2024\nSep 28,\n2025\nSep 29,\n2024\n \n \nAs a % of Total\nNet Revenues\nOperating income\n$\n2,936.6 \n$\n5,408.8 \n7.9 \n%\n15.0 \n%\nInterest income and other, net\n113.3 \n122.8 \n0.3 \n0.3 \nInterest expense\n(542.6)\n(562.0)\n(1.5)\n(1.6)\nEarnings before income taxes\n2,507.3 \n4,969.6 \n6.7 \n13.7 \nIncome tax expense\n650.6 \n1,207.3 \n1.7 \n3.3 \nNet earnings including noncontrolling interests\n1,856.7 \n3,762.3 \n5.0 \n10.4 \nNet earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n0.3 \n1.4 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nNet earnings attributable to Starbucks\n$\n1,856.4\n \n$\n3,760.9\n \n5.0\n \n%\n10.4\n \n%\nEffective tax rate including noncontrolling interests\n25.9 \n%\n24.3 \n%\nInterest income and other, net\n decreased $10 million, \nprimarily due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in the current year. \nInterest expens\ne decreased $19 million,\n primarily due to savings from cross-currency interest rate hedging, partially offset by higher interest rates on refinanced long-term debt.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 was 25.9% compared to 24.3% for fiscal 2024.The increase was \nprimarily due to the discrete impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign entities in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (approximately 290 basis points), partially offset by the discrete impact of a tax status change for a certain foreign entity in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (approximately 120 basis points).

The 2025 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion. \nBorrowings under the 2025 credit facility will bear interest at a fluctuating rate based on the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”), and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2025 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable rate. The applicable rate is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The 2025 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time Term SOFR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The “Base Rate” of interest is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.00% and (iv) 1.00%. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the\n2025 credit facility, interest on the outstanding amount of the indebtedness under the 2025 credit facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2% in excess of the interest then borne by such borrowings.\nThe 2025 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 28, 2025, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2025 credit facility as of September 28, 2025, or our 2021 credit facility as of September 29, 2024.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOur total available contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $3.0 billion as of the end of fiscal 2025.\nCommercial Paper\nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our 2025 credit facility. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of September 28, 2025, and September 29, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program.\nCredit Facilities in Japan\nAdditionally, we hold the following Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities that are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market:\n•\nA ¥5.0 billion, or $33.4 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on December 30, 2025. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (“TIBOR”) plus an applicable margin of 0.400%.\n•\nA ¥10.0 billion, or $66.8 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on March 27, 2026. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.300%.\nAs of September 28, 2025 and September 29, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.\nSee \nNote 9\n, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.\nOur ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the long-term notes were issued. As of September 28, 2025, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. \nUse of Cash\nWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program, and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases, and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Furthermore, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.\nWe believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally, combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt, will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for at least the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases, refinancing debt maturities, as well as investing in new business opportunities. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances.\nWe regularly review our cash positions and our determination of partial indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or another portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes, which could be material. Any foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated at management’s discretion.\n During fiscal 2025, \nwe revised our indefinite reinvestment assertions from prior years' cumulative earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, and\n in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we repatriated approximately \n$900 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries, upon which approximately $90 million\n in related withholding taxes were recorded and paid. \nWe continue to be indefinitely reinvested in the remainder of our foreign earnings, for which no tax accrual has been recorded.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOn July 4, 2025, the President of the United States signed and enacted tax legislation into law through a reconciliation bill titled “An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14,” commonly referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” This legislation was enacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025; therefore, the fiscal 2025 accounting impacts from this tax law change are\n included\n in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 results. This tax law change did not result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. See \nNote 14\n, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion.\nDuring each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of \n$0.57\n per share. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, and for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, we declared a cash dividend of \n$0.61 \nper share. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we declared a cash dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid on \nNovember 28, 2025\n, with an expected payout of approximately \n$704.8 million\n. Dividends are generally paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2025 and 2024 totaled \n$2.8 billion \nand \n$2.6 billion\n, respectively. \nDuring the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024, we repurchased 12.8 million shares of common stock for \n$1.3 billion\n on the open market. During the fiscal year ended September 28, 2025, we made no common stock share repurchases. As of September 28, 2025, 29.8 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations.\nOther than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2026 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures in our new and existing stores, our supply chain, and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2026 ar\ne expected to\n be moderately \nlower than fiscal 2025.\nThe following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of September 28, 2025, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows (\nin millions\n):\n \nMaterial Cash Requirements\nTotal\nLess than 1\nYear\n1 - 3\nYears\n3 - 5\nYears\nMore than\n5 Years\nOperating lease obligations\n(1)\n$\n12,389.2 \n$\n1,940.6 \n$\n3,305.7 \n$\n2,550.7 \n$\n4,592.2 \nDebt obligations\nPrincipal payments\n16,200.0 \n1,500.0 \n2,850.0 \n3,000.0 \n8,850.0 \nInterest payments\n6,264.1 \n603.4 \n1,033.4 \n816.2 \n3,811.1 \nPurchase obligations\n(2)\n1,350.8 \n1,185.4 \n165.4 \n— \n— \nOther obligations\n(3)\n308.3 \n117.0 \n49.0 \n40.1 \n102.2 \nTotal\n$\n36,512.4 \n$\n5,346.4 \n$\n7,403.5 \n$\n6,407.0 \n$\n17,355.5 \n(1)\nAmounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance, and other related expenses.\n(2)\nPurchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 88% of total purchase obligations.\n(3)\nOther obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of long-term asset retirement obligations, income taxes payable, equity investment capital commitments, and finance lease obligations.\nCash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.7 billion for fiscal 2025, compared to $6.1 billion for fiscal 2024. The change was primarily due to the decrease in net earnings of $1.9 billion and a net increase of $451.2 million in inventories, which was primarily driven by green and roasted coffee, largely due to elevated coffee prices. These impacts were partially offset by a net increase of $713.2 million in loss on disposal, impairment, and accelerated amortization of assets primarily driven by restructuring costs as part of the “Back to Starbucks” strategy and a net increase in accounts payable, primarily due to payment timing. \nCash used in investing activities was $2.5 billion for fiscal 2025, compared to $2.7 billion for fiscal 2024. The change was primarily due to a net decrease in capital expenditures of $472.0 million driven by a reduction in retail store investments and renovations in North America. These increases were partially offset by the acquisition of 23.5 Degrees Topco Limited.\nCash used in financing activities was $2.3 billion for fiscal 2025, compared to $3.7 billion for fiscal 2024. The change was primarily due to no current year share repurchases of our common stock compared to the prior year.\n37\nTable of Contents\nCOMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY, AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS\nCommodity price risk represents our primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast, and sell high-quality \narabica\n coffee and related products, and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities, including impacts from volatility in green coffee prices and new tariffs, directly impact our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to continue to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-K, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I of this 10-K.\nFINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually, and speculative trading activities are prohibited. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge against changes in the fair value of our net investments in foreign operations. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments and cross currency swaps, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to \nNote 1\n, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, and \nNote 3\n, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.\nThe sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar, and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts and financial derivatives, to manage our commodity price risk exposure.\nThe following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 28, 2025, to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the derivative hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items \n(in millions)\n: \n \nIncrease/(Decrease) to Net Earnings\nIncrease/(Decrease) to OCI\n \n10% Increase in\nUnderlying Rate\n10% Decrease in\nUnderlying Rate\n10% Increase in\nUnderlying Rate\n10% Decrease in\nUnderlying Rate\nCommodity hedges\n— \n— \n39 \n(39)\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nThe majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won, and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing, and lending activities, and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that is party to the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items and net investments in foreign operations. The volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. \n38\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 28, 2025, to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the derivative hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (\nin millions\n): \n \nIncrease/(Decrease) to Net Earnings\nIncrease/(Decrease) to OCI\n \n10% Increase in\nUnderlying Rate\n10% Decrease in\nUnderlying Rate\n10% Increase in\nUnderlying Rate\n10% Decrease in\nUnderlying Rate\nForeign currency hedges\n$\n22 \n$\n(22)\n$\n490 \n$\n(490)\nEquity Security Price Risk\nWe have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis based on \na 10% change\n in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 28, 2025, and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nLong-term Debt\nWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See \nNote 3\n, Derivative Financial Instruments, and \nNote 9\n, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of September 28, 2025.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of September 28, 2025, on the fair value of Starbucks debt \n(in millions)\n:\n \nFair Value\nDecrease in Fair Value for a 100 Basis Point Increase in Underlying Rate\nLong-term debt\n(1)\n$\n14,968 \n$\n(873)\n(1)\nAmount disclosed is net of \n$12 million change\n in the fair value of our designated interest rate swaps. Refer to \nNote 3\n, Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 28, 2025, and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nOur significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in \nNote 1\n, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. We believe that our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity for the reasons discussed below.\n39\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). \nIn addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, such as the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when new information becomes available. As discussed in \nNote 14\n, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.\nWe have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. Foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated. If these amounts are distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. \nOur income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted business performance, could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.\n40\nTable of Contents\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life. \nLong-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.\nOur impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics, and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. The fair value of a store’s ROU asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. \nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal \n2025\n, as part of the “Back to Starbucks” strategy, the Company assessed its existing store portfolio with respect to both whether coffeehouses had a viable path to offering the physical environment consistent with the brand and a clear path to financial performance, and we closed, or plan to close, coffeehouses that did not meet these criteria.\nAs a result, we recorded $892 million in restructuring and impairments in our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal year ended September 28, 2025. This total included $352.8 million related to impairment and disposition of company-operated store assets and $239.3 million primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease exit costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. Refer to \nNote 18\n, Restructuring, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion.\nAsset impairment charges are discussed in \nNote 1\n, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. \nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.\nWhen assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation, and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics, and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches, are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations \n41\nTable of Contents\nis affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance, and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S. and China, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months. We note that the goodwill impairment assessment of the China reporting unit was deemed a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions made to determine the fair value. Considerations and procedures performed to address the critical audit matter are discussed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures.\nOur fiscal 2025 annual goodwill impairment testing was completed in the third fiscal quarter. Using the most recent quantitative assessment performed, the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded carrying value by approximately\n $\n120\n billion.\nWhen assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group’s forecasted growth and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance, and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months.\nDefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in \nNote 8\n, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. \nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee \nNote 1\n, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.",
