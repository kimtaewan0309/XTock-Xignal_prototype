The MD&A in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) for CBRE Group, Inc. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our \n2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K (2024 Annual Report)\n as well as the unaudited financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.\nIn addition, the statements and assumptions in this Quarterly Report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 or Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, including, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies and prospects as well as estimates of industry growth for the next quarter and beyond. For important information regarding these forward-looking statements, please see the discussion below under the caption “Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements.”\nBusiness Environment\nThe operating environment for commercial real estate has improved considerably in 2025. This is evident in notably strong occupier demand for office, data center and industrial leases, particularly in the U.S., as well as increased real estate sales activity. Large occupiers’ growing appetite for outsourcing services underpins demand for facilities management and project management work. We continue to monitor the potential impact of U.S. trade policy, including higher tariffs, but to date, have not seen a material effect on capital deployment or real estate occupancy decisions.\nCapital Allocation\nWe did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter of 2025. We repurchased approximately $663 million worth of shares through the nine months ended September 30, 2025, while maintaining substantial liquidity to finance future growth.\n35\nTable of contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, \n(1)\nNine Months Ended September 30, \n(1)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRevenue:\nFacilities management\n$\n5,137 \n50.1 \n%\n$\n4,638 \n51.3 \n%\n$\n15,024 \n51.9 \n%\n$\n13,263 \n52.3 \n%\nProperty management\n657 \n6.4 \n%\n507 \n5.6 \n%\n1,889 \n6.5 \n%\n1,437 \n5.7 \n%\nProject management\n2,027 \n19.8 \n%\n1,683 \n18.6 \n%\n5,444 \n18.8 \n%\n4,766 \n18.8 \n%\nAdvisory leasing\n1,145 \n11.2 \n%\n974 \n10.8 \n%\n3,001 \n10.4 \n%\n2,582 \n10.2 \n%\nValuation\n194 \n1.9 \n%\n178 \n2.0 \n%\n573 \n2.0 \n%\n528 \n2.1 \n%\nLoan servicing\n127 \n1.2 \n%\n130 \n1.4 \n%\n369 \n1.3 \n%\n369 \n1.5 \n%\nOther portfolio services\n90\n0.9 \n%\n96\n1.1 \n%\n267\n0.9 \n%\n282\n1.1 \n%\nCapital markets:\nAdvisory sales\n544 \n5.3 \n%\n420 \n4.6 \n%\n1,364 \n4.7 \n%\n1,129 \n4.5 \n%\nCommercial mortgage origination\n135 \n1.3 \n%\n115 \n1.3 \n%\n351 \n1.2 \n%\n261 \n1.0 \n%\nInvestment management\n148 \n1.4 \n%\n196 \n2.2 \n%\n447 \n1.5 \n%\n494 \n1.9 \n%\nDevelopment services\n63 \n0.6 \n%\n106 \n1.2 \n%\n212 \n0.7 \n%\n268 \n1.1 \n%\nCorporate, other and eliminations\n(9)\n(0.1)\n%\n(7)\n(0.1)\n%\n(20)\n(0.1)\n%\n(16)\n(0.1)\n%\nTotal revenue\n10,258 \n100.0 \n%\n9,036 \n100.0 \n%\n28,921 \n100.0 \n%\n25,363 \n100.0 \n%\nCosts and expenses:\nPass-through costs \n(2)\n4,211 \n41.1 \n%\n3,718 \n41.1 \n%\n12,095 \n41.8 \n%\n10,629 \n41.9 \n%\nCost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs\n4,093 \n39.9 \n%\n3,534 \n39.1 \n%\n11,416 \n39.5 \n%\n9,892 \n39.0 \n%\nOperating, administrative and other\n1,328 \n12.9 \n%\n1,237 \n13.7 \n%\n3,794 \n13.1 \n%\n3,538 \n13.9 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n181 \n1.8 \n%\n178 \n2.0 \n%\n540 \n1.9 \n%\n497 \n2.0 \n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n9,813 \n95.7 \n%\n8,667 \n95.9 \n%\n27,845 \n96.3 \n%\n24,556 \n96.8 \n%\nGain (loss) on disposition of real estate\n36 \n0.4 \n%\n(1)\n0.0 \n%\n55 \n0.2 \n%\n12 \n0.0 \n%\nOperating income\n481 \n4.7 \n%\n368 \n4.1 \n%\n1,131 \n3.9 \n%\n819 \n3.2 \n%\nEquity income (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries\n53 \n0.5 \n%\n(4)\n0.0 \n%\n50 \n0.2 \n%\n(77)\n(0.3)\n%\nOther income\n3 \n0.0 \n%\n12 \n0.1 \n%\n10 \n0.0 \n%\n26 \n0.1 \n%\nInterest expense, net of interest income\n50 \n0.5 \n%\n64 \n0.7 \n%\n159 \n0.5 \n%\n163 \n0.6 \n%\nWrite-off of financing costs on extinguished debt\n— \n0.0 \n%\n— \n0.0 \n%\n2 \n0.0 \n%\n— \n0.0 \n%\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n487 \n4.7 \n%\n312 \n3.5 \n%\n1,030 \n3.6 \n%\n605 \n2.4 \n%\nProvision for income taxes\n91 \n0.9 \n%\n67 \n0.7 \n%\n203 \n0.7 \n%\n70 \n0.3 \n%\nNet income\n396 \n3.9 \n%\n245 \n2.7 \n%\n827 \n2.9 \n%\n535 \n2.1 \n%\nLess: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n33 \n0.3 \n%\n20 \n0.2 \n%\n86 \n0.3 \n%\n54 \n0.2 \n%\nNet income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc.\n$\n363 \n3.5 \n%\n$\n225 \n2.5 \n%\n$\n741 \n2.6 \n%\n$\n481 \n1.9 \n%\nCore EBITDA\n$\n821 \n8.0 \n%\n$\n688 \n7.6 \n%\n$\n2,019 \n7.0 \n%\n$\n1,618 \n6.4 \n%\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nCalculated as a percentage of Total Revenue.\n(2)\nPass-through costs represent certain costs incurred associated with subcontracted third-party vendor work performed for clients.

Revenue from our Project Management segment increas\ned, driven by strength in the United Kingdom, the Middle East and North America. Revenue decreased in the Real Estate Investments (REI) segment, \ndriven by incentive fees recognized in the prior year quarter.\nForeign currency translation had a 1.7% positive impact on revenue, reflecting strength in the euro and British pound sterling partially offset by weakness in the Indian rupee.\nPass-through costs increased 13.3% during the quarter as compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to revenue growth in the BOE and Project Management segments. \nF\noreign currency translation had a 1.8% negative impact on pass-through costs.\nCost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs increased 15.8% during the quarter as compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to revenue growth consisting\n of higher commission expense and employee compensation, as well as higher indirect reimbursed costs. F\noreign currency translation had a 1.6% negative impact on total cost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs. Cost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs increased slightly to 39.9% of total revenue from 39.1% driven by higher costs to support growth in revenues.\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased 7.4% during the quarter as compared to the same period in 2024. The increase was driven by\n an increase in third-party fees related to acquisitions and integration activities, along with an increase in employee compensation, driven by revenue growth. F\noreign currency translation had a 1.7% negative impact on total operating expenses during the quarter. Operating, administrative and other expenses as a percentage of reven\nue decreased to 12.9% in t\nhe third quarter 2025 from 13.7% in the third quarter 2024, as operating expenses grew slower than revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by 1.7% during the quarter, as compared to the same period in 2024, reflecting higher depreciation and amortization expense related to ass\nets acquired from recent acquisitions, such as Industrious.\nGain on disposition of real estate increased by $36 million during the quarter, dr\niven by monetization of real estate development assets in the REI segment. \nWe recorded equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of approximately $53 million, compared to equity loss of $4 million in the third quarter 2024, primarily due to positive co-investment returns and sales in the current quarter.\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased by 21.9%, compared with the third quarter 2024. This decrease was primarily attributable\n to increased net investment hedging activity, offset by the impact of increased commercial paper borrowings and the issuance of senior term loans and new senior unsecured notes.\nOur provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $91 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to a provision for income taxes of $67 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase of $24 million is primarily related to an increase in current year earnings and favorable permanent book tax differences. Our effective tax rate decreased to 18.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from 21.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 is different than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21.0%, primarily due to U.S. state taxes and favorable permanent book tax differences.\nLegislative Developments\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD) Pillar Two Model Rules established a minimum global effective tax rate of 15% on country-by-country profits for large multinational companies. European Union member states along with many other countries adopted or expect to adopt the OECD Pillar Two Model effective January 1, 2024 or thereafter. The OECD and other countries continue to publish guidelines and legislation which include transition and safe harbor rules. We continue to monitor new legislative changes and assess the global impact of the Pillar Two Model Rules.\n37\nTable of contents\nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. Government enacted, H.R.1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBBA\"), a budget reconciliation package that changes the U.S. federal income tax laws, including extensions of various expiring provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  The 2025 impacts of the OBBBA are insignificant based on our current operations.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nWe reported consolidated net income of $741 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 on revenue of $28.9 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $481 million on revenue of $25.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe revenue increase of 14.0% reflected growth in leasing activity, particularly for office space, industrial and data centers, along with increased revenue from \ncommercial mortgage origination and property sales in the \nAdvisory segment and continued growth in the BOE segment, which benefited from strong new business activity, contract expansions and acquisitions. Revenue from our Project Management segment increased, driven by continued strong performance from the United Kingdom, North America and the Middle East. Revenue decreased in the REI segment, driven by lower carried interest and \nincentive fees recognized in the prior year.\n \nForeign currency translation had a 0.4% positive impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily driven by strength in the British pound sterling and euro, partially offset by weakness in the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Indian rupee and Mexican peso.\nPass-through costs increased 13.8% during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to revenue growth in the BOE and Project Management segments. \nF\noreign currency translation had a 0.4% negative impact on pass-through costs.\nCost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs increased 15.4% during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to revenue growth consistin\ng of higher commission expense and employee compensation, as well as higher indirect reimbursed costs. F\noreign currency translation had a 0.3% negative impact on total cost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs. Cost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs increased slightly to 39.5% of total revenue from 39.0%.\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased 7.2% as compared to the same period last year. The increase was driven by an increase in third-party fees related to acquisitions and integration activities, along with an increase in bad debt expenses and \nemployee compensation, driven by revenue growth\n. Foreign currency translation had a 0.3% negative impact on total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Operating, administrative and other expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 13.1% from 13.9%, as operating expenses grew slower than revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by 8.7% during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, reflecting higher depreciation and amortization expense related to assets acquired from recent acquisitions, such as Industrious.\nGain on disposition of real estate increased by $43 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, driven by monetization of real estate development assets in the REI segment. \nWe reported equity income of $50 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to equity loss of $77 million in the same period in 2024. This was primarily driven by positive co-investment returns and sales in the current period, compared to higher unrealized equity losses in the prior period, driven by a fair value adjustment related to our non-core strategic equity investment in Altus.\nInterest expense, net of interest income, decreased by 2.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period\n in 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of net investment hedging activity, partially offset by the impact of increased comm\nercial paper borrowings and the issuance of senior term loans and new senior unsecured notes.\nOur provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $203 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to a provision for income taxes of $70 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase of $133 million is primarily related to an increase in earnings, favorable permanent book tax differences, and a prior year benefit for the reversal of unrecognized tax positions. Our effective tax rate increased to 19.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 from 11.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our effective tax rate for the nine months \n38\nTable of contents\nended September 30, 2025 is different than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to the U.S. state taxes and favorable permanent book tax differences.\n39\nTable of contents\nSegment Operations\nIn January 2025, we combined our project management business with our Turner & Townsend majority-owned subsidiary and created a fourth reportable segment, Project Management. In addition, on January 16, 2025, we acquired full ownership of Industrious, a provider of premium flexible workplace solutions, and established a new business segment, Building Operations & Experience (BOE), comprised of enterprise and local facilities management, property management and flexible workplace solutions.\nIn connection with the transactions described above, we organized our operations around, and publicly report our financial results on, four reportable business segments: (1) Advisory Services; (2) BOE; (3) Project Management; and (4) Real Estate Investments (REI). \nAdvisory Services provides a comprehensive range of services globally, including property leasing, capital markets (property sales and loan origination), loan servicing, and valuation. BOE provides a broad suite of integrated, contractually based outsourcing services to occupiers and owners of real estate, including facilities management and property management. Our Project Management business delivers program management, project management and cost consultancy services across commercial real estate, infrastructure and natural resources sectors. REI is a major real assets developer, investor and operator and is comprised of two businesses: investment management and development services. \nWe also have a Corporate and Other segment. Corporate primarily consists of corporate overhead costs. Other consists of activities from strategic non-core non-controlling equity investments and is considered an operating segment but does not meet the aggregation criteria for presentation as a separate reportable segment and is, therefore, combined with Corporate and reported as Corporate and other. It also includes eliminations related to inter-segment revenue. For additional information on our segments, see Note 16 – Segments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\n40\nTable of contents\nAdvisory Services\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for our Advisory Services operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, \n(1)\nNine Months Ended September 30, \n(1)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRevenue:\nAdvisory leasing\n$\n1,145 \n51.2 \n%\n$\n974 \n50.9 \n%\n$\n3,001 \n50.6 \n%\n$\n2,582 \n50.1 \n%\nValuation\n194 \n8.7 \n%\n178 \n9.3 \n%\n573 \n9.7 \n%\n528 \n10.3 \n%\nLoan servicing\n127 \n5.7 \n%\n130 \n6.8 \n%\n369 \n6.2 \n%\n369 \n7.2 \n%\nOther portfolio services\n90 \n4.0 \n%\n96 \n5.0 \n%\n267 \n4.5 \n%\n282 \n5.5 \n%\nCapital markets:\nAdvisory sales\n544 \n24.3 \n%\n420 \n22.0 \n%\n1,364 \n23.0 \n%\n1,129 \n21.9 \n%\nCommercial mortgage origination\n135 \n6.0 \n%\n115 \n6.0 \n%\n351 \n5.9 \n%\n261 \n5.1 \n%\nTotal segment revenue\n2,235 \n100.0 \n%\n1,913 \n100.0 \n%\n5,925 \n100.0 \n%\n5,151 \n100.0 \n%\nCosts and expenses:\nPass-through costs \n(2)\n13 \n0.6 \n%\n17 \n0.9 \n%\n39 \n0.7 \n%\n43 \n0.8 \n%\nCost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs\n1,298 \n58.1 \n%\n1,105 \n57.8 \n%\n3,403 \n57.4 \n%\n2,941 \n57.1 \n%\nOperating, administrative and other\n481 \n21.5 \n%\n447 \n23.4 \n%\n1,364 \n23.0 \n%\n1,304 \n25.3 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n69 \n3.1 \n%\n67 \n3.5 \n%\n203 \n3.4 \n%\n192 \n3.7 \n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n1,861 \n83.3 \n%\n1,636 \n85.5 \n%\n5,009 \n84.5 \n%\n4,480 \n87.0 \n%\nOperating income\n374 \n16.7 \n%\n277 \n14.5 \n%\n916 \n15.5 \n%\n671 \n13.0 \n%\nEquity loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries\n— \n0.0 \n%\n(9)\n(0.5)\n%\n— \n0.0 \n%\n(8)\n(0.2)\n%\nOther income\n1 \n0.0 \n%\n2 \n0.1 \n%\n4 \n0.1 \n%\n2 \n0.0 \n%\nAdd-back: Depreciation and amortization\n69 \n3.1 \n%\n67 \n3.5 \n%\n203 \n3.4 \n%\n192 \n3.7 \n%\nAdjustments:\nImpact of fair value non-cash adjustments related to unconsolidated equity investments\n— \n0.0 \n%\n9 \n0.5 \n%\n2 \n0.0 \n%\n9 \n0.2 \n%\nCosts associated with efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives\n— \n0.0 \n%\n13 \n0.7 \n%\n— \n0.0 \n%\n13 \n0.3 \n%\nSegment operating profit\n$\n444 \n$\n359 \n$\n1,125 \n$\n879 \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nCalculated as a percentage of Total Revenue.\n(2)\nPass-through costs represent certain costs incurred associated with subcontracted third-party vendor work performed for clients. These costs are reimbursable by clients and the corresponding amounts owed are reflected within Revenue.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenue increased 16.8% during the quarter compared to the same period in 2024. Property sales revenue grew 29.5%, led by office, industrial, land and data centers in the U.S., APAC and Europe. Globally, sales grew double-digits across office, industrial and multifamily. Global leasing revenue rose 17.6%, led by data centers, office and industrial leasing driven by Americas which grew 19.1%, including 17.9% in the United States and APAC which grew 21.6%. \nForeign currency translation had a 1.0% positive impact on total revenue during the quarter, primarily driven by strength in the euro and British pound sterling partially offset by weakness in the Australian dollar and Indian rupee.\nCost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs increased 17.5%, primarily reflecting business growth and higher commission expense. Foreign currency translation had a 0.9% negative impact on total cost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs. Cost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs as a percentage of total revenue increased slightly to 58.1% compared to the same period in 2024, as costs of revenue increased proportionately with the increase in revenue.\n41\nTable of contents\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased by 7.6%, as compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher employee compensation and business promotion, advertising and travel expenses driven by the growth in the business. Foreign currency translation had a 1.3% negative impact on total operating expenses.\nIn connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans with servicing rights retained, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) on the date the loans are sold. Upon origination of a mortgage loan held for sale, the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights to be retained is included in the forecasted proceeds from the anticipated loan sale and results in a net gain (which is reflected in revenue). Our MSRs are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized in proportion to and over the period that the servicing income is expected to be received based on projections and timing of estimated future net cash flows and assessed for impairment based on the fair value each reporting period. \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, MSRs contributed $41 million to operating income, offset by $36 million of amortization of related intangible assets. The MSR contribution to third quarter 2024 operating income was $38 million and amortization totaled $36 million. The increase was associated with higher origination activity given an increase in financing activities and strong performance in both agency and non-agency lending.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased 3.0% primarily due to higher amortization of mortgage servicing rights as described above.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenue increased 15.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Property sales revenue increased 20.8%, led by office, industrial, land and data centers in the U.S., APAC and Europe. Global leasing revenue rose 16.2%, led by data centers, office and industrial leasing driven by Americas which grew 17.8%, including 18.1% in the United States and the United Kingdom, which grew 15.3%. \nForeign currency translation had a 0.1% positive impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily driven by strength in the British pound sterling and euro, partially offset by weakness in the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar.\nCost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs increased 15.7%, primarily reflecting business growth and higher commission expense. Foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on total cost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs. Cost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs slightly increased to 57.4% of total revenue from 57.1% for the same period in 2024 primarily due to escalating commission payouts driven by strong revenue growth.\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased by 4.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher employee compensation, higher business promotion, advertising and travel expense, driven by growth in the business. Foreign currency translation had a 0.1% positive impact on total operating expenses.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, MSRs contributed $96 million to operating income, offset by $108 million of amortization of related intangible assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, MSRs contributed $74 million to operating income, offset by $104 million of amortization of related intangible assets. The increase was associated with higher origination activity given an increase in financing activities.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased 5.7% primarily due to higher amortization of mortgage servicing rights as described above. \n42\nTable of contents\nBuilding Operations & Experience\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for our Building Operations & Experience (BOE) operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, \n(1)\nNine Months Ended September 30, \n(1)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRevenue:\nFacilities management\n$\n5,137 \n88.7 \n%\n$\n4,638 \n90.1 \n%\n$\n15,024 \n88.8 \n%\n$\n13,263 \n90.2 \n%\nProperty management\n657 \n11.3 \n%\n507 \n9.9 \n%\n1,889 \n11.2 \n%\n1,437 \n9.8 \n%\nTotal segment revenue\n5,794 \n100.0 \n%\n5,145 \n100.0 \n%\n16,913 \n100.0 \n%\n14,700 \n100.0 \n%\nCosts and expenses:\nPass-through costs \n(2)\n3,085 \n53.2 \n%\n2,804 \n54.5 \n%\n9,147 \n54.1 \n%\n8,114 \n55.2 \n%\nCost of revenue, excluding pass-through costs\n2,119 \n36.6 \n%\n1,830 \n35.6 \n%\n6,095 \n36.0 \n%\n5,165 \n35.1 \n%\nOperating, administrative and other\n348 \n6.0 \n%\n282 \n5.5 \n%\n983 \n5.8 \n%\n885 \n6.0 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n65 \n1.1 \n%\n67 \n1.3 \n%\n196 \n1.2 \n%\n169 \n1.1 \n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n5,617 \n96.9 \n%\n4,983 \n96.9 \n%\n16,421 \n97.1 \n%\n14,333 \n97.5 \n%\nOperating income\n177 \n3.1 \n%\n162 \n3.1 \n%\n492 \n2.9 \n%\n367 \n2.5 \n%\nEquity income (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries\n3 \n0.1 \n%\n— \n0.0 \n%\n(14)\n(0.1)\n%\n4 \n0.0 \n%\nOther income (loss)\n1 \n0.0 \n%\n(1)\n0.0 \n%\n6 \n0.0 \n%\n1 \n0.0 \n%\nAdd-back: Depreciation and amortization\n65 \n1.1 \n%\n67 \n1.3 \n%\n196 \n1.2 \n%\n169 \n1.1 \n%\nAdjustments:\nIntegration and other costs related to acquisitions\n17 \n0.3 \n%\n5 \n0.1 \n%\n60 \n0.4 \n%\n35 \n0.2 \n%\nCosts associated with efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives\n— \n0.0 \n%\n11 \n0.2 \n%\n— \n0.0 \n%\n41 \n0.3 \n%\nNet results related to the wind-down of certain businesses \n(3)\n22 \n0.4 \n%\n— \n0.0 \n%\n22 \n0.1 \n%\n— \n0.0 \n%\nSegment operating profit\n$\n285 \n$\n244 \n$\n762 \n$\n617 \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nCalculated as a percentage of Total Revenue.\n(2)\nPass-through costs represent certain costs incurred associated with subcontracted third-party vendor work performed for clients.

Our AUM is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not to be the basis for determining our management fees. Our assets under management consist of:\n•\nthe total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing. Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our AUM. The value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost. In the case of real estate operating companies, the total value of real properties controlled by the companies, generally through joint ventures, is included in AUM; and\n•\nthe net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds investments.\nOur calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenue decreased 13.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily due to lower incentive fees and carried interest partially offset by higher asset management fees in our Investment Management business and lower construction management and development fees from development services.

Our expected capital requirements for 2025 include up to $339 million of anticipated capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we incurred $222 million of capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2025, we had aggregate future commitments of $187 million related to co-investments funds in our REI segment, $22 million of which is expected to be funded in 2025. Additionally, as of September 30, 2025, we are committed to fund additional capital of $357 million and $62 million to consolidated and unconsolidated projects, respectively, within our REI segment. As of September 30, 2025, we had $3.5 billion of borrowings available under our revolving credit facilities (under both the 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement and 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement, as described below, and the Turner & Townsend revolving credit facility) and $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We intend to maintain available commitments under the 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement in an amount at least equal to the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding from time to time. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had $1.1 billion and $175 million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.\nWe have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow, our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and general investment requirements (including in-fill acquisitions) and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements. In the absence of extraordinary events, large strategic acquisitions or large returns of capital to shareholders, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months. Given compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals are generally paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production, the negative effect of difficult market conditions is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. We may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive. We may also, from time to time in our sole discretion, purchase, redeem, or retire our existing senior notes, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, or otherwise.\nOn May 12, 2025, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.800% senior notes due in 2030 and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior notes due in 2035, generating aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion after offering expenses. On May 28, 2025, we used a portion of the proceeds from this offering to redeem in full the $600 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 4.875% senior notes due 2026. \nAs noted above, we believe that any future significant acquisitions we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing. In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable. However, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future.\nOur long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, are generally comprised of the following elements. The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness. If our cash flow is insufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates. We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.\nThe second long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions. Our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase consideration in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had accrued deferred purchase consideration totaling $339 million ($234 million of which was a current liability) and $292 million ($199 million of which was a current liability), respectively, which was included in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” and in “Other long-term liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\n52\nTable of contents\nLastly, as described in Note 14 – Income Per Share and Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, in November 2024, our Board of Directors (Board) authorized an additional $5.0 billion to our existing $4.0 billion share repurchase program (as amended, the 2024 program) bringing the total authorized amount under the 2024 program to a total of $9.0 billion as of September 30, 2025. The Board also extended the term of the 2024 program through December 31, 2029. \nWe did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2025 under the 2024 program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased 5,185,163 shares of our common stock with an average price of $127.82 per share for an aggregate of $663 million under the 2024 program. As of September 30, 2025, we had $5.2 billion of capacity remaining under the 2024 program.\nOur stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future repurchases with existing cash. We may utilize our stock repurchase programs to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program and on a more opportunistic basis if we believe our stock presents a compelling investment compared to other discretionary uses. The timing of any future repurchases and the actual amounts repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions and other factors.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $338 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $368 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The primary drivers that contributed to the decrease\n in \nnet cash provided by operating activities were as follows: working capital movements, driven by timing of cash receipts and payment to vendors, partially offset by higher cash flows from earnings, driven by revenue growth.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $664 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $1,494 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $830 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash outflows from acquisitions in the current period (primarily consisting of the acquisition of Industrious), compared to the prior period when we acquired J&J Worldwide Services and Direct Line. \nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $832 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $927 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decreased cash inflow was primarily driven by cash paid to repurchase common stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, offset by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in the current period, compared to the prior period.\n53\nTable of contents\nIndebtedness\nWe use a variety of financing arrangements, both long-term and short-term, to fund our operations in addition to cash generated from operating activities. We also use several funding sources to avoid becoming overly dependent on one financing source, and to lower funding costs.\nLong-Term Debt\nOn July 10, 2023, CBRE Group, Inc., CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE Services) and Relam Amsterdam Holdings B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Services (Relam Borrower), entered into a new 5-year senior unsecured Credit Agreement (2023 Credit Agreement) maturing on July 10, 2028, which refinanced and replaced the previous credit agreement. The 2023 Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured term loan credit facility comprised of (i) tranche A Euro-denominated term loans in an aggregate principal amount of €367 million (Tranche A (Euro) Loans) and (ii) tranche A U.S. Dollar-denominated term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million (Tranche A (USD) Loans) with weighted average interest rate of 4.0% as of September 30, 2025, both requiring quarterly principal payments beginning on December 31, 2024 and continuing through maturity on July 10, 2028. The proceeds of these term loans under the 2023 Credit Agreement were applied to the repayment of all remaining outstanding senior term loans, approximately $437 million, under the previous credit agreement, the payment of related fees and expenses and other general corporate purposes.\nOn March 13, 2025, CBRE Group, Inc., CBRE Services and Relam Borrower entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2023 Credit Agreement, which provided for, among other things, the ability of Relam Borrower to obtain incremental commitments and loans under the 2023 Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million (or the Euro equivalent). On March 14, 2025, CBRE Group, Inc., CBRE Services and Relam Borrower entered into Amendment No. 2 and Incremental Assumption Agreement to the 2023 Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Relam Borrower incurred incremental term loans (i) denominated in Euros in the aggregate principal amount of €425 million (Incremental Euro Term Loans) and (ii) denominated in U.S. Dollars in the aggregate principal amount of $125 million (Incremental USD Term Loans). The Incremental Euro Term Loans have the same terms applicable to, and constitute the same class as, the Tranche A (Euro) Loans, and the Incremental USD Term Loans have the same terms applicable to, and constitute the same class as, the Tranche A (USD) Loans under the 2023 Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the Incremental Euro Term Loans and the Incremental USD Term Loans were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes (including the partial repayment of borrowings under the commercial paper program) and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with entering into the amendments to the 2023 Credit Agreement. On June 24, 2025, CBRE Group, Inc., CBRE Services and Relam Borrower entered into Amendment No. 3 to the 2023 Credit Agreement, for the purpose of, among other things, amending the financial covenants to remove the interest coverage ratio covenant and to increase certain baskets and thresholds in the 2023 Credit Agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreements described below.\nThe term loan borrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by CBRE Group, Inc. and CBRE Services.\nOn May 12, 2025, CBRE Services issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.800% senior notes due June 15, 2030 (the 4.800% senior notes) at a price equal to 99.065% of their face value.

We redeemed these notes in full on May 28, 2025. This redemption was funded using net proceeds from the offering of our 4.800% senior notes and 2035 5.500% senior notes.\nThe indentures governing our outstanding senior notes described above contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create or permit liens on assets securing indebtedness, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and enter into consolidations or mergers. \nOur senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CBRE Group, Inc.\nCombined summarized financial information for CBRE Group, Inc.

All intercompany balances and transactions between CBRE Group, Inc. and CBRE Services have been eliminated.\nFor additional information on all of our long-term debt, see Note 11 – Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 included in our \n2024 Annual Report\n and Note 10 – Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\n55\nTable of contents\nShort-Term Borrowings\nOn June 24, 2025, we entered into a new 5-year senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (the 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement) which replaced our prior revolving credit agreement dated August 5, 2022. The 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility available to CBRE Services with commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3.5 billion and a maturity date of June 24, 2030. \nThe 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to pay a fee based on the total amount of the revolving credit facility commitment (whether used or unused). In addition, the 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement also includes capacity for letters of credit not to exceed $300 million in the aggregate and capacity for swingline loans not to exceed $300 million in the aggregate. The 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CBRE Group, Inc.\nAs of September 30, 2025, no amount was outstanding under the revolving credit facility provided for by the 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement. $61 million of letters of credit were outstanding as of September 30, 2025. Letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business and would reduce the amount we may borrow under this revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, $132 million was outstanding under our prior revolving credit facility. No letters of credit were outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\nOn June 24, 2025, we entered into a new 364-day senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement, and together with the 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreements). The 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility available to CBRE Services with commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion and a maturity date of June 23, 2026.\nThe 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to pay a fee based on the total amount of the revolving credit facility commitment (whether used or unused). The 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CBRE Group, Inc.\nAs of September 30, 2025, no amount was outstanding under the revolving credit facility provided for by the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOn December 2, 2024, CBRE Services established a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue and sell up to $3.5 billion of short-term, unsecured and unsubordinated commercial paper notes with up to 397-day maturities, under the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. Payment of the commercial paper notes is guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by CBRE Group, Inc. The program notes and the guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The proceeds from issuances under the program may be used for general corporate purposes. The company intends to maintain available commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement in an amount at least equal to the amount of commercial paper notes outstanding from time to time. As of September 30, 2025, we had $1.1 billion in outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program with a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.34%. As of October 20, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had $1.0 billion and $175 million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.\nIn addition, Turner & Townsend maintains a £120 million revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement dated March 31, 2022, with an additional accordion option of £20 million, that matures on March 31, 2027. As of September 30, 2025, no amount was outstanding under this revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, $44 million (£35 million) was outstanding under this revolving credit facility.\nFor additional information on all of our short-term borrowings, see Note 5 – Warehouse Receivables & Warehouse Lines of Credit and Note 11 – Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 included in our \n2024 Annual Report\n and Note 4 – Warehouse Receivables & Warehouse Lines of Credit and Note 10 – Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\nWe also maintain warehouse lines of credit with certain third-party lenders. See Note 4 – Warehouse Receivables & Warehouse Lines of Credit of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. \n56\nTable of contents\nOff –Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe could have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are described in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and are incorporated by reference herein.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. A discussion of such critical accounting policies, which include revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, contingencies, and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries – fair value option can be found in our \n2024 Annual Report\n. There have been no material changes to these policies and estimates as of September 30, 2025.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 – New Accounting Pronouncements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\n57\nTable of contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCore EBITDA are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We generally use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. We believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected costs and charges that may obscure the underlying performance of our business and related trends. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of core EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWe use core EBITDA as an indicator of the company’s ongoing operating financial performance. Core EBITDA represents earnings before depreciation and amortization, net interest expense and income taxes, further adjusted for the following items:\n•\nwrite-off of financing costs on extinguished debt,\n•\nintegration and other costs related to acquisitions,\n•\ncarried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue,\n•\ncharges related to indirect tax audits and settlements,\n•\nnet results related to the wind-down of certain businesses,\n•\nthe impact of fair value adjustments related to unconsolidated equity investments, \n•\nbusiness and finance transformation,\n•\nefficiency and cost-reduction initiatives,\n•\ncosts incurred related to legal entity restructuring,\n•\nnet fair value adjustments on strategic non-core investments, and\n•\nprovision associated with Telford’s fire safety remediation efforts.\nWe believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending.\nCore EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our discretionary use because it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. This measure may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt. We also use core EBITDA as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.\n58\nTable of contents\nCore EBITDA is calculated as follows (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc.\n$\n363 \n$\n225 \n$\n741 \n$\n481 \nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\n33 \n20 \n86 \n54 \nNet income\n396 \n245 \n827 \n535 \nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization\n181 \n178 \n540 \n497 \nInterest expense, net of interest income\n50 \n64 \n159 \n163 \nWrite-off of financing costs on extinguished debt\n— \n— \n2 \n— \nProvision for income taxes\n91 \n67 \n203 \n70 \nIntegration and other costs related to acquisitions\n60 \n22 \n204 \n30 \nCarried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue\n3 \n(4)\n10 \n12 \nCharges related to indirect tax audits and settlements\n— \n25 \n(1)\n39 \nNet results related to the wind-down of certain businesses \n(1)\n30 \n— \n44 \n— \nImpact of fair value non-cash adjustments related to unconsolidated equity investments\n— \n9 \n2 \n9 \nBusiness and finance transformation\n10 \n— \n38 \n— \nCosts associated with efficiency and cost-reduction initiatives\n— \n41 \n13 \n137 \nCosts incurred related to legal entity restructuring\n— \n— \n— \n2 \nNet fair value adjustments on strategic non-core investments\n— \n8 \n(22)\n91 \nProvision associated with Telford’s fire safety remediation efforts\n— \n33 \n— \n33 \nCore EBITDA\n$\n821 \n$\n688 \n$\n2,019 \n$\n1,618 \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1)    \nIn the first quarter of 2025, management made the decision to wind down Telford Homes’ legacy construction business.
