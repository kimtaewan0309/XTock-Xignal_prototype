  "item1": "Item 1.\nBusiness.\n \nGeneral Development of Business  \n \nGeneral\n \nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a Virginia holding company incorporated in 1987.  In March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").  We are a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, we have invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\") – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies’ \nIQOS\n and \nZYN\n brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match’s \nGeneral \nsnus and \nZYN \nnicotine pouches and versions of PMI’s \nIQOS \ndevices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. Versions of \nIQOS \ndevices and consumables\n \nand \nGeneral\n snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\") authorizations from the FDA. We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of Item 7. \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n. \nThrough our acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022, with its leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S. under the \nZYN\n brand name, we acquired a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market. The Swedish Match acquisition has been a key milestone in PMI’s transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our existing portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading heat-not-burn product.  By joining forces with Swedish Match, we expect to accelerate the achievement of our joint smoke-free ambitions, switching more adults who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes to better alternatives faster than either company could achieve separately. \nIn 2022, we reached an agreement with Altria Group, Inc. to end our commercial relationship in the U.S. covering \nIQOS\n as of April 30, 2024. PMI now holds the full rights to commercialize \nIQOS\n in the U.S.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n.\n \nIn 2021, we began our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare given our strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences. Our Wellness and Healthcare business strategy currently focuses on developing and commercializing oral and inhaled consumer health and wellness offerings and inhaled prescription products for therapy areas that include pain management and cardiovascular emergencies. This includes medical and pharmaceutical cannabinoids, and non-recreational cannabinoid products (including CBD), in line with applicable regulatory requirements, though any revenue related to cannabinoids is expected to be negligible in the near to medium term.\nSmoke-Free Business (\"SFB”) is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its smoke-free products. SFB also includes wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories, such as lighters and matches.  \nSmoke-free products (also referred to herein as \"SFPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its products that provide nicotine without combusting tobacco, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral smokeless, and that therefore generate far lower levels of harmful chemicals. As such, these products have the potential to present less risk of harm versus continued smoking. \nWe have a range of SFPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization.  Our smoke-free products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and adult users of nicotine-containing products. We put significant effort to restrict access of our products from non-smokers and youth. We believe regulation must include measures designed to prevent youth initiation; and we also support and engage with relevant authorities to seek sensible regulation of flavors, mandated health warnings and minimum age laws.\nOur \nIQOS \nsmoke-free\n \nproduct brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products. It uses a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTUs\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our \nBLENDS\n, \nDELIA\n, \nHEETS\n,\n HEETS Creations \n(defined collectively as \"\nHEETS\n\"), \nSENTIA\n,\n TEREA,\n \nTEREA CRAFTED and TEREA Dimensions,\n as well \n1\nas the KT&G-licensed brands, \nFiit\n and \nMiix\n (outside of South Korea). HTUs also include zero tobacco heat-not-burn consumables (\nLEVIA\n). \nIQOS\n was first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014.  \nIQOS\n and \nZYN\n are the leading brands in our SFPs portfolio. As of December 31, 2024, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets.  With regard to nicotine pouches, we increased our presence to 37 markets. \nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 170 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by \nMarlboro\n, the world’s best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 40% of our total 2024 cigarette shipment volume. \nMarlboro \nis complemented in the premium-price category by \nParliament\n. Our other leading international cigarette brands are \nChesterfield, L&M\n, and \nPhilip Morris. \nThese five international cigarette brands contributed 80% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2024. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as \nDji Sam Soe \nand \nSampoerna A \nin Indonesia, and \nFortune \nand \nJackpot \nin the Philippines.  \nSource of Funds — Dividends  \n \n \nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law, including governmental capital and foreign currency exchange controls.\n \nDescription of Business \n \nFollowing the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the four existing geographical segments. Our four geographical segments are as follows: \n•\nEurope Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe; \n•\nSouth and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS & MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.  It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n•\nEast Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU & PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia & Australia; and\n•\nAmericas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.  \nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\nFollowing the sale of Vectura Group Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness & Healthcare results in the Europe segment.  In addition, we will be renaming our “PMI Duty Free” business to “PMI Global Travel Retail” effective in the first quarter of 2025.  As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia & PMI Global Travel Retail (“EA, AU & PMI GTR”).  As of the first quarter of 2025, our reporting will reflect these changes.\nOur total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 2.5% in 2024 to 756.6 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 139.7 billion units in 2024, up from 125.3 billion units in 2023.  Shipment volume of our principal cigarette brand, \nMarlboro\n, increased by 3.7% in 2024. \nReferences in this Form 10-K to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States, total industry (or total market) and market shares, are our estimates for tax-paid products based on data from a number of internal and external sources, and may, in defined instances, exclude China.  Past reported periods may be updated to ensure comparability and to incorporate the most current information for industry and market share reporting.\n2\nUnless otherwise stated, references to total industry (or total market), our shipment volume and our market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units.  \nKey data regarding total market and market share were as follows:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal Market, billion units (excluding China and the U.S.)\n2,618\n2,579\n2,621\nTotal International Market Share \n(1) \n28.7%\n28.3%\n27.7%\nCigarettes\n23.5%\n23.7%\n23.6%\nHTU\n5.2%\n4.7%\n4.1%\nPMI Cigarette over Cigarette Market Share \n(2)\n25.3%\n25.2%\n25.0%\nMarlboro\n Cigarette over Cigarette Market Share \n(3)\n10.1%\n9.8%\n9.8%\n(1) Defined as PMI's cigarette and heated tobacco unit in-market sales volume as a percentage of total industry cigarette and heated tobacco unit sales volume, excluding China and the U.S., including cigarillos in Japan\n(2) Defined as PMI's cigarette in-market sales volume as a percentage of total industry cigarette sales volume, excluding China and the U.S., including cigarillos in Japan\n(3) Defined as \nMarlboro\n's cigarette in-market sales volume as a percentage of total industry cigarette sales volume, excluding China and the U.S., including cigarillos in Japan\nNote: Sum of share of market by product categories might not foot to total due to roundings\nWe have a market share of at least 15% in approximately 100 markets, including Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the Slovak Republic, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine. \n \nDistribution & Sales  \n \nOur main types of distribution and sales are tailored to the characteristics of each market and are often used simultaneously: \n \n•\nDirect sales and distribution, where we sell directly to the retailers; \n•\nDistribution through independent distributors that often distribute other fast-moving consumer goods and are responsible for distribution in a particular market;\n•\nExclusive zonified distribution, where the dedicated multicategory product distributors are assigned to exclusive territories within a market;   \n•\nDistribution through national or regional wholesalers that then supply the retail trade; \n•\nOur own e-commerce infrastructure for product sales to trade partners and to consumers; and \n•\nOur own brand retail infrastructure for our SFPs and accessories for sales to consumers. \n \n3\nCompetition \n    \n \nWe are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price.\nThe competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions; erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; adult smoker willingness to convert to our SFPs; higher product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products, restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our SFPs, or disproportionately impacts the commercialization of our products in relation to our competitors. \nCompetitors in our industry include Altria Group, Inc., British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Some competitors have different profit, volume and regulatory objectives, and some international competitors may be less susceptible than PMI to changes in currency exchange rates. Certain new market entrants in the non-combustible product category may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, and without scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our SFPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. \nProcurement and Raw Materials    \n \n \nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent international tobacco suppliers. In 2024, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2024, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 18% of PMI’s global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States. We believe that there is a sufficient supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements.\nGiven the global reach of our value chain, properly managing land and water resources and utilizing a geographically diversified sourcing strategy for agricultural products are priorities as we seek to increase the resilience of our production systems and minimize operational risks. We conduct a global water risk assessment annually in tobacco-growing regions to identify potential hotspots for physical water risks that require adaptation measures. Our water stewardship strategy includes guidance for applying a landscape approach to water optimization projects, protecting natural resources and recharge areas, and improving the efficiency of irrigation systems to integrate better farm water management. These business practices are intended to mitigate the risk that climate change could influence weather patterns in ways that negatively impact the quality or cost of the agricultural products used to manufacture our products. \nIn addition to tobacco leaf, we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 500 suppliers. In 2024, our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represented approximately 60% of our total direct materials purchases. The four most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging, acetate tow used in filter making, fine paper used in the manufacturing of cigarettes and heated tobacco units, and susceptors used for \nTEREA\n and other consumables. In addition, the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our Indonesian business. For our oral smoke-free products, direct materials include plastic cans and lids for nicotine pouches and traditional snus products, nicotine salt or nicotine premix for nicotine pouches, pouch material for individual pouchmaking and additives. Our devices are made by various electronic manufacturing services providers (\"EMS\"). The components used in the assembly of these devices can be made by the EMS or purchased from other suppliers. These components include mechanical parts, electrical and electromechanical components,  batteries, semiconductors, and packaging materials.  \nWe discuss the details of our supply chain for our SFPs in Item 7. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Item 7”) in\n Business Environment—Reduced-Risk Products\n.\n \nBusiness Environment   \nInformation called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs in Item 7, \nBusiness Environment\n to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \n4\nOther Matters\n \nCustomers   \n \nAs described in more detail in “\nDistribution & Sales\n” above, in many of our markets we sell our products to distributors. In 2024, sales to a distributor in the Europe Region and a distributor in the EA, AU & PMI DF Region each amounted to 10 percent or more of our consolidated net revenues. See Item 8, Note 13. \nSegment Reporting\n for more information.  We believe that none of our business segments is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. In some of our markets, particularly in the Europe, SSEA, CIS & MEA, and EA, AU & PMI DF Regions, a loss of a distributor may result in a temporary market disruption. \n \nHuman Capital\n \n     \n \nOur Workforce\n.\n At December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 83,100 people worldwide, including full-time, temporary and part-time staff. Our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees. Generally, these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business. We engage with legally recognized employee representative bodies and we have collective bargaining agreements in several of the countries in which we operate. In addition, in accordance with E.U. requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We believe we maintain good relations with our employees and their representative organizations. \nOur Internal Transformation\n. To be successful in our transformation to a smoke-free future, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent with our business needs, successfully integrate acquired businesses and innovate to become a truly consumer-centric business.  To achieve our strategic goals, we need to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best global talent, talent that is diverse and has  the right degree of experience, competencies and skills. Our compensation and benefit programs are set at the levels that we believe are necessary to attract the best talent and remain competitive with other consumer product companies.\nOversight and Management\n. Our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") provides oversight of various matters pertaining to our workforce. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board is responsible for executive compensation matters and oversight of the risks and programs related to human capital management. Our Code of Conduct and Corporate Governance Guidelines highlight our commitment to ethical business conduct and honesty, respect, and fairness.\nCollaborative Culture\n. We are proud of the global reach of our company, which operates in approximately 170 markets with employees representing more than 130 nationalities. We reflect the demographics of the countries, communities, and consumers we serve, which is key to the variety of thought, innovation, and consumer-centric approach that enables us to deliver a smoke-free future.\nOur focus is on fostering a performance-driven and collaborative culture, recognizing the value of our global workforce and their contributions. We remain committed to the impact, growth, and well-being of our employees, providing them with the right environment, support, and resources for their careers and professional development.\nThese principles are codified in our cultural values, which we call the PMI DNA, and we embed these principles throughout our people and business guidelines, practices, and systems.\nAs the first multinational company to receive a global EQUAL-SALARY certification from the EQUAL-SALARY Foundation in 2019, we completed another year of market level reviews with success and maintained our global certification. We believe this certification is a valuable component in our reputation as an employer.\nGovernment Regulation\n \nAs a company with global operations in a heavily regulated industry, we are subject to multiple laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  We discuss our regulatory environment in Item 7, \nBusiness Environment\n.  \nThe regulatory landscape related to sustainability matters is rapidly evolving. We closely monitor these developments and implement initiatives addressing PMI’s priorities in line with our sustainability strategy. In particular, we are subject to international, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. We have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements and reduce our carbon footprint, wastage, as well as water and energy consumption. We report externally about our climate change mitigation strategy, together with associated targets and results in reducing our carbon footprint, through CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), the leading international non-governmental organization assessing the work of thousands of companies worldwide in the area of environmental impact, including climate change. \n5\nOur environmental and occupational health and safety management program includes policies, standard practices and procedures at all our manufacturing centers. Furthermore, we have engaged an external certification body to validate the effectiveness of this management program at our manufacturing centers around the world, in accordance with internationally recognized standards ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 for safety and environmental management. Furthermore, we progressively certify our manufacturing centers against AWS (Alliance for Water Stewardship) and Carbon Neutrality, requiring improvement actions year on year. Our subsidiaries expect to continue to make investments in order to drive improved performance and maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We assess and report to our management the compliance status of all our legal entities on a regular basis. Based on current regulations, the management and controls we have in place and our review of climate change risks (both physical and regulatory), environmental expenditures have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position, earnings or competitive position.\nAs discussed in more detail in Item 1A.\n Risk Factors\n, our financial results could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives that could result in a significant decrease in demand for our brands or by climate-related regulations that increase our cost of operation. More specifically, any regulatory requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers' ability to convert to our SFPs, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Further, tightened climate-related regulation may lead to additional carbon taxation or energy price increases impacting our cost of operation. These shifts in regulation and other market trends could, amongst others, impact current deforestation rates. Availability of deforestation-free materials could be impacted by increased demand for alternative energy sources and low-carbon fuels, such as biomass, which could result in increased sourcing costs.\nWe discuss additional information regarding regulatory matters relating to climate change in Item 7, \nClimate Change Laws and Regulations.\n \nInformation About Our Executive Officers      \nThe disclosure regarding executive officers is hereby incorporated by reference to the discussion under the heading “Information about our Executive Officers as of February 6, 2025” in Part III, Item 10. \nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\n of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Item 10”).\nIntellectual Property   \nOur trademarks are valuable assets, and their protection and reputation are essential to us. We own the trademark rights to all of our principal brands, including \nMarlboro \n(outside of the U.S.), \nHEETS, IQOS\n, \nIQOS ILUMA,\n \nTEREA\n, \nVEEV\n and \nZYN,\n or have the right to use them in all countries in which these brands are advertised or sold.\n \nIn addition, we have a large number of granted patents and pending patent applications worldwide. Our patent portfolio, as a whole, is material to our business. However, no one patent, or group of related patents, is material to us. We also have registered industrial designs, as well as unregistered proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other unregistered intellectual property rights.\n \nEffective January 1, 2008, PMI entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement with Philip Morris USA Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“PM USA”). The Intellectual Property Agreement allocates ownership of jointly funded intellectual property as follows:\n•\nPMI owns all rights to jointly funded intellectual property outside the United States, its territories and possessions; and\n•\nPM USA owns all rights to jointly funded intellectual property in the United States, its territories and possessions.\nThe parties agreed to submit disputes under the Intellectual Property Agreement first to negotiation between senior executives and then to binding arbitration.\nAn agreement was reached with PM USA in 2022 relating to \nIQOS\n commercialization rights in the U.S. including, among other things, an agreement relating to intellectual property rights consistent with the commercialization rights for relevant \nIQOS\n products.\nOn February 1, 2024, Philip Morris Products S.A., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of PMI, and Nicoventures Trading Limited, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of British American Tobacco p.l.c., entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) for an eight-year term, under which, among other things: (i) certain pending legal proceedings (the “Proceedings”) between them concerning certain of their respective products were dismissed with prejudice, subject to certain limited exceptions, and \n6\nwithout admission of liability; (ii) the Limited Exclusion Order and Cease and Desist Order issued by the International Trade Commission on September 29, 2021, prohibiting the importation of certain heat-not-burn products by PMI and its affiliates into the United States was rescinded; and (iii) any injunctions granted to either party in the Proceedings were fully and finally discharged, without admission of liability. \nThe parties have also agreed to certain covenants not to sue on a perpetual, royalty-free basis or on a royalty-bearing basis, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement, and, among other things, both parties may introduce certain heat-not-burn and vapor products under the Settlement Agreement (including certain evolutions of the existing heat-not-burn and e-vapor products, and certain variants and product line extensions of heat-not-burn and e-vapor products), which products may be royalty-bearing or royalty-free depending on the patents of the other party that may have been used in the development thereof. \nSeasonality    \n \nOur business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality, although in certain markets cigarette consumption may be lower during the winter months due to the cold weather and may rise during the summer months due to outdoor use, longer daylight, and tourism. However, we typically experience higher SFP adult user growth in the first half of each year versus the second half of each year due to seasonal influences.\nAvailable Information    \n \nWe are required to file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

  "item7": "Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results in Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n.\nDescription of Our Company\n \nWe are a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future. We are evolving our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, we have invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\") – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies’ \nIQOS\n and \nZYN\n brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match’s \nGeneral \nsnus and \nZYN \nnicotine pouches and versions of PMI’s \nIQOS \ndevices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. Versions of \nIQOS \ndevices and consumables\n \nand \nGeneral\n snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\") authorizations from the FDA. We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of this Item 7. \nFollowing the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the four existing geographical segments. Our four geographical segments are as follows: \n•\nEurope Region; \n•\nSouth and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS & MEA\"); \n•\nEast Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU & PMI DF\"); and \n•\nAmericas Region. \nOur Wellness and Healthcare segment (\"W&H\") remained unchanged in 2024.\nFollowing the sale of Vectura Group Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness & Healthcare results in the Europe segment.  In addition, we will be renaming our “PMI Duty Free” business to “PMI Global Travel Retail” effective in the first quarter of 2025.  As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia & PMI Global Travel Retail (“EA, AU & PMI GTR”).  As of the first quarter of 2025, our reporting will reflect these changes.\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 170 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands.  Our\n \nportfolio comprises both international and local brands. \nSmoke-Free Business (\"SFB”) is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its smoke-free products. SFB also includes wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories, such as lighters and matches.  \nSmoke-free products (also referred to herein as \"SFPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to all of its products that provide nicotine without combusting tobacco, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral smokeless, and that therefore generate far lower levels of harmful chemicals. As such, these products have the potential to present less risk of harm versus continued smoking. \n25\nIQOS\n and \nZYN\n are the leading brands in our SFPs portfolio. As of December 31, 2024, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets.  \nOur Wellness and Healthcare business strategy focuses on developing and commercializing oral and inhaled consumer health and wellness offerings and inhaled prescription products for therapy areas that include pain management and cardiovascular emergencies.  This includes medical and pharmaceutical cannabinoids, and non-recreational cannabinoid products (including CBD), in line with applicable regulatory requirements, though any revenue related to cannabinoids is expected to be negligible in the near to medium term.\nIn 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB, a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market. The Swedish Match acquisition was a key milestone in PMI’s transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading heat-not-burn product.\nIn 2022, we reached an agreement with Altria Group, Inc. to end our commercial relationship in the U.S. covering \nIQOS\n as of April 30, 2024. PMI now holds the full rights to commercialize \nIQOS\n in the U.S.  \nFor further details of our 2022 acquisition of Swedish Match, as well as the agreement with Altria Group, Inc. discussed above, see Item 8, Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures \nand the \"Business Environment\" section of this Item 7.\nWe use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes.  Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell.  Mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix).  Mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix).  \nOur cost of sales consists principally of: tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs; shipping and handling costs; and the cost of devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers.  Estimated costs associated with device warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.\nOur marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products.  The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its direct and indirect subsidiaries.  Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized.  As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law, including governmental capital and foreign currency exchange controls.\n26\nExecutive Summary \nThe following executive summary provides the business update and significant highlights from the \nDiscussion and Analysis\n that follows.\nImpairment Related to the Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Equity Investment \nOn October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement (“Proposed Plan”) setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately $22.3 billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing.  On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Item 8, Note 18. \nContingencies\n). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion among RBH, ITL, and JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI’s investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in RBH was lower than its carrying value.  As a result, PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million (representing a diluted EPS charge of $1.49 per share) in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. \nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other\n.\nConsolidated Operating Results\n•\nNet Revenues –\n Net revenues of $37.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased by $2.7 billion, or 7.7%, from the comparable 2023 amount.  The change in our net revenues from the comparable 2023 amount was driven by the following (variances not to scale): \n \nNet revenues increased by 7.7%. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 10.1%, mainly reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, primarily driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; and favorable volume/mix, driven by higher smoke-free products volume, partly offset by unfavorable cigarette mix, as well as a favorable comparison to 2023 reflecting a charge in the first quarter of 2023 of $80 million following the termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East, shown in \"Other.\" The termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East is further described in the following \"\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n\" discussion.  \n27\nNet revenues by product category for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, are shown below: \n \n        \n28\n•\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n \n–\n The changes in our reported diluted earnings per share (“diluted EPS”) for the year ended December 31, 2024, from the comparable 2023 amounts, were as follows:  \nDiluted EPS\n% Change\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\n$\n5.02\n \n2023 Charges related to the war in Ukraine\n0.03\n \n2023 Restructuring charges\n0.06\n \n2023 South Korea indirect tax charge\n0.11\n \n2023 Termination of agreement with Foundation for a Smoke-Free World\n0.07\n \n2023 Fair value adjustment for equity security investments\n(0.02)\n2023 Amortization of intangibles\n0.25\n \n2023 Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles\n0.44\n \n2023 Termination of distribution arrangement in the Middle East\n0.04\n \n2023 Swedish Match AB acquisition accounting related items\n0.01\n \n2023 Income tax impact associated with Swedish Match AB financing\n(0.11)\n2023 Tax items\n0.11\n \nSubtotal of 2023 items\n0.99\n \n2024 Restructuring charges\n(0.10)\n2024 Impairment of other intangibles\n(0.01)\n2024 Fair value adjustment for equity security investments\n0.27\n \n2024 Impairment related to RBH equity investment\n(1.49)\n2024 Amortization of intangibles\n(0.40)\n2024 Loss on sale of Vectura Group\n(0.13)\n2024 Egypt sales tax charge\n(0.03)\n2024 Megapolis localization tax impact\n(0.05)\n2024 Income tax impact associated with Swedish Match AB financing\n(0.14)\n2024 Tax items \n0.03\n \nSubtotal of 2024 items\n(2.05)\nCurrency\n(0.38)\nInterest\n(0.03)\nChange in tax rate\n(0.07)\nOperations\n1.04\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\n$\n4.52\n \n(10.0)\n%\nCharges related to the war in Ukraine – \nDuring 2023, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $53 million (representing $43 million net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of $0.03 per share), related to circumstances driven by the war, including the cost of PMI’s humanitarian efforts, severance payments, as well as an impairment of certain long-lived assets. For further details, see Item 8, Note 4. \nWar in Ukraine\n.  \nRestructuring charges –\n During 2023, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of\n \n$109 million \n (representing\n $96 million\n net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of \n$0.06\n \nper share), related to a project to fully outsource and restructure the manufacturing of e-vapor devices and consumables. During 2024, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of\n $180 million (representing $150 million net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of \n$0.10\n \nper share), related to the restructuring of the sourcing of \nIQOS\n products to be commercialized in the U.S., and the cessation of our operations in Venezuela. For further details, see Item 8, Note 20. \nRestructuring Activities\n. \n29\nSouth Korea indirect tax charge\n \n– \nOn July 13, 2023, our South Korean subsidiary, PM Korea, received an adverse ruling from the Supreme Court of South Korea related to cases alleging underpayment of excise taxes in connection with a 2015 excise tax increase and subsequent audit by the South Korean Board of Audit and Inspection. The Supreme Court ruling reversed previous decisions that were in PM Korea’s favor at the trial and appellate levels. As a result of the ruling, we concluded that an adverse outcome was probable. Consequently, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $204 million (representing $174 million net of income tax or $0.11 per share decrease in diluted EPS) in the second quarter results of 2023, reflecting the full amount previously paid by PM Korea. \nTermination of agreement with Foundation for a Smoke-Free World\n – On September 29, 2023, PMI and the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World (the \"Foundation\") entered into the Final Grant Agreement and Termination of the Second Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement (\"Agreement\").  Under the terms of the Agreement, PMI paid $140 million in the third quarter of 2023 in return for the termination of the pledge agreement between the parties. As a result, in the third quarter of 2023, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $140 million (representing $111 million net of income tax or $0.07 per share decrease in diluted EPS) commensurate with the early termination of the pledge agreement. The pre-tax charge was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings during the year ended December 31, 2023. For further details, see \n\"Other Developments\"\n within the Business Environment section of this Item 7.\nFair value adjustment for equity security investments – \nDuring 2023, we recorded a favorable fair value adjustment for our equity security investments in India and Sri Lanka of $38 million after tax (or $0.02 per share increase in diluted EPS). During 2024, we recorded a favorable fair value adjustment for our equity security investments in India and Sri Lanka of $418 million after tax (or $0.27 per share increase in diluted EPS). For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. \nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other\n.  \nAmortization of intangibles\n \n– \nDuring 2023 and 2024, we recorded amortization of intangible expense of $497 million (representing $389 million net of income tax or $0.25 per share decrease in diluted EPS) and $835 million (representing $629 million net of income tax or $0.40 per share decrease in diluted EPS), respectively. The higher amortization expense in 2024 included the reacquired rights recorded as other intangible assets, net following the reacquisition of \nIQOS \ncommercialization rights in the U.S. from Altria Group, Inc. For further details, see Item 8, Note 5. \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\n.\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangibles – \nDuring the second quarter of 2023, as a result of the completion of our annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment, it was determined that the estimated fair value of the Wellness and Healthcare reporting unit was lower than its carrying value. Consequently, we recorded a total non-cash impairment charge of $680 million (representing a $0.44 per share decrease in diluted EPS) consisting of a goodwill impairment charge of $665 million and a non-amortizable intangible asset pre-tax impairment charge of $15 million for an in-process research and development project related to one of our 2021 acquisitions. The impairment charge was recorded in impairment of goodwill ($665 million) and marketing, administration and research costs ($15 million) in the consolidated statements of earnings during the year ended December 31, 2023 and was included in the Wellness and Healthcare segment results. During the first quarter of 2024, we recorded an impairment charge of $27 million (representing $20 million net of income tax or $0.01 per share decrease in diluted EPS), primarily reflecting the impairment of non-amortizable intangible assets related to an in-process research and development project in the Wellness and Healthcare segment. The impairment charge of $27 million was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings during the year ended December 31, 2024. For further details, see Item 8, Note 5. \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\n. \nTermination of distribution arrangement in the Middle East\n – Following the termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $80 million in the first quarter of 2023 (representing $70 million net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of $0.04 per share). The pre-tax charge was recorded as a reduction of net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023 and was included in the SSEA, CIS & MEA segment results.\nSwedish Match AB acquisition accounting related items\n – During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded pre-tax purchase accounting adjustments of $18 million related to the sale of acquired inventories stepped up to fair value (representing $13 million net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of $0.01 per share).  These pre-tax adjustments were recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023. For further details, see Item 8, Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n. \nLoss on sale of Vectura Group – \nIn September 2024, we announced the execution of a definitive agreement to sell Vectura to Molex Asia Holdings Ltd. On December 31, 2024, we completed the sale. The sale resulted in a pre-tax loss of $199 million (representing $206 million including the tax costs or a diluted EPS charge of $0.13 per share). This pre-tax loss was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in PMI’s consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, \n30\nand was included in the Wellness and Healthcare segment results. For further details, see Item 8, Note 3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n. \nEgypt sales tax charge\n \n– \nIn the third quarter of 2024, following a ruling issued by the Higher Administrative Court in Egypt and subsequent evaluation of available remedies, we concluded that an adverse outcome was probable and recorded a pre-tax charge of $45 million (representing $39 million net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of $0.03 per share) in relation to tax assessments for general sales tax deducted on imported cutfiller for the years 2014 to 2016. This pre-tax charge was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, and was included in the SSEA, CIS & MEA segment results.\nMegapolis localization tax impact\n – PMI holds a 23% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution B.V. (\"MDBV\"), which was the holding company of JSC TK Megapolis (formerly CJSC TK Megapolis), pursuant to Dutch law, PMI's distributor in Russia.  In June 2024, the Russian government included JSC TK Megapolis in the list of economically significant organizations that may be subject to forced localization under applicable Russian law, which refers to the mandatory removal of a foreign holding company from the shareholding structure. On August 8, 2024, the Arbitrazh Court of the Moscow Region granted the forced localization of MDBV as requested by the Ministry of Industry and Trade on July 18, 2024.  As a result, MDBV’s shares in JSC TK Megapolis were transferred to JSC TK Megapolis and subsequently transferred to the Russian subsidiary of its indirect shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result of the transfer of shares, PMI recorded a tax charge of $77 million (representing a diluted EPS charge of $0.05 per share). This charge primarily reflected additional deferred withholding taxes related to the JSC TK Megapolis pre-localization earnings and other adjustments of accumulated earnings of the Russian subsidiary.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. \nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other\n. \nImpairment related to the RBH equity investment\n – On October 17, 2024, the court-appointed mediator and monitor in the CCAA proceedings filed a proposed plan of compromise and arrangement (“Proposed Plan”) setting forth, among other things, certain terms of a proposed comprehensive resolution of Canadian tobacco claims and related litigation. Under the resolution contemplated by the Proposed Plan, RBH, Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (\"ITL\") and JTI Macdonald Corp (\"JTIM\") would pay an aggregate global settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion (approximately $22.3 billion). A significant determinative factor in the analysis of impairment indicators was the issue of allocation of CAD 32.5 billion aggregate settlement amount among RBH, ITL, and JTIM which remained unresolved at the time of filing.  On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Item 8, Note 18. \nContingencies\n). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion among RBH, ITL, and JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI’s investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in RBH was lower than its carrying value.  As a result, PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million (representing a diluted EPS charge of $1.49 per share) in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 6. \nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other\n. \nIncome taxes –\n The Income tax impact associated with Swedish Match AB financing that increased our 2023 diluted EPS by $0.11 per share and decreased our 2024 diluted EPS by $0.14 per share in the table above was due to a deferred tax impact for unrealized foreign currency gains and losses on intercompany loans related to the Swedish Match acquisition financing reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings, while the underlying pre-tax foreign currency movements fully offset in the consolidated statements of earnings and were reflected as currency translation adjustments in the consolidated statements of stockholders' (deficit) equity. \nThe 2023 tax items that decreased our 2023 diluted EPS by $0.11 per share in the table above were due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to the unremitted earnings of PMI's Russian subsidiaries due to the unilateral suspension of certain Russian double tax treaties by the Russian authorities on August 8, 2023, with respect to certain payments including dividends. The 2024 tax items that increased our 2024 diluted EPS by $0.03 per share in the table above were due to a U.S. tax benefit for a worthless stock deduction under section 165(g) of the Internal Revenue Code related to PMI’s investment in C.A. Tabacalera Nacional, a wholly owned foreign corporation incorporated in Venezuela. \nThe change in the tax rate that decreased our diluted EPS by $0.07 per share in the table above was primarily due to increases in U.S. state tax expense, repatriation cost differences, and changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction.\n31\nCurrency \n– The unfavorable impact of $0.38 per share during the reporting period primarily results from the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, especially against the Egyptian pound, Euro, Japanese yen and Russian ruble. This unfavorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases.  \n \nInterest\n – The unfavorable impact of $0.03 per share from interest in the table above was due primarily to higher average debt levels and higher average interest rates on debt, partially offset by higher interest income.\nOperations\n – The increase in diluted EPS of $1.04 per share from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments:   \n•\nSSEA, CIS & MEA: Favorable pricing and favorable volume/mix, partly offset by higher manufacturing costs and higher marketing, administration and research costs; \n•\nEurope: Favorable pricing and favorable volume/mix, partly offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs; \n•\nEA, AU & PMI DF: Favorable pricing, favorable volume/mix and lower manufacturing costs, partly offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs; and \n•\nAmericas: Favorable volume/mix and favorable pricing, partly offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs. \nFor further details, see the \nConsolidated Operating Results\n and \nOperating Results by Business Segment\n sections of the following \nDiscussion and Analysis\n. \nDiscussion and Analysis   \nCritical Accounting Estimates",
