Our principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (“SSDs”) and storage subsystems and offer storage solutions such as a scalable edge-to-cloud mass data platform that includes data transfer shuttles and a storage-as-a-service cloud.\nHDDs are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. HDDs continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, reliability, high capacities, superior quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing HDD storage architectures, SSDs use NAND flash memory integrated circuit assemblies to store data. \n3\nTable of Contents\nOur HDD products are designed for mass capacity storage in the cloud and at the edge as well as legacy market applications. Mass capacity storage involves well-established use cases, such as hyperscale data centers and private and public clouds as well as quickly emerging use cases such as machine learning (“ML”) and artificial intelligence (“AI”). Legacy markets are those that we continue to sell to but we do not plan to invest in significantly. Our HDD and SSD product portfolio includes Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (“SATA”), Serial Attached SCSI (“SAS”) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (“NVMe”) based designs to support a wide variety of mass capacity and legacy applications. \nOur systems portfolio includes storage subsystems for enterprises, cloud service providers (“CSPs”), scale-out storage servers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). Engineered for modularity, mobility, capacity and performance, these solutions are built with our enterprise HDDs and SSDs, enabling customers to integrate powerful, scalable storage within existing environments or create new ecosystems from the ground up in a secure, cost-effective manner.\nOur Lyve portfolio provides a simple, cost-efficient and secure way to manage massive volumes of data across the distributed enterprise. The Lyve platform includes a shuttle solution that enables enterprises to transfer massive amounts of data from endpoints to the core cloud and a storage-as-a-service cloud offering that provides frictionless mass capacity storage at the metro edge.\nIndustry Overview \nData Storage Industry\n \nThe data storage industry includes companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for data storage devices, as well as providers of storage solutions, software and services. These providers address data storage needs for cloud, enterprise and other edge markets. The rapid growth of data generation, the intelligent application of data and the rise in data value are driving demand for data storage. As more data is created at endpoints outside traditional data centers, the need for real-time decision making we expect will drive an increase in processing at the edge and in the cloud. Additionally, the need for data storage and management between the edge and cloud continues to increase. Use cases include connected and autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing, smart cities and emerging generative AI (“Gen AI”) applications. We believe the proliferation and creation of media-rich digital content, further enabled by Gen AI, ML, fifth-generation wireless (“5G”) technology, the edge and the Internet of Things (“IoT”) will continue to create demand for higher capacity storage solutions. The resulting mass data ecosystem is expected to require increasing amounts of data storage at the edge, in the cloud and in between. \nMarkets \nThe principal data storage markets include:\nMass Capacity Storage Markets\nMass capacity storage supports scalable, high capacity, cost efficient storage applications, including nearline cloud, nearline enterprise, video and image applications (“VIA”) and \nnetwork-attached storage (“\nNAS”) and edge-to-cloud data storage infrastructures. \nNearline.\n \nNearline applications require mass capacity devices and mass capacity subsystems that provide end-to-end solutions to businesses for the purpose of modular and scalable storage. Cloud and enterprise storage applications require both high-capacity and energy efficient storage devices to support low total cost of ownership. Seagate systems offer mass capacity storage solutions that provide foundational infrastructure for private and public clouds. The nearline market includes storage for cloud computing, content delivery, archival, backup services and emerging use cases such as generative AI.\nVIA and NAS. VIA and NAS drives are specifically designed to ensure the appropriate performance and reliability of the system for video analytics and camera enabled environments or network storage environments. These markets include storage for security and smart video installations.\nEdge-to-cloud data storage infrastructures, transport, and activation of mass data. The Seagate Lyve portfolio grew out of our mass capacity storage portfolio. It provides a simple, cost-efficient and secure way to manage, transport and activate massive volumes of data across the distributed enterprise. Among other elements, the Lyve portfolio includes a shuttle solution that enables enterprises to transfer vast amounts of data from endpoints to the core cloud and a storage-as-a-service cloud that provides frictionless mass capacity storage at the metro edge. \nLegacy Markets\nLegacy markets include consumer, client and mission critical applications. We continue to sell to these markets but do not plan significant additional investment.\nConsumer storage. Consumer applications are externally connected storage, both HDD and SSD-based, used to provide backup capabilities, augmented storage capacity, or portable storage for PCs, mobile devices and gaming consoles.\n4\nTable of Contents\nClient storage. Client applications include desktop and notebook storage that rely on low cost-per-HDD and SSD devices to provide built-in storage, digital video recorder (“DVR”) storage for video streaming in always-on consumer premise equipment and media center, and gaming storage for PC-based gaming systems as well as console gaming applications including both internal and external storage options.\nMission critical storage. Mission critical applications are defined as those that use very high-performance enterprise class HDDs and SSDs with sophisticated firmware to reliably support very high workloads.\nParticipants in the data storage industry include:\nMajor subcomponent manufacturers. \nCompanies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in data storage devices or solutions include companies that supply spindle motors, heads and media, and application specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”).\nStorage device manufacturers. \nCompanies that transform components into storage products include disk drive manufacturers and semiconductor storage manufacturers that integrate flash memory into storage products such as SSDs.\nStorage solutions manufacturers and system integrators. \nCompanies, such as Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), that bundle and package storage solutions, distributors that integrate storage hardware and software into end-user applications, CSPs that provide cloud based solutions to businesses for the purpose of scale-out storage solutions and modular systems, and producers of solutions such as storage racks.\nCloud and hyperscale data centers. \nLarge cloud and hyperscale data center companies, many of which are CSPs, are increasingly designing their own storage subsystems and having them built by contract manufacturers for their own data centers. The leading hyperscale data center companies are also implementing advanced AI technologies to enhance their business growth. To support this AI-driven expansion, they are increasing the storage capacity of both AI-specific and traditional cloud infrastructure.\nStorage services. \nCompanies that provide and host services and solutions, which include storage, backup, archiving, recovery and discovery of data.\nDemand for Data Storage \nIn the “Worldwide Global DataSphere Forecast, 2025-2029”, published by the International Data Corporation\n1\n (“IDC”), the global datasphere is forecasted to grow at a compound rate of 25% over the next five years to reach 527 zettabytes annually by 2029. Digital transformation has given rise to many new applications, all of which rely on faster access to and secure storage of data proliferating from endpoints through edge to cloud. Additionally, the adoption of generative AI applications is expected to accelerate the creation of digital content such as text, images and video over the long term. We expect these trends will have a positive impact on storage demand.\nAs more applications require real-time decision making, some data processing and storage are moving closer to the network edge. We believe this will result in a buildup of private and edge cloud environments that will enable fast and secure access to data throughout the IoT ecosystem. \nFactors contributing to the growth of digital content include:\n•\nCreation, sharing and consumption of media-rich content, such as high-resolution photos, high-definition videos and digital music through smart phones, tablets, digital cameras, personal video cameras, DVRs, gaming consoles or other digital devices; the adoption of smart home and wearable devices as well as the growth of social media platforms; \n•\nRapid consumer and enterprise adoption of widely available generative AI tools;\n•\nIncreasing use of video and imaging sensors to collect and analyze data used to improve traffic flow, emergency response times and manufacturing production costs, as well as for new security surveillance systems that feature higher resolution digital cameras and thus require larger data storage capacities; \n•\nCreation and collection of data through the development and evolution of the IoT ecosystem, big data analytics, machine learning and new technology trends such as autonomous vehicles and drones, smart manufacturing, and smart cities, as well as emerging trends including generative AI content growth or applications that converge the digital and physical worlds such as the metaverse or use of digital twins;\n•\nThe growing use of analytics, especially for action on data created at the edge instead of processing and analyzing at the data center, which is particularly important for verticals such as autonomous vehicles, property monitoring systems, and smart manufacturing;\n1\n \nWorldwide IDC Global DataSphere Forecast, 2025–2029,\n \nDoc #US53363625, May 2025.\n5\nTable of Contents\n•\nCloud migration initiatives and the ongoing advancement of the cloud, including the build out of large numbers of cloud data centers by CSPs and private companies transitioning on-site data centers into the cloud; and   \n•\nThe need for protection of increased digital content through redundant storage on backup devices and externally provided storage services is essential.\nAs a result of these factors, we anticipate that the nature and volume of data being created will require greater storage capability, which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity mass storage solutions. \nIn addition, the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving. The utilization of private and public cloud storage and open-source solutions is reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices. Accordingly, we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for data storage products and solutions going forward.\nDemand Trends \nWe believe that continued growth in digital content creation will require increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store, aggregate, host, distribute, analyze, manage, protect, back up and use such content. We also believe that as architectures evolve to serve a growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world, storage solutions will evolve as well. \nMass capacity storage is and will continue to be the enabler of scale. According to IDC’s 2025 Cloud Infrastructure Index, hard drives store 87% of exabytes in large data center deployments. We expect increased data creation will lead to the expansion of the need for storage in the form of HDDs, SSDs and systems. While the advance of solid state technology in many end markets is expected to increase, we believe that in the foreseeable future, cloud, edge and traditional enterprise that require high-capacity storage solutions will be best served by HDDs due to their ability to deliver reliable, scalable, energy-efficient and the most cost-effective mass storage devices. As HDD capacities continue to increase, demand for higher capacity drives is expected to grow due to their better total cost of ownership compared with lower capacity drives. As a result, we can address higher exabyte demand with fewer HDD units that have higher average capacity per drive.\nIndustry Supply Balance \nFrom time to time, the storage industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand. To the extent that the storage industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize, price erosion may become more pronounced. Conversely, during periods where demand exceeds supply, we usually have better pricing power and price erosion is generally muted. As production lead-times for our latest generation of high-capacity HDDs have extended, we began to require longer term demand forecasts and commitments from customers to improve supply predictability and create greater alignment between supply and demand. \nOur Business\nData Storage Technologies \nThe design and manufacturing of HDDs depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques. Therefore, it requires relatively high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments. We design, fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components in our disk drives, including read/write heads and recording media. Our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets. Our core technology platforms focus on the areal density of media and read/write head technologies, including the Mozaic platform, which is the industry’s first implementation of the high-capacity enabling heat-assisted magnetic recording (“HAMR”) technology as well as innovations like shingled-magnetic-recording (\"SMR\") technology, and the throughput-optimizing multi actuator MACH.2 technology. This design and manufacturing approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of storage products to service a wide range of data storage applications and industries. \nDisk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics: \n•\nInput/output operations per second (“IOPS”), commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the maximum number of reads and writes to a storage location; \n•\nStorage capacity, commonly expressed in TB, which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk drive;\n•\nAreal density, which is a measurement of the storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk (also known as platter);\n6\nTable of Contents\n•\nSpindle rotation speed, commonly expressed in revolutions per minute (“RPM”), which has an effect on speed of access to data;\n•\nInterface transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller;\n•\nAverage seek time, commonly expressed in milliseconds, which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface;\n•\nData transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk drive; \n•\nProduct quality and reliability, commonly expressed in annualized return rates; and\n•\nEnergy efficiency, commonly measured by the power output such as energy per TB necessary to operate the disk drive. \nThe total storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the size and number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks. \nWe also offer SSDs as part of our storage solutions portfolio. Our portfolio includes devices with SATA, SAS and NVMe interfaces. The SSDs differ from HDDs in that they are without mechanical parts. \nSSDs store data on NAND flash memory cells, or metal-oxide semiconductor transistors using a charge on a capacitor to represent a binary digit. SSD technology offers fast access to data and robust performance. SSDs complement hyperscale applications, high-density data centers, cloud environments and web servers. They are also used in mission-critical enterprise applications, consumer, gaming and NAS applications.\nManufacturing\nWe primarily design and manufacture our own read/write heads and recording media, which are critical technologies for disk drives. This integrated approach enables us to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently.\nWe believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy, we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities to leverage the close interdependence of components for disk drives. Our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy. We continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing costs by: \n•\nEmploying manufacturing automation;\n•\nEmploying machine learning algorithms and AI; \n•\nImproving product quality and reliability;\n•\nIntegrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements;\n•\nCoordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing; and \n•\nOperating our facilities at optimal capacities.\nA vertically integrated model, however, tends to have less flexibility when demand declines as it exposes us to higher unit costs when capacity utilization is not optimized which would lead to factory underutilization charges as we experienced in fiscal years 2024 and 2023.\nComponents and Raw Materials\nDisk drives incorporate certain components, including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly, which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination-controlled environment. We maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products, such as read/write heads and recording media.\n7\nTable of Contents\nRead/Write Heads. \nThe function of the read/write head is to scan across the disk as it spins, magnetically recording or reading information. The tolerances of read/write heads are extremely demanding and require state-of-the-art equipment and processes. Our read/write heads are manufactured with thin-film and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits, though challenges related to magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry. In addition, HAMR technology utilizes a laser and a near-field transducer on the read/write head to heat an extremely small spot on the magnetic disk, allowing for higher data density storage. We perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of read/write heads at our facilities. We use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced read/write heads, the mix of which varies based on product mix, technology and our internal capacity levels.\nMedia. \nData is written to or read from the media, or disk, as it rotates at very high speeds past the read/write head. The media is made from non-magnetic substrates, usually an aluminum alloy or glass and is coated with thin layers of magnetic materials. HAMR technology requires media with higher coercivity alloys that are stable at room temperature. The laser temporarily lowers the coercivity allowing data to be written. We use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates, the mix of which varies based on product mix, technology and our internal capacity levels. We purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties.\nPrinted Circuit Board Assemblies. \nThe printed circuit board assemblies (“PCBAs”) are comprised of standard and custom ASICs and ancillary electronic control chips. The ASICs control the movement of data to and from the read/write heads and through the internal controller and interface, which communicates with the host computer. The ASICs and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved. Disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as SATA, SCSI, or SAS to communicate to the host systems. \nHead Disk Assembly. \nThe head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub. Read/write heads, mounted on an arm assembly, similar in concept to that of a record player, fly extremely close to each disk surface, and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks. The read/write heads are mounted vertically on an E-shaped assembly (“E-block”) that is actuated by a voice-coil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track. The E-block and recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly. We purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products. \nDisk Drive Assembly.\n Following the completion of the head disk assembly, it is mated to the PCBA, and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and machine learning prior to packaging and shipment. Disk drive assembly and machine learning operations occur primarily at our facilities located in China and Thailand. We perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in China, Malaysia, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Thailand and the United States.\nContract Manufacturing. \nWe outsource the manufacturing and assembly of certain components and products to third parties in various countries worldwide. This includes outsourcing the PCBAs used in our disk drives, SSDs and storage subsystems. We continue to participate in the design of our components and products, and we are directly involved in qualifying key suppliers and components used in our products.\nSuppliers of Components and Industry Constraints.\n There are a limited number of independent suppliers of components, such as recording heads and media, available to disk drive manufacturers. From time to time, we may enter into long-term supply arrangements with these independent suppliers. Vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers like us, who manufacture their own components, are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers. However, certain parts of our business have been adversely affected by our suppliers’ capacity constraints and this could occur again in the future.\nCommodity and Other Manufacturing Costs.\n The production of disk drives requires rare earth elements, precious metals, scarce alloys and industrial commodities, which are subject to fluctuations in price and the supply of which has at times been constrained. In addition to increased costs of components and commodities, volatility in fuel and other transportation costs may also increase our costs related to commodities, manufacturing and freight. As a result, we may increase our use of alternative shipment methods to help offset any increase in freight costs, and we will continually review various forms of shipments and routes to minimize the exposure to higher freight costs. \nProducts \nWe offer a broad range of storage solutions for mass capacity storage and legacy applications. We differentiate products on the basis of capacity, performance, product quality, reliability, price, form factor, interface, power consumption efficiency, security features and other customer integration requirements.

Lyve Cloud Object Storage is a consumption-based, mass storage simple storage service (“S3”) compatible cloud, completing our comprehensive edge-to-cloud portfolio. Lyve Cloud is available in standard and infrequent access tiers, across multiple geographic regions.\nCustomers\nWe sell our products to major OEMs, distributors and retailers. \n9\nTable of Contents\nOEM customers, including large hyperscale data center companies and CSPs, typically enter into master purchase agreements with us. Deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders. Historically, customers could defer or cancel most purchase orders without significant penalty. However, during fiscal year 2024, as production lead-times extended for our latest generation of high-capacity hard disk drives, we began to require longer term demand forecasts and commitments, with potential cancellation charges across key global OEM customers which was necessary to improve supply predictability and align supply with customer demand requirements. While not entirely eliminating order deferments or cancellations from our key OEM customers, we expect these changes will dampen demand volatility over time.\nOur distributors generally enter into non-exclusive agreements for the resale of our products. They typically furnish us with a non-binding indication of their near-term requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly. The agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited rights of return and price protection. In addition, we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel.\nOur retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors. Retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support, sales incentives and price protection periods.\nSee “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 16. Revenue\n” contained in this report for a description of our major customers.\nCompetition\n \nWe compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the mass capacity storage and legacy markets, and with other companies in the data storage industry that provide SSDs and systems. Some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity, product performance, product quality and reliability, price per unit and price per TB, storage/retrieval access times, data transfer rates, form factor, product warranty and support capabilities, supply continuity and flexibility, power consumption, total cost of ownership and brand. While different markets and customers place varying levels of emphasis on these factors, we believe that our products are competitive with respect to many of these factors in the markets that we currently compete in.\nPrincipal Competitors. \nWe compete with manufacturers of storage solutions and the other principal manufacturers in the data storage solution industry including:\n•\nKioxia Holdings Corporation; \n•\nMicron Technology, Inc.; \n•\nSamsung Electronics; \n•\nSandisk Corporation;\n•\nSK hynix, Inc.; \n•\nToshiba Corporation; and \n•\nWestern Digital Corporation.\nPrice Erosion. \nHistorically, our industry has been characterized by price declines for data storage products with comparable\n \ncapacity, performance and feature sets (“like-for-like products”). Price declines for like-for-like products (“price erosion”) tend to be more pronounced during periods of: \n•\nEconomic contraction in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share; \n•\nFew new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings; and \n•\nIndustry supply exceeding demand. \nData storage manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of data storage products characterized by higher capacity, better performance and additional feature sets and product cost reductions.\nWe believe our HDDs’ supply and demand remained well balanced during fiscal year 2025, supporting a healthy pricing environment. \n10\nTable of Contents\nProduct Life Cycles and Changing Technology. \nSuccess in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with time-to-volume, performance, capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price, level of service and support that our customers expect. Generally, the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix, favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced. Evolving technology also necessitates on-going investments in research and development, which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles or economic declines. Further, there is a continuing need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions, as factors such as quality, reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance.\nCyclicality and Seasonality\n \nOur mass capacity markets are subject to variability of sales, which can be attributed to the timing of IT spending or a reflection of cyclical demand from CSPs based on the timing of their procurement and deployment requirements and their ability to procure other components needed to build out data center infrastructure. Our legacy markets, such as consumer storage applications, traditionally experienced seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the first half of the fiscal year, primarily driven by consumer spending related to back-to-school season and traditional holiday shopping season. \nResearch and Development\nOur Research & Development (R&D) organization is focused on the development of storage solutions leveraging our areal density leadership in mass capacity hard disk drives. Our portfolio also includes solid state drives and systems. We continue to develop innovative magnetic recording technologies as well as conduct research on adjacent technologies necessary for the development of scalable, high-availability storage products. \nSeagate’s HAMR based Mozaic platform reflects our ability to productize complex nanoscale technologies, create a foundation for scaling to increasingly higher capacity hard drive storage products, and extend our areal density leadership. In addition, we continue to optimize our perpendicular magnetic recording (“PMR”) product development and manufacturing by leveraging design systems that extend across product generations and result in more efficient resource utilization.\nOur wafer and media development, recording subsystems, firmware, and system development happens around the world. Our primary R&D centers are located in Northern Ireland, Singapore, Thailand and in the U.S. in California, Colorado and Minnesota. \nThe expenses related to R&D depend on several factors including the stage of technological development and product qualification timelines. \nPatents and Licenses\nAs of June 27, 2025, we had approximatel\ny 3,273 U\n.S. patents and 243 patents issued in various non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as approximately 221 U.S. and 38 non-U.S. patent applications pending. The number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity. Due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the data storage industry, we believe that, in addition to patent protection, the improvement of existing products, reliance upon trade secrets, protection of unpatented proprietary know-how and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Accordingly, we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property, including obtaining patents, where available, in connection with our research and development program.\nThe data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation arising from time to time relating to patent and other intellectual property rights. Occasionally, we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties. Although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims without a material adverse effect on us, other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements. In addition, other claims are pending, which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For more information on these claims, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 13.\n \nLegal, Environmental and Other Contingencies\n.” The costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been, and in the future may be, substantial, irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome.\n11\nTable of Contents\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to \nU.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities\n. \nWe have established\n an environmental management system and continually review and update our environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide as needed. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits. We budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws. If additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures\n.\nSome environmental laws, such as the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the “Superfund” law) and its state equivalents, \ncan impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators, or upon parties who sent waste to these sites, regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity. We have been identified as a responsible or potentially responsible party at several sites. At each of these sites, we have an assigned portion of the financial exposure based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties. We have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few at this time. Based on our current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs, we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material\n.\nWe may be subject to \nvarious state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products. For example, the European Union (“EU”) enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (2011/65/EU), which prohibits the use of certain substances, including lead, in certain products, including disk drives and server storage products\n, put on the market after July 1, 2006. \nSimilar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, Taiwan, the U.S. and others. The EU REACH Directive (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals, EC 1907/2006) also restricts substances of very high concern in products. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with the substance restrictions, recycle content requirements or other environmental requirements as they are enacted worldwide, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business\n.\nSocial and Employee Matters\nAs of June 27, 2025, \nwe employed approximately 30,000 full-time employees worldwide, of which approximately 25,000 were located in Asia. We\n believe that our employees are crucial to our current success and that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract, retain and further motivate qualified employees at all levels. We believe that our employee relations are good.\nCulture of Inclusion. \nWe thrive as a global workforce by leveraging our collective strengths and experiences to develop and deliver our business strategy. One of the ways we foster a culture of belonging and inclusion is through our support of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). These voluntary, employee-led communities are built around shared experiences and offer numerous benefits, including fostering workplace connections and enhancing a sense of belonging.\nOur ERGs are open to all employees, representing a wide range of backgrounds and focus on leadership topics, networking, and community outreach. There are 32 ERG chapters across seven countries, all led by employees and supported by Seagate leaders. Through these ongoing efforts, our primary goal is to ensure every employee feels safe, respected, and welcomed. \nWe also celebrate our culture of belonging and inclusion by recognizing cultural and heritage months across our global locations. Events such as Lunar New Year, Veterans Day, and International Women’s Day are marked with activities like educational panels, cultural recipe sharing, employee interviews, and other community-relevant celebrations.\nHealth & Safety. \nAll our manufacturing sites have health and safety management systems certified to the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 45001 standard. In addition, we are audited to health and safety standards set forth by the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”). Our global health and safety standards, as well as our accompanying Environment, Health and Safety (“EHS”) management systems, frequently go beyond country or industry-level guidelines to ensure that we keep our employees healthy and safe. We regularly host health and safety regulatory visits that focus on issues such as safety, radiation, fire codes, food and transportation. Through our EHS management systems, we ensure that the focus remains on the continuous improvement of employee health and safety programs. We continue to provide comprehensive health and safety training to our employees. We emphasize e-learning courses as our main vehicle for delivering such training because employees can learn at their own pace. \n12\nTable of Contents\nDevelopment, Retention, Compensation, Benefits & Engagement. \nOur performance management system is a continuous process that helps team members focus on the right priorities. Meaningful conversations between managers and employees are the foundation of performance management at Seagate. We focus on dialogue centered around manager and employee conversations, and ongoing feedback, to align goals. This approach focuses on achieving high-quality productive dialogue between managers and employees. We also encourage our employees to participate in the many learning opportunities available at Seagate. The portfolio of learning and training opportunities includes but is not limited to mentoring and coaching, e-learning opportunities, self-paced training, on-the-job training and other strategic internal programs that cover topics ranging from leadership and technical skills to health, safety and the environment. For example, our internal mobility and career development tool provides Seagate employees with the opportunity to establish networking and mentorship connections, identify and participate in internal part-time projects, and explore internal full-time positions.\nOur Total Rewards program is designed to attract, motivate and retain talented people to meet our business goals. The program generally includes base pay, annual bonuses, commissions, equity awards, an employee share purchasing plan, retirement savings opportunities and other employee health and wellness benefits. Our compensation programs and guidelines are structured to align pay with both company and employee performance and aim to provide internally and externally competitive total compensation.\nEmployee engagement is the psychological commitment and passion that drives discretionary effort. It predicts individual performance and is the measure of the relationship between employees and the Company. Our engagement survey includes facets of the employee experience throughout the employee life cycle. Employee experience is what employees encounter and observe during their career at Seagate. A positive employee experience can have an impact on everything from recruiting to Seagate's bottom line. \nIn fiscal year 2025\n, we conducted our Employee Experience Survey to obtain feedback from our global workforce on their experience at Seagate. Managers \nwere provided access to a dashboard with results that shared key drivers of employee engagement specific to their own organizations for action planning. We conducted several additional surveys across Seagate’s global footprint, which were followed by employee and leader connection sessions at the regional and site levels, for the continuous improvement of internal communications and business planning. \nCommunity Impact.\n Our community engagement program is designed to provide support to our local communities, with an emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (“STEM”). This year to support STEM, we organized Take Our Children to Work Day at eight of our largest sites. More than 330 children visited and engaged in educational activities including hard drive assembly, AI design workshops, and electromagnetic experiments. We also continued to promote sustainability and environmental programs including Earth Day in April. Employees around the world participated in environmentally friendly activities, including litter cleanups and tree planting. Employees in Singapore maintain a rooftop garden where the food produced is donated to a local home for the elderly, a great example of sustaining a partnership between employee volunteers and a community need. We continued supporting various food banks, blood drives, and other non-profit organizations including Habitat for Humanity in Minnesota where employees spent 11 days building homes for those in need.\nOur community engagement program prioritizes local relationships to strengthen ties within the communities we work and live in. By collaborating with various local organizations, participating in community-driven initiatives, and addressing specific needs near our locations, we aim to create a more sustainable and positive impact that resonates both now and in the future.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Performance Report\nAdditional information regarding our ESG commitment and progress can be found on the ESG section of our website and in our ESG Performance Report.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024. Discussions of year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2024 and 2023 are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on August 2, 2024.\nYou should read this discussion in conjunction with “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as noted, references to any fiscal year mean the twelve-month period ending on the Friday closest to June 30 of that year. Accordingly, fiscal year 2025 and 2024 both comprised of 52 weeks and ended on June 27, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. \nFiscal year 2026 will be comprised of 53 weeks and will end on July 3, 2026. \nOur Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is provided in addition to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our MD&A is organized as follows:\n•\nOverview of Fiscal Year 2025.\n Highlights of events in fiscal year 2025 that impacted our financial position.\n•\nResults of Operations. \nAnalysis of our financial results comparing fiscal years 2025 and 2024. \n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\n Analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows and discussion of our financial condition, including potential sources of liquidity, material cash requirements and their general purpose.\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\n Accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.\n39\nTable of Contents\nFor an overview of our business, see “Part I, Item 1. Business.”\nOverview of Fiscal Year 2025 \nDuring fiscal year 2025, we shipped 595 exabytes of HDD storage capacity. We generated revenue of approximately $9.1 billion with a gross margin of 35% and net income of $1.5 billion. Our operating cash flow was $1.1 billion\n and we paid \n$600 million \nin dividends. We issued \n$400 million\n principal amount of senior notes, repaid $479 million principal amount of the 2025 Notes and $505 million of the 2027 Notes, as well as repurchased $99 million principal amount of certain senior notes. Additionally, we acquired Intevac, Inc. (“Intevac”), a supplier of thin-film processing systems, for a net cash outlay of $47 million.\nRecent Developments, Economic Conditions and Challenges\nDuring fiscal year 2025, \nwe experienced a significant increase in demand for our high capacity nearline drives primarily from cloud customers. At the same time, we have continued to operate in a dynamic macroeconomic environment marked by rapid shifts in trade policies and increasing geopolitical tensions. These factors may impact our business and results of operations. We will continue to monitor the situation and assess plans to mitigate future risk to the business. Over the long-term we expect our hard drive storage business to benefit from future growth in data demand and data value, including from the adoption of Generative AI applications.\nFor a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks, see “Part I, Item 1A.

Our parent holding company owns various U.S. and non-Singaporean subsidiaries that operate in multiple non-Singaporean income tax jurisdictions. Our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of income tax or is exempt from income tax due to tax incentive programs we operate under in Singapore and Thailand\n. \nOur income tax provision recorded for fiscal years \n2025\n differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the Singaporean statutory rate of 17% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax incentive programs and (ii) changes in valuation allowance. \n43\nTable of Contents\nOur income tax provision recorded for fiscal years 2024 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the Singaporean statutory rate of 17% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) changes in valuation allowance and (ii) current year generation of research credits. \nOn July 4, 2025 the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted in the U.S. The OBBBA includes significant provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, modifications to the international tax framework, and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in fiscal year 2026 and others implemented through fiscal year 2028. We are currently assessing its impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nThe following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements, as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital resources. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. The principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible. We operate in some countries that have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash and/or foreign exchange across their borders. However, we believe our sources of cash will continue to be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months. Although there can be no assurance, we believe that our financial resources, along with controlling our costs and capital expenditures, will allow us to manage the ongoing impact of market demand disruptions on our business operations for the foreseeable future. However, some challenges to our industry and to our business continue to remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Consequently, we will continue to evaluate our financial position in light of future developments, particularly those relating to the global economic factors.\nWe are not aware of any downgrades, losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents from the values reported as of June 27, 2025. For additional information on risks and factors that could impact our ability to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements among others, see “Part I, Item 1A.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 4. Debt\n” for more details).\n45\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 27, 2025, no borrowings (including swing line loans) were outstanding and no commitments were utilized for letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is available for borrowings, subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing.\nAs of June 27, 2025, the New Credit Agreement includes one financial covenant, net leverage ratio. We continue to evaluate our debt portfolio and structure to comply with our financial debt covenants. As of June 27, 2025, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements. Refer to “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements—\nNote 4. Debt\n” for more details.\nWe believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to fund liquidity requirements beyond 12 months will depend on our future cash flows, which are determined by future operating performance, and therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. \nFor additional information on risks and factors that could impact our ability to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements, among others, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.\nCash Requirements and Commitments\nOur liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital, product development and capital expenditure needs, to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and to fund our quarterly dividend and any future strategic investments. \nPurchase obligations\n \nPurchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services, which are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specify all significant terms. From time to time, we enter into long-term, non-cancelable purchase commitments or make large up-front investments with certain suppliers in order to secure certain components or technologies for the production of our products or to supplement our internal manufacturing capacity for certain components. As of June 27, 2025, we had unconditional purchase obligations of app\nroximately $1.3 billion, primarily related to purchases of inventory components with our suppliers. We expect\n \n$1.2 billion\n \nof these co\nmmitments to be paid within one year. In addition, we also had certain long-term market share based non-cancellable inventory purchase commitments as of June 27, 2025. \nCapital expenditures\nWe incur material capital expenditures to design and manufacture our products that depend on advanced technologies and manufacturing techniques. As of June 27, 2025, we had unconditional commitments of \n$151 million\n primarily related to purchases of equipment, of which approximately \n$105 million\n is expected to be paid within one y\near. For fiscal year 2026, we expect capital expenditures to be higher than fiscal year 2025.\nOperating leases\nWe are a lessee in several operating leases related to real estate facilities for warehouse, office and lab space. As of June 27, 2025, the amount of future minimum rent expense for both occupied and vacated facilities under non-cancelable operating lease contracts was $516 million, of which $64 million is expected to be paid within one year. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 6. Leases\n” for details.\nLong-term debt and interest payments on debt\nAs of June 27, 2025, the future principal payment obligation on our long-term debt was $5.0 billion, which will mature in more than one year. As of June 27, 2025, future interest payments on this outstanding debt is estimated to be approximately $1.8 billion, of which $313 million is expected to be paid within one year. Subsequent to our Consolidated Balance Sheet date, on June 30, 2025, the conditional conversion feature of the 2028 Notes was triggered in accordance with the terms of the 2028 Notes indenture. Accordingly, the 2028 Notes are exchangeable through September 30, 2025. From time to time, we may repurchase, redeem or otherwise extinguish any of our outstanding senior notes in open market or privately negotiated purchases or o\ntherwise, or we may repurchase or redeem outstanding senior notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture.\n Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 4. Debt\n” for more details.\nBIS settlement penalty\nWe accrued a settlement penalty of $300 million for fiscal year 2023, related to BIS’ allegations of violations of the U.S. EAR, which were subsequently resolved by the Settlement Agreement in April 2023. As part of the Settlement Agreement with BIS, quarterly payments of $15 million are made over the course of five years beginning October 31, 2023, of which $60 million is expected to be paid within one year and $135 million thereafter. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 13. Legal, Environmental and Other Contingencies\n” for more details.\n46\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 27, 2025, we made cash payments of $14 million, primarily related to workforce reduction costs under our restructuring plans.\nAs of June 27, 2025, the future cash payments related to our remaining active restructuring plans were immaterial.\nIncome Tax\nAs of June 27, 2025, we had an immaterial liability for unrecognized tax benefits, none of which is expected to be settled within one year. Outside of one year, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur.\n \nDividends\nOn July 29, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.72 per share, which will be payable on October 9, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2025. Our ability to pay dividends in the future will be subject to, among other things, general business conditions within the data storage industry, our financial results, the impact of paying dividends on our credit ratings and legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us or by us to our ordinary shareholders, including restrictions imposed by covenants on our debt instruments.\nShare repurchases\nFrom\n time to time, at our discretion, we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through private, open market, or broker assisted purchases, tender offers, or other means, including through the use of derivative transactions. During fiscal year 2025, we repurchased approximately 1 million of our ordinary shares including shares withheld for statutory tax withholdings related to vesting of employee equity awards. See “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Repurchases of Our Equity Securities.” As of June 27, 2025, \n$5.0 billion\n remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit. We may limit or terminate the repurchase program at any time. All repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with our Constitution.\nWe require substantial amounts of cash to fund any increased working capital requirements, future capital expenditures, scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and payments of dividends. We will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations, including evaluating the issuance of new debt securities, exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions, open market purchases, tender offers or other means or otherwise. In addition, we may selectively pursue strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures and investments, which may require additional capital.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n”. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include: Revenue - Sales Program Accruals and Income Taxes. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to warranty, valuation of inventories, assessing goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment, valuation of share-based payments and restructuring. We believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective, or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period. \nRevenue \n-\n Sales Program Accruals.\n We record estimated variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition as a reduction to revenue. Variable consideration generally consists of expected rebates to be provided in relation to sales incentive programs, such as price protection and volume incentives aimed at increasing customer demand. For OEM sales, rebates are typically established by estimating the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received based on an OEM customer's volume of purchases from us or other agreed upon rebate programs. For the distribution and retail channel, these sales incentive programs typically involve estimating the most likely amount of rebates based on historical price incentives, known future price trends, and channel inventory level. Total sales programs were 14% and 16% of gross revenue in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior periods were less than 1% of gross revenue in fiscal years 2025 and 2024. \nIncome Taxes.\n We mak\ne certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, recognition of income and deductions and \n47\nTable of Contents\ncalculation of specific tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for income tax and financial statement purposes, as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.\nThe deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. Each period, we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and, if necessary, adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments, and estimates. If our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly, our assessment of the need for, and the amount of, a valuation allowance may also change resulting in an additional tax provision or benefit.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Item 8.
