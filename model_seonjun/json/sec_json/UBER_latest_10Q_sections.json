MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should review the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of forward-looking statements and Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of ride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight industry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nIf, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nFor a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operating condition and cash flows, see the risk factor titled “-\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees\n” included in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n36\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions, except percentages)\n2024\n2025\n% Change\n% Change\n(Constant Currency \n(1)\n)\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers (“MAPCs”) \n(2)\n161 \n189 \n17 \n%\nTrips \n(2)\n2,868 \n3,512 \n22 \n%\nGross Bookings \n(2)\n$\n40,973 \n$\n49,740 \n21 \n%\n21 \n%\nRevenue\n$\n11,188 \n$\n13,467 \n20 \n%\n19 \n%\nIncome from operations\n$\n1,061 \n$\n1,113 \n5 \n%\nNet income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.\n$\n2,612 \n$\n6,626 \n154 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA \n(1)\n$\n1,690 \n$\n2,256 \n33 \n%\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024\n2025\n% Change\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n5,387 \n$\n7,216 \n34 \n%\nFree cash flow \n(1)\n$\n5,189 \n$\n6,955 \n34 \n%\n(1)\n See the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n(2)\n See the section titled “Certain Key Metrics” for more information.\nHighlights for the Third Quarter 2025\nIn the third quarter of 2025, our MAPCs were 189 million, growing 17% compared to the same period in 2024.\nOverall Gross Bookings increased to $49.7 billion in the third quarter of 2025, up 21% on a constant currency basis, compared to the same period in 2024. Mobility Gross Bookings grew 19% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis primarily due to an increase in Mobility Trip volumes. Delivery Gross Bookings grew 24% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in Delivery Trip volumes. Freight Gross Bookings remained flat year-over-year, on a constant currency basis.\nRevenue was $13.5 billion, up 20% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 21%. The increase in Gross Bookings was primarily driven by an increase in Mobility and Delivery Trip volumes.\nNet income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $6.6 billion, which includes: (i) a $4.9 billion benefit from the release of our Netherlands’ deferred tax assets valuation allowance and (ii) the favorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized gain on debt and equity securities, net of $1.5 billion primarily related to changes in the fair value of our equity securities, including: a $760 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, a $530 million unrealized gain on our Grab investment, and a $181 million net unrealized gain on our other investments.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $2.3 billion, up $566 million compared to the same period in 2024. Mobility Adjusted EBITDA was $2.0 billion, up $356 million compared to the same period in 2024. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA was $921 million, up $293 million compared to the same period in 2024. These increases were partially offset by an $82 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs, year-over-year.\nWe ended the quarter with $9.1 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We intend to redeem our $1.15 billion 2025 Convertible Notes pursuant to a scheduled redemption in December 2025. For additional information, see Note 4 – Long-Term Debt and Credit Arrangements in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded that we are an agent in these arrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal, grocery or other delivery service. In certain markets we are responsible for the Mobility or Delivery services (and in most markets we are responsible for the Freight services), and in these markets we present revenue from end-users and from Shippers on a gross basis, with the payments to Drivers and Carriers classified within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\n37\nWe would expect revenue to fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future based upon factors such as Trip volume, Driver supply, macroeconomic conditions, global travel activities and management pricing and promotional activities.\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition” as well as “Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition” and “Note 2 – Revenue” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and Note 9 – Segment Information and Geographic Information in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are primarily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services, certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportation services, credit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, and amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses.\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future primarily driven by Trip volume changes on the platform.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\nWe would expect operations and support expenses to vary from period to period on an absolute dollar basis, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising costs, product marketing costs, consumer discounts, promotions, credits and refunds provided to end-users who are not customers, compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, and the allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.\nWe would expect sales and marketing expenses to vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and product development. Expenses also include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.\nWe would expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal-related accruals and expenses.\nWe would expect general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future as our business continues to grow and Trip volume increases, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to the variability of legal and regulatory-related expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes \n38\nexpenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, furniture and fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. For additional detail related to our debt obligations, see Note 4 – Long-Term Debt and Credit Arrangements in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:\n•\nInterest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investments.\n•\nForeign currency exchange gains (losses), net, which consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.\n•\nUnrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net, which consists primarily of gains (losses) from fair value adjustments relating to our marketable and non-marketable securities.\n•\nOther, net.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws.\nWe regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight of all available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. \nBased on all available positive and negative evidence, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against the California R&D credits, as we believe it is not more-likely-than-not to be realized, as we expect R&D tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use these credits in future periods.\nA significant portion of our historical valuation allowance was related to deferred tax assets in the Netherlands. Realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future pre-tax earnings. In evaluating the recoverability of these deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2025, we considered all available evidence, both positive and negative. \nAs of September 30, 2025, we are in a 12-quarter cumulative income position based on the Netherlands’ pre-tax book income adjusted for permanent book-to-tax differences. The 12-quarter cumulative income position is considered significant positive evidence that is both objective and verifiable. The historical income position provides us evidence to place greater reliance on projections of future profit as a source of income. Furthermore, current-year profitability and corresponding positive taxable income in the Netherlands, along with projections of future profit, provides strong positive evidence for the realization of our deferred tax assets in the Netherlands. \nBased on all available evidence, including the objective and verifiable positive evidence as described above and anticipated future earnings, we concluded it is more-likely-than-not that our Netherlands’ deferred tax assets will be realizable. Accordingly, we released $4.9 billion of our Netherlands valuation allowance during the quarter ended September 30, 2025. We will continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (\"CAMT\"), which is a minimum tax calculated by reference to financial statement income, does not apply to the Company in 2025. We could be subject to the CAMT in future years, which would require us to make minimum cash tax payments.\nIn addition, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has led international efforts among approximately 140 countries and taxing jurisdictions to propose and implement changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, including a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction. Under this guidance, we will be required to determine a combined effective tax rate for all entities located in a jurisdiction. If the jurisdictional effective tax rate determined under these rules is less than 15%, a top-up tax will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15%. We are continuing to monitor the pending implementation of these rules by individual countries and the potential impact on our business. We expect the provisions effective in 2025 to have an insignificant impact on our tax obligations for 2025.\n39\nFor additional information, see Note 7 – Income Taxes in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIncome (Loss) from Equity Method Investments\nIncome (loss) from equity method investments primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our equity method investments.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our condensed consolidated statements of operations for each of the periods presented (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\nRevenue\n$\n11,188 \n$\n13,467 \n$\n32,019 \n$\n37,651 \nCosts and expenses\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below \n6,761 \n8,109 \n19,417 \n22,657 \nOperations and support\n687 \n735 \n2,054 \n2,099 \nSales and marketing\n1,096 \n1,277 \n3,128 \n3,544 \nResearch and development\n774 \n862 \n2,324 \n2,517 \nGeneral and administrative\n630 \n1,183 \n2,525 \n2,509 \nDepreciation and amortization\n179 \n188 \n542 \n534 \nTotal costs and expenses\n10,127 \n12,354 \n29,990 \n33,860 \nIncome from operations\n1,061 \n1,113 \n2,029 \n3,791 \nInterest expense\n(143)\n(112)\n(406)\n(325)\nOther income (expense), net\n1,851 \n1,619 \n1,593 \n2,043 \nIncome before income taxes and loss from equity method investments\n2,769 \n2,620 \n3,216 \n5,509 \nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n158 \n(4,046)\n244 \n(4,306)\nLoss from equity method investments\n(12)\n(14)\n(28)\n(39)\nNet income including non-controlling interests\n2,599 \n6,652 \n2,944 \n9,776 \nLess: net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax\n(13)\n26 \n(29)\n19 \nNet income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.\n$\n2,612 \n$\n6,626 \n$\n2,973 \n$\n9,757 \nThe following table sets forth the components of our condensed consolidated statements of operations for each of the periods presented as a percentage of revenue \n(1)\n:\n40\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\nRevenue\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nCosts and expenses\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below\n60 \n%\n60 \n%\n61 \n%\n60 \n%\nOperations and support\n6 \n%\n5 \n%\n6 \n%\n6 \n%\nSales and marketing\n10 \n%\n9 \n%\n10 \n%\n9 \n%\nResearch and development\n7 \n%\n6 \n%\n7 \n%\n7 \n%\nGeneral and administrative\n6 \n%\n9 \n%\n8 \n%\n7 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n2 \n%\n1 \n%\n2 \n%\n1 \n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n91 \n%\n92 \n%\n94 \n%\n90 \n%\nIncome from operations\n9 \n%\n8 \n%\n6 \n%\n10 \n%\nInterest expense\n(1)\n%\n(1)\n%\n(1)\n%\n(1)\n%\nOther income (expense), net\n17 \n%\n12 \n%\n5 \n%\n5 \n%\nIncome before income taxes and loss from equity method investments\n25 \n%\n19 \n%\n10 \n%\n15 \n%\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n1 \n%\n(30)\n%\n1 \n%\n(11)\n%\nLoss from equity method investments\n— \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\nNet income including non-controlling interests\n23 \n%\n49 \n%\n9 \n%\n26 \n%\nLess: net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax\n— \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\nNet income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.\n23 \n%\n49 \n%\n9 \n%\n26 \n%\n(1)\n Totals of percentage of revenues may not foot due to rounding.\nThe following discussion and analysis is for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024.\nRevenue\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions, except percentages)\n2024\n2025\n% Change\n2024\n2025\n% Change\nRevenue\n$\n11,188 \n$\n13,467 \n20 \n%\n$\n32,019 \n$\n37,651 \n18 \n%\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared with the Same Period in 2024\nRevenue increased \n$2.3 billion\n, or 20%, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 21%.

Segment\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, Delivery revenue increased $1.0 billion, or 29%, and Delivery Adjusted EBITDA increased\n $293 million, or 47%.\nDelivery revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 25%, driven by an increase in Trip volumes, and a $146 million increase in advertising

Freight revenue was flat, and Freight Adjusted EBITDA \ndeclined\n \n$1 million\n, or \n5%\n.\nFreight revenue \nwas flat,\n primarily attributable to a challenging freight market cycle, keeping Freight Gross Bookings relatively flat due to lower revenue per load.\nFreight Adjusted EBITDA declined primarily attributable to a $4 million increase in Freight other expenses, partially offset by a

Carrier payments recorded in Freight Platform Participant direct transaction costs and a $14 million\n \ndecrease in Freight other expenses, partially offset by a\n \n$37 million decrease in Freight revenue.\n46\nCertain Key Metrics\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers.\n MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or received a Delivery order on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of transactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\nTrips. \nWe define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, an UberX Share ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\nGross Bookings. \nWe define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility rides, Delivery orders (in each case without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds, Driver and Merchant earnings, and Driver incentives) and Freight revenue. Gross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers. Gross Bookings are an indication of the scale of our current platform, which ultimately impacts revenue. \n47\nQ4 2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ4 2024\nQ1 2025\nQ2 2025\nQ3 2025\nMobility\n$\n19,285 \n$\n18,670 \n$\n20,554 \n$\n21,002 \n$\n22,798 \n$\n21,182 \n$\n23,762 \n$\n25,111 \nDelivery\n17,011 \n17,699 \n18,126 \n18,663 \n20,126 \n20,377 \n21,734 \n23,322 \nFreight\n1,279 \n1,282 \n1,272 \n1,308 \n1,273 \n1,259 \n1,260 \n1,307 \nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use \nAdjusted \nEBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.\nWe believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest expense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges.\nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements\nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements are primarily related to certain significant legal proceedings or governmental investigations related to worker classification definitions, or tax agencies challenging our non-income tax positions. These matters have limited precedent, cover extended historical periods and are unpredictable in both magnitude and timing, therefore are distinct from normal, recurring legal, tax and regulatory matters and related expenses incurred in our ongoing operating performance.\nLimitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash;\n48\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance;\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect period-to-period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net; and unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net; and\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.\n \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\nAdjusted EBITDA reconciliation:\nNet income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.\n$\n2,612\n \n$\n6,626\n \n$\n2,973\n \n$\n9,757\n \nAdd (deduct):\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax\n(13)\n26 \n(29)\n19 \nLoss from equity method investments\n12 \n14 \n28 \n39 \nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n158 \n(4,046)\n244 \n(4,306)\nOther (income) expense, net\n(1,851)\n(1,619)\n(1,593)\n(2,043)\nInterest expense\n143 \n112 \n406 \n325 \nIncome from operations\n1,061\n \n1,113\n \n2,029\n \n3,791\n \nAdd (deduct):\nDepreciation and amortization\n179 \n188 \n542 \n534 \nStock-based compensation expense\n438 \n465 \n1,377 \n1,375 \nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements\n— \n479 \n661 \n507 \nGoodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets\n— \n2 \n(3)\n2 \nAcquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses\n8 \n6 \n16 \n28 \nLoss on lease arrangement, net\n— \n— \n— \n2 \nRestructuring and related charges\n4 \n3 \n20 \n4 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,690\n \n$\n2,256\n \n$\n4,642\n \n$\n6,243\n \nConstant Currency\nWe compare the percent change in our current period results from the corresponding prior period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency growth rate information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying revenue performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating our current period financial results using the corresponding prior period’s monthly exchange rates for our transacted currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nFree Cash Flow\n \nWe define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for each of the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2025\nFree cash flow reconciliation:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n5,387\n \n$\n7,216\n \nPurchases of property and equipment\n(198)\n(261)\nFree cash flow\n$\n5,189\n \n$\n6,955\n \n49\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2025\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n5,387 \n$\n7,216 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(4,610)\n(1,950)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n1,310 \n(2,595)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $7.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily consisting of $9.8 billion of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily includes: $4.5 billion of deferred income taxes; $1.5 billion in unrealized gains on debt and equity securities, net; $1.4 billion of stock-based compensation expense; $554 million of depreciation and amortization expense, as well as a $1.6 billion increase in cash from working capital. The increase in cash from working capital was primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves primarily due to liabilities recorded during the period exceeding claims paid out, and accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to tax matters recorded as a receivable in other assets described in the “Non-Income Tax Matters” section below.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $5.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of $2.9 billion of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily includes: $1.4 billion of stock-based compensation expense, and $561 million of depreciation and amortization expense; \npartially offset by \n$1.3 billion in unrealized \ngains o\nn debt and equity securities, net.\n The increase in cash from working capital was primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves primarily due to liabilities recorded during the period exceeding claims paid out, and accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to tax matters recorded as a receivable in other assets described in the “Non-Income Tax Matters” section below.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily consisting of: purchases of marketable securities of $13.9 billion; acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired of $804 million; purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $286 million, and $261 million in purchases of property and equipment; partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $13.5 billion.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $4.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of: purchases of marketable securities of $9.7 billion; purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $288 million, and $198 million in purchases of property and equipment; partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $5.8 billion.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $2.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily consisting of: $4.6 billion in repurchases of common stock; $1.2 billion in principal repayment on term loan and notes, and $112 million of principal payments on finance leases; partially offset by $3.4 billion in issuance of term loan and notes, net of issuance costs, and $120 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. For additional information on the issuance and redemption of our senior notes, see Note 4 – Long-Term Debt and Credit Arrangements in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of: $4.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of term loan and notes, net of issuance costs; $103 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan; partially offset by $2.0 billion relating to our extinguishment of the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans; $697 million of repurchases of common stock, and $122 million of principal payments on finance leases.\nOther Information\nAs of September 30, 2025, $3.2 billion of our $8.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result in immaterial tax liabilities.\nWe believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We are in compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of September 30, 2025, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sources of funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our \n50\ncurrently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, collateral requirements, potential acquisitions, potential prepayments of contested indirect tax assessments (“pay-to-play”), and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidity.\nCommercial Paper\nIn June 2025, we established a commercial paper program (the “Program”) under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, not to exceed $2.0 billion outstanding at any time, with maturities of up to 397 days. The commercial paper notes will rank at least pari passu in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness except any indebtedness owing to creditors whose claims are mandatorily preferred by laws of general application. We intend to use the net proceeds of the Program for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2025, we had no commercial paper notes outstanding.\nDebt Redemptions\nIn September 2025, we exercised the call option and fully redeemed $700 million of the 2027 Senior Notes and $500 million of the 2028 Senior Notes, using a portion of the net proceeds from the 2031 Senior Notes and 2035 Senior Notes. In addition, we announced our intent to redeem the 2025 Convertible Notes pursuant to a scheduled redemption in December 2025. For additional information, see Note 4 – Long-Term Debt and Credit Arrangements in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn February 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion in shares of our outstanding common stock. In July 2025, our board of directors authorized an additional $20.0 billion for the repurchase of common stock. These authorizations (collectively, the “Share Repurchase Program”) total $27.0 billion. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are determined by the discretion of management, depending on market conditions and other factors. Repurchases may be made through open market purchases and accelerated share repurchases. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by us, if any, is not guaranteed. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or periodically without prior notice.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, we completed an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) to repurchase $1.5 billion of our outstanding common stock as part of our previously announced Share Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2025, we had approximately $21.1 billion available to repurchase shares pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program.\nFor additional information, see Note 6 – Stockholders' Equity in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nNon-Income Tax Matters\nAs of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of transportation and is required to remit VAT. Uber UK is remitting VAT under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987 (“VAT Order 1987”), which allows for VAT remittance on a calculated margin, rather than on Gross Bookings.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we have received multiple assessments from the HMRC disputing our application of VAT Order 1987 for the period of March 2022 to September 2024, totaling approximately $1.8 billion (£1.4 billion) for unpaid VAT. Uber paid the assessments in order to proceed with the appeal process. The payments do not represent our acceptance of the assessments.\nThe payments made in 2023 through 2025 are recorded as a receivable in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet because we believe that we will be successful in our appeal, upon which, the full amount of our payments will be returned to us with interest upon completion of the appeals process. We expect to receive additional assessments related to this matter. HMRC has expressed their intention to not enforce assessments pending the determination of the appeal of a competitor on a related matter. If payment of future assessments is required, the payments would decrease operating cash flow and have no impact on our results of operations. We plan to vigorously defend our application of the VAT Order 1987 and are waiting to obtain hearing dates from the Tax Tribunal. For additional information, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCommitments\nWe have non-cancelable commitments which primarily relate to network and cloud services and other items in the ordinary course of business. These amounts are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities to which we are contractually obligated. In July 2025, we agreed to purchase, or have our designated fleet operators purchase, a minimum of 20,000 Lucid vehicles equipped with Nuro’s Level 4 autonomous driving systems over a six-year period following the start of production, which is targeted for next year. This agreement is subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual outcomes to differ materially. \n51\nThese include, but are not limited to: production timelines; vehicles meeting certain quality thresholds and complying with other requirements; and fleet operator participation. Our cash requirement has not been determined and there can be no assurance that such purchases will be completed as contemplated. As of September 30, 2025, there have been no additional material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nFor additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the disclosure included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q."
