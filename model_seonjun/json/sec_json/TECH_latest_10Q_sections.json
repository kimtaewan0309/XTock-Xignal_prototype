MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL\nCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and segment level. We also provide quantitative information about discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with both the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information and related notes included in this Form 10-Q, and MD&A of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2025. This discussion contains various “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and also contains various “Forward-Looking Statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Forward-Looking Information and Cautionary Statements” located at the end of Item 2 of this report.\nOVERVIEW\nBio-Techne and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Bio-Techne Corporation (Bio-Techne, we, our, us or the Company) develop, manufacture and sell biotechnology reagents, instruments and services for the research and clinical diagnostic markets worldwide. With our deep product portfolio and application expertise, we sell integral components of scientific investigations into biological processes and molecular diagnostics, revealing the nature, diagnosis, etiology and progression of specific diseases. Our products aid in drug discovery efforts and provide the means for accurate clinical tests and diagnoses.\nWe are committed to providing the life sciences community with innovative, high-quality scientific tools that allow our customers to make extraordinary discoveries and treat and diagnose diseases. We intend to build on Bio-Techne’s past accomplishments, high product quality reputation and sound financial position by executing strategies that position us to serve as the standard for biological content in the research market, and to leverage that leadership position to enter the diagnostics and other adjacent markets. The Company’s strategic pillars for long-term growth and profitability are grow and leverage the core, capitalize on high potential markets, market expansion through innovation and acquisition, deliver best-in-class customer experience, and develop people through a transformative culture.\nOur Protein Sciences segment is a leading developer and manufacturer of high-quality purified proteins and reagent solutions, most notably cytokines and growth factors, antibodies, immunoassays, biologically active small molecule compounds, tissue culture reagents and T-Cell activation technologies. This segment also includes protein analysis solutions that offer researchers efficient and streamlined options for automated western blot and multiplexed ELISA workflow. Our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment develops and manufactures diagnostic products, including FDA-regulated controls, calibrators, blood gas and clinical chemistry controls and other reagents for OEM and clinical customers, as well as a portfolio of clinical molecular diagnostic oncology assays. This segment also manufactures and sells advanced tissue-based in-situ hybridization assays (ISH) for research and clinical use.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\nConsolidated net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 were $286.6 million, a decrease of 1% compared to the same prior year period. Organic revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 decreased 1% compared to the prior year, with foreign currency exchange having a favorable impact of 1% and businesses held-for-sale having an unfavorable impact of 1%. Organic revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 was primarily driven by favorable performance by our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology portfolio offset by volume pressure in our Protein Sciences segment. \nGross Margins\nConsolidated gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 was 65.6% compared to 63.2% for the same prior year period. Excluding the impact of costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and restructuring-related costs, and the impact of businesses held-for-sale, adjusted gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 was 70.2% compared to 69.5% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Fluctuations in consolidated gross margin and adjusted gross margin, as a percentage of sales, have primarily resulted from changes in product mix and a reduction in restructuring charges. We expect that, in the future, gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions. \n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages, adjusted for acquired inventory sold, intangible amortization, stock compensation expense, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, and the impact of businesses held-for-sale included in Cost of sales, is as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nQuarter Ended\n​\n​\n​\nSeptember 30, \n​\n​\n \n​\n2025\n​\n2024\n​\nTotal consolidated net sales\n​\n$\n 286,555\n​\n$\n 289,458\n​\nBusiness held-for-sale\n(1)\n​\n​\n 5,439\n​\n​\n 2,303\n​\nRevenue from recurring operations\n​\n$\n 281,116\n​\n$\n 287,155\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGross margin - GAAP\n​\n$\n 188,112\n​\n$\n 183,017\n​\nGross margin percentage - GAAP\n​\n​\n 65.6\n%\n​\n 63.2\n%\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIdentified adjustments:\n \n​\n  \n​\n​\n  \n​\nCosts recognized upon sale of acquired inventory\n \n$\n —\n​\n$\n 188\n​\nAmortization of intangibles\n \n​\n 9,439\n​\n​\n 11,779\n​\nStock-based compensation, inclusive of employer taxes\n \n​\n 385\n​\n​\n 272\n​\nRestructuring and restructuring-related costs\n​\n​\n 2,079\n​\n​\n 4,898\n​\nImpact of business held-for-sale\n(1)\n​\n​\n (2,581)\n​\n​\n (558)\n​\nAdjusted gross margin\n \n$\n 197,434\n​\n$\n 199,596\n​\nAdjusted gross margin percentage\n(2)\n​\n​\n 70.2\n%\n​\n 69.5\n%\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n(1)\nSeptember 30, 2024 amounts relate to the Protein Sciences segment business that met the held-for-sale criteria on December 31, 2023.

The decrease in expenses was due to cost management initiatives. \nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased 2% to $24.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 from the same prior year period. The increase in expenses was due to timing of strategic growth investments, offset by cost management initiatives. \nSegment Results\nProtein Sciences\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nQuarter Ended \n​\n​\n​\nSeptember 30, \n​\n​\n​\n2025\n   \n2024\n   \nNet sales (in thousands)\n \n$\n 202,188\n​\n$\n 204,535\n​\nOperating margin percentage\n \n \n 38.4\n%  \n \n 39.4\n%  \n​\nThe Protein Sciences segment’s net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 was $202.2 million, which decreased 1% compared to the same respective prior year period. As of December 31, 2023, a business within the Protein Sciences segment met the criteria as held-for-sale; this held-for-sale business has been excluded from the segment’s fiscal 2026 and 2025 operating results. \nOrganic revenue for the segment decreased 3%, and foreign currency exchange had a favorable impact of 2%.\nThe operating margin was 38.4% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to 39.4% in the comparative prior year period. The segment’s operating margin was unfavorably impacted by a reduction in volume leverage.\n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDiagnostics and Spatial Biology\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nQuarter Ended \n​\n​\n​\nSeptember 30, \n​\n​\n​\n2025\n   \n2024\n   \nNet sales (in thousands)\n \n$\n 79,458\n​\n$\n 83,192\n​\nOperating margin percentage\n \n \n 11.2\n%  \n \n 5.1\n%  \nThe Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment’s net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 was $79.5 million, with a reported decrease of 4% compared to the same respective prior year period. \nOrganic revenue growth was 3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, with foreign currency exchange having an immaterial impact.\n As of June 30, 2025, a business within the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment met the criteria as held-for-sale; this held-for-sale business has been excluded from the segment’s fiscal 2026 operating results and had an unfavorable impact of 7%. \nThe operating margin for the segment was 11.2% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 compared to 5.1% in the comparative prior year period. The segment’s operating margin was favorably impacted by the Exosome Diagnostics divestiture and productivity initiatives. \nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes were at an effective rate of 20.4% of consolidated earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, compared to 16.4% for the same respective prior year period. The change in the Company’s tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 was driven by the mix of net income. \nThe forecasted tax rate as of the first fiscal quarter of 2026 before discrete items is 26.5% compared to the prior year forecasted tax rate before discrete items of 23.6%. Excluding the impact of discrete items, the Company expects the consolidated income tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2026 to range from 26% to 30%.\n​\n​\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNet Earnings\n​\nNon-GAAP adjusted consolidated net earnings are as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nQuarter Ended\n​\n​\nSeptember 30, \n​\n \n2025\n​\n2024\n​\nNet earnings before taxes \n- \nGAAP\n    \n$\n 47,991\n​\n$\n 40,171\n​\nIdentified adjustments: \n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAmortization of intangibles\n​\n \n 15,350\n​\n \n 19,741\n​\nAmortization of Wilson Wolf intangible assets\n​\n​\n 2,490\n​\n​\n 2,490\n​\nAcquisition related expenses and other\n​\n \n 3,508\n​\n \n 1,862\n​\nCertain litigation charges\n​\n​\n 2,408\n​\n​\n 292\n​\nStock-based compensation, inclusive of employer taxes\n​\n \n 12,096\n​\n \n 10,637\n​\nRestructuring and restructuring-related costs\n​\n \n 7,511\n​\n \n 11,022\n​\nInvestment gain and other non-operating income\n​\n​\n (2,146)\n​\n​\n —\n​\nRecovery of assets held-for-sale\n​\n​\n (6,789)\n​\n​\n —\n​\nImpact of business held-for-sale\n(1)\n​\n​\n 2,573\n​\n​\n (148)\n​\nNet earnings before taxes - Adjusted\n​\n$\n 84,992\n​\n$\n 86,067\n​\nNon-GAAP tax rate\n​\n \n 22.3\n%  \n \n 21.5\n%  \nNon-GAAP tax expense\n​\n$\n 18,953\n​\n$\n 18,536\n​\nNon-GAAP adjusted net earnings\n​\n$\n 66,039\n​\n$\n 67,531\n​\nEarnings per share - diluted - Adjusted\n​\n$\n 0.42\n​\n$\n 0.42\n​\n(1)\nSeptember 30, 2024 amounts relate to the Protein Sciences segment business that met the held-for-sale criteria on December 31, 2023.

The Company independently calculates a non-GAAP adjusted tax rate considering the impact of discrete items and jurisdictional mix of the identified non-GAAP adjustments. The following table summarizes the reported GAAP tax rate and the effective non-GAAP adjusted tax rate for the quarters ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nQuarter Ended\n​\n​\nSeptember 30, \n​\n    \n2025\n​\n2024\nGAAP effective tax rate\n \n 20.4\n%  \n​\n 16.4\n%  \nDiscrete items\n​\n 6.1\n​\n​\n 7.2\n​\nLong-term GAAP tax rate\n \n 26.5\n%  \n​\n 23.6\n%  \nRate impact items \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nStock based compensation\n \n (2.7)\n%\n​\n (2.8)\n%\nOther\n​\n (1.5)\n​\n​\n 0.7\n​\nTotal rate impact items\n \n (4.2)\n%\n​\n (2.1)\n%  \nNon-GAAP adjusted tax rate\n \n 22.3\n%  \n​\n 21.5\n%  \nThe difference between the reported GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP tax rate applied to the identified non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 is primarily a result of discrete tax items, including the tax benefit of stock option exercises.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash and cash equivalents were $145.0 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $162.2 million as of June 30, 2025.\nThe Company has a line-of-credit governed by a Credit Agreement dated August 31, 2022 that will mature on August 31, 2027. As of September 30, 2025, there is $700 million available on the line-of-credit. See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Credit Agreement. \n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company paid $25 million to enter into a two-part forward contract which requires the Company to purchase the full equity interest in Wilson Wolf if certain annual revenue or EBITDA thresholds are met. During fiscal year 2023, Wilson Wolf met the EBITDA target and the Company paid an additional $232 million to acquire 19.9% of Wilson Wolf. Since the first part of the forward contract has been triggered, the second part of the forward contract will automatically trigger, which requires the Company to acquire the remaining 80.1% of Wilson Wolf on December 31, 2027. The second part of the contract would be accelerated in advance of December 31, 2027 if Wilson Wolf meets certain financial milestones. As of September 30, 2025, the second milestones have not been met. The second option payment of approximately $1 billion plus potential contingent consideration is forecasted to occur between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2028.\nManagement of the Company expects to be able to meet its cash and working capital requirements for operations, facility expansion, capital additions, and cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and at least the next 12 months, through currently available cash, cash generated from operations, and remaining credit available on its existing revolving line of credit.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nThe Company generated cash of $27.6 million from operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to $63.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The decrease from the prior year was primarily due to changes in the timing of cash payments on certain operating assets and liabilities.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nWe continue to make investments in our business, including capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures for fixed assets for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025 were $5.4 million and $9.2 million, respectively. Capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal 2026 are expected to be approximately $27 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be financed through currently available funds and cash generated from operating activities. Expected additions in fiscal 2026 are related to increasing capacity to meet expected sales growth across the Company.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the Company received $4.6 million for assets held-for-sale. There was no comparable activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company invested $15.0 million into Spear Bio. There was no comparable activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2025, certificates of deposit reached maturity for $1.1 million. There was no comparable activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. \nThe Company received tax distributions of $1.4 million from its equity method investee during the first quarter of both fiscal 2026 and 2025.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, the Company paid cash dividends of $12.4 million and $12.7 million, respectively, to all common shareholders. On November 5, 2025, the Company announced the payment of a $0.08 per share cash dividend, or approximately $12.5 million, will be payable November 28, 2025 to all common shareholders of record on November 17, 2025. \nCash of $23.5 million and $25.1 million was received during the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively, from the exercise of stock options.\n \nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, the Company made repayments of $46.0 million and $19.0 million, respectively, on its long-term debt balance. The Company did not draw under its revolving line-of-credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, the Company paid taxes of $9.2 million and $5.0 million related to taxes on restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options exercised through a net share settlement.\n​\n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2025 and are incorporated herein by reference. The application of certain of these policies requires judgments and estimates that can affect the results of operations and financial position of the Company. Judgments and estimates are used for, but not limited to, valuation of available-for-sale investments, inventory valuation and allowances, valuation of intangible assets and goodwill and valuation of investments in unconsolidated entities. There have been no significant changes in estimates in the quarter ended September 30, 2025 that would require disclosure nor have there been any changes to the Company's policies.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” in Item 2, contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include:\n●\nOrganic revenue\n●\nAdjusted gross margin\n●\nAdjusted operating margin\n●\nAdjusted net earnings and diluted earnings per share\n●\nAdjusted effective tax rate\nWe provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.\nOur non-GAAP financial measure of organic revenue represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceding 12 months, the impact of foreign currency, the impact of businesses held-for-sale, as well as the impact of partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries. Excluding these measures provides more useful period-to-period comparison of revenue results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which can vary significantly from period to period, and revenue from acquisitions that would not be included in the comparable prior period. \nRevenues from businesses held-for-sale are excluded from our organic revenue calculation starting on the date they become held-for-sale as those revenues will not be comparative in future periods. \nRevenues from partially-owned subsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements are also excluded from our organic revenue calculation\n, \nas those revenues are not fully attributable to the Company. There was no revenue from partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries in fiscal years 2026 or 2025. \nOur non-GAAP financial measures for adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, exclude stock-based compensation, \nwhich is inclusive of the employer portion of payroll taxes on those stock awards\n, \nthe costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of acquisition intangibles, \nrestructuring and restructuring-related costs\n. Stock-based compensation is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted net earnings because of the nature of this charge, specifically the varying available valuation methodologies, subjection assumptions, variety of award types, and unpredictability of amount and timing of employer related tax obligations. The Company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments, including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, and other non-recurring items including gains or losses on goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and one-time assessments from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events, and are not reflective of our internal investments\n, \nthe costs of developing, producing, supporting and selling our products, and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure. Costs related to restructuring and restructuring-related activities, including reducing overhead and consolidating facilities, are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs.  Additionally, these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity. The Company also excludes revenue and expense attributable to partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries as well as revenue and expense attributable to businesses held-for-sale in the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company’s non-GAAP adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes acquisition related expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value of contingent consideration, and other non-recurring items including certain costs related to the transition to a new CEO, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and gains. We also exclude certain litigation charges which are facts and circumstances specific including costs to resolve litigation and legal settlement (gains and losses). \n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn some cases, these costs may be a result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were not probable, inestimable, or unresolved at the time of acquisition.\n \nThe Company’s non-GAAP adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes \ngain and losses from investments, as they are not part of our day-to-day operating decisions (excluding our equity method investment in Wilson Wolf as it is certain to be acquired in the future) and certain adjustments to income tax expense.\n \nAdditionally, gains and losses from investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are excluded. The Company independently calculates a non-GAAP adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified non-GAAP adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments. In addition, the tax impact of other discrete and non-recurring charges which impact our reported GAAP tax rate are adjusted from net earnings. We believe these tax items can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results.\nThe Company periodically reassesses the components of our non-GAAP adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance, changes in how we make financial and operational decisions, and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful.\nReaders are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures used in management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition of the Company to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nThis quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those regarding the Company's expectations as to the effect of changes to accounting policies, the amount of capital expenditures for the remainder of the fiscal year, the source of funding for capital expenditure requirements, the sufficiency of currently available funds for meeting the Company's needs, the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and expectations regarding gross margin fluctuations, increasing research and development expenses, increasing Selling, general and administrative expenses and income tax rates. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may affect the actual results of operations. The following important factors, among others, have affected and, in the future, could affect the Company's actual results: integration of newly acquired businesses, the introduction and acceptance of new products, general national and international economic, political, regulatory, and other conditions, increased competition, the reliance on internal manufacturing and related operations, supply chain challenges, the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations, the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, the impact of governmental regulation, maintenance of intellectual property rights, credit risk and fluctuation in the market value of the Company's investment portfolio, and unseen delays and expenses related to facility construction and improvements. For additional information concerning such factors, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2025 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Part II.
