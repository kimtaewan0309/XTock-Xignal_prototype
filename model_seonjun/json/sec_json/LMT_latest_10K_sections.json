We also develop and own other intellectual property, including copyrights, trade secrets and research, development and engineering know-how, that contributes significantly to our business. In addition, we license intellectual property to and from third parties. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) provide the U.S. Government certain rights in intellectual property, including patents, developed by us and our subcontractors and suppliers in performance of government contracts or with government funding. The U.S. Government may use or authorize others, including competitors, to use such intellectual property. See the discussion of matters related to our intellectual property in Item 1A - Risk Factors. Non-U.S. governments also may have certain rights in patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of our contracts for them. Although our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business, we do not believe that any existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business taken as a whole.\nResearch and Development\nWe conduct research and development (R&D) activities using our own funds (referred to as company-funded or independent R&D (IR&D)) and under contractual arrangements with our customers (referred to as customer-funded R&D) to enhance existing products and services and to develop future technologies. R&D costs include basic research, applied research, concept formulation studies, design, development, and related test activities. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” (under the caption “Research and development and similar costs”) included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n5\nTable of Contents \nRaw Materials, Suppliers and Seasonality\nSome of our products require relatively scarce raw materials, such as rare earth minerals. Other important materials and components, on which certain of our products rely, include aluminum, titanium, specialty steel, carbon fiber and advanced microelectronics, such as semiconductors. We rely on other companies to provide materials, components and products and to perform a portion of the services that are provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. Although long-term agreements have historically helped enable a continued supply of these materials, supply chain challenges, supplier disputes, regulatory restrictions, and inflationary pressures have caused certain parts’ shortages, extended lead times and pricing escalations affecting certain sources of supply. We are working with U.S. Government, customers and suppliers on phase-in of regulatory requirements for transitioning the supply chains for rare earth minerals and magnets to secure and compliant sources. The current availability of sources of supply meeting regulatory requirements and the ability to ensure compliance down to the mining level within the timeframes required by the regulations are challenges we continue to work with our multi-tier supplier base. At the same time, we are focused on minimizing the impact of these supply chain challenges on our programs. However, many of the challenges are industry wide or caused by geopolitical events and general economic conditions that are outside of our control. These supplier disruptions have resulted in delays and increased costs and have adversely affected our program performance and operating results. These dynamics are expected to continue in 2025. For more information on the risks related to our suppliers and raw materials, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nNo material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal. Various factors, however, can affect the distribution of our sales between accounting periods, including the timing of government awards, the availability of government funding, product deliveries and customer acceptance.\nHuman Capital\nDue to the specialized nature of our business, our performance depends on identifying, attracting, developing, motivating and retaining a highly skilled workforce with the requisite skills and, in many cases, security clearances, in multiple areas, including engineering, science, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, business development and strategy and management. Our human capital management strategy, which we refer to as our people strategy, tightly aligns to our business needs and technology strategy and focused in 2024 on continuing to accelerate the transformation of our technology for workforce management through investments in upgraded systems and processes, increasing our ability to meet the quickly changing needs of our business, and maintaining a working environment and culture that is supportive of all employees and reflects our core value of “Respect Others.” We structure our people strategy and its implementation to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject as a federal government contractor.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a highly skilled workforce made up of approximately 121,000 employees, including approximately 70,000 engineers, scientists and information technology professionals. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 93% of our workforce was located in the U.S. and approximately 19% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. A number of our existing collective bargaining agreements expire in any given year. Historically, we have been successful in renegotiating expiring agreements without any material disruption of operating activities, and management considers employee and union relations to be good. This has continued to be the case in 2024.\nWe strive to hire, develop and retain the top talent in the industry. During 2024, we hired nearly 9,200 employees and we hired 3,900 college hires and interns during the 2023-24 academic year. An integral part of our people strategy is early career hiring through college and intern pipelines, particularly in technical fields and critical skills areas. We seek to access the broadest possible pool of talent to enable us to meet our hiring needs, and we work to expand Lockheed Martin’s brand awareness and positioning as a best place to work. \nEmployee satisfaction is essential to attracting and retaining top talent, and we regularly conduct employee engagement surveys to gauge employee satisfaction and to understand the effectiveness of our people strategy and assess employees’ intent to stay. We attract and reward our employees by providing market competitive compensation and benefits, including incentives and recognition plans that extend to non-represented employees of all levels in our organization and encourage excellence through our pay-for-performance philosophy. We have a hybrid workforce model that enables flexible working arrangements for employees and teams who can meet our customer commitments remotely, which has helped recruit and retain talent. In addition, we invest in the development of our employees through training, apprenticeship programs, security clearance sponsorship, leadership development plans and offering tuition assistance programs for continuing education or industry certifications. We believe this employee development makes us more competitive and assists with leadership succession planning throughout the company. In addition to efforts focused on recruitment and retention, we also monitor employee attrition across our employee population and take action based on the insights we gain from that monitoring process.\n6\nTable of Contents \nEmployee Safety and Health\nThrough our safety and health program we seek to optimize our operations with targeted safety, health and wellness opportunities designed to provide safe work conditions and a healthy work environment, promote workforce resiliency and enhance business value. As part of this program, we track employee health and safety measures, including quarterly and yearly targets related to the number of injury and illness incidents that occur at work, those incidents that result in days lost, and the number of days lost due to workplace injuries and illness.\nFor information on the risks related to our human capital resources, see Item 1A – Risk Factors.\nCompetition\nWe compete with many different companies both within and outside of the defense and aerospace industry. The Boeing Company, General Dynamics, L3Harris Technologies, Northrop Grumman, and RTX Corporation are some of our primary competitors. Key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition, which is evident through the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities and the existence of bid protests (competitor protests of U.S. Government procurement awards).\nWe often collaborate with our competitors through teaming arrangements in efforts to provide our customers with the best mix of capabilities to address specific requirements, such as our recently announced strategic teaming agreement with General Dynamics to produce solid rocket motors, enhancing security and resilience in a critical domestic supply chain. Additionally, a company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor, serve as a subcontractor to the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts.\nOur broad portfolio of products and services competes domestically and internationally against products and services of the companies listed above, numerous smaller competitors and startups, and increasingly, non-traditional and non-U.S. defense contractors. In some areas of our business, customer requirements are changing to encourage or facilitate expanded competition. Principal factors of competition include: the technical excellence, reliability, safety and cost competitiveness of our products and services to the customer; technical and management capability; the ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies that improve mission performance and adapt to dynamic threats; successful program execution and on-time delivery of complex, integrated systems; the reputation and customer confidence derived from past performance; our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against contract requirements and successfully manage customer relationships; and our global footprint and accessibility to customers. \nThe competition for international sales for most of our products and services is subject to U.S. Government stipulations (e.g., export restrictions, market access, technology transfer, industrial cooperation and contracting practices). We compete against U.S. and non-U.S. companies (or teams) for contract awards by international governments. International competitions are also subject to different laws or contracting practices of international governments, which affects how we structure our bid for the procurement. In many international procurements, the purchasing government’s relationship with the U.S. and its industrial cooperation programs designed to enhance local industry are important factors in determining the outcome of a competition. It is common for international customers to require contractors to comply with their industrial cooperation regulations, sometimes referred to as offset requirements, and we have entered into foreign offset agreements as part of securing some international business. For more information concerning our international business, see “International Business” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 1A – Risk Factors.\nTechnological advances in such areas as additive manufacturing, data analytics, digital engineering, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, autonomy and robotics, and new business models such as commercial access to space, are enabling new factors of competition for both traditional and non-traditional competitors. For more information on the risks related to new technologies, see Item 1A - Risk Factors. \nRegulatory Matters\nOur business is heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, principally all branches of the U.S. military and NASA. We also contract with similar government authorities in other countries, either under the foreign military sales (FMS) program, contracted through the U.S. Government, or as a direct sale with the foreign government authority, which regulates these sales in a manner similar to the U.S. Government.\n7\nTable of Contents \nGovernment Contracts\nWe must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government and other governments’ contracts, including foreign governments. These laws and regulations, among other things:\n•\nrequire certification and disclosure of all cost or pricing data in connection with certain types of contract negotiations; \n•\nimpose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP);\n•\nimpose acquisition regulations, which may change or be replaced over time, that define which costs can be charged to the U.S. Government, how and when costs can be charged, and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain U.S. Government and foreign contracts; \n•\nrequire specific security controls to protect U.S. Government controlled unclassified information and that our suppliers that have access to this type of information comply with cyber security regulations;\n•\nrestrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data;\n•\nprohibit the acquisition from or use by contractors of materials, products or services procured from certain countries or entities located outside the United States (e.g., the prohibition on the acquisition of sensitive materials from non-allied foreign nations and prohibition on the acquisition and use of certain telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment); and\n•\nrequire the review and approval of contractor business systems, including accounting systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems for managing cost and schedule performance on certain complex programs, purchasing systems, material management and accounting systems for planning, controlling and accounting for the acquisition, use, issuing and disposition of material, and property management systems. \nThe U.S. Government and in limited cases certain other governments may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts either at their convenience or for default based on our performance. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we generally are protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract and profit on those costs. If a contract is terminated for default, we generally are entitled to payment for our work that has been accepted by the U.S. Government or other governments; however, the U.S. Government and other governments could make claims to reduce our recovery or recoup its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. For more information regarding the U.S. Government’s and other governments’ right to terminate our contracts and the risks of doing work internationally, see Item 1A – Risk Factors. For more information regarding government contracting laws and regulations, see Item 1A – Risk Factors as well as “Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAdditionally, our programs for the U.S. Government often operate for periods of time under undefinitized contract actions (UCAs), which means that we begin performing our obligations before the terms, specifications or price are finally agreed to between the parties. Although in most cases we historically have reached mutual agreement to definitize our UCAs, the U.S. Government has the ability to unilaterally definitize contracts and has done so in the past. Absent a successful appeal of such action, the unilateral definitization of the contract obligates us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government’s power to unilaterally definitize a contract can affect our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms and, if a contract is unilaterally imposed upon us, it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flows on a program or impose burdensome terms.\nClassified Contracts\nA portion of our business is classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of classified contracts are included in our consolidated financial statements. The business risks and capital requirements associated with classified contracts historically have not differed materially from those of our other U.S. Government contracts. However, under certain classified fixed-price development and production contracts, we are unable to insure risk of loss to government property because of the classified nature of the contracts and the inability to disclose classified information necessary for underwriting and claims to commercial insurers. Our internal controls addressing the financial reporting of classified contracts are consistent with our internal controls for our non-classified contracts.\n8\nTable of Contents \nCommercial Aircraft\nOur commercial aircraft products are required to comply with U.S. and international regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety.\nEnvironmental\nOur operations are subject to and affected by various federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise regulating the protection of the environment. As a result of these environmental protection laws, we are involved in environmental remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party-owned sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party as a result of our prior activities and those of our predecessor companies. Although the extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated, the costs of environmental compliance have not had, and we do not expect that these costs will have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, primarily because substantially all of our environmental costs are allowable in establishing the price of our products and services under our contracts with the U.S. Government. For information regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for remediation or cleanup to the extent that they are probable and estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental Matters” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also the discussion of environmental matters in Item 1A – Risk Factors.\nClimate and Sustainability Reporting and Regulation \nThere is an increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change. Various jurisdictions around the world in which we operate, including the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia and certain U.S. States, have adopted or proposed laws related to climate and sustainability reporting. These and future laws, regulations or policies in response to concerns over GHG emissions such as carbon taxes, mandatory reporting and disclosure obligations, including environmental requirements for certain federal contractors and subcontractors, and changes in procurement policies, including the use of environmental goals in proposal evaluation, could significantly increase our operational and compliance burdens and costs. We monitor developments in climate change-related regulation for their potential effect on us and also have a comprehensive sustainability program that seeks to mitigate our impact on the environment, including targets to reduce our GHG emissions. For more information on the risk of climate-change related regulation, see Item 1A – Risk Factors.\nOther Applicable Regulations\nOur business and operations are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to product testing, import-export controls, technology transfer restrictions, foreign investment, tariffs, taxation, repatriation of earnings, sanctions, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Control Reform Act of 2018. \nAvailable Information\nWe are a Maryland corporation formed in 1995 by combining the businesses of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta Corporation.

In 2024, 73% of our $71.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 65% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 26% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers.\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. \nOur 21st Century Security\n®\n vision is to accelerate the adoption of advanced networking and other leading-edge technologies into the American defense enterprise, while enhancing the performance and value of our platforms and products for our customers. The aim of 21st Century Security is to integrate and continuously upgrade new and existing systems across all domains with advanced, open-architecture networking and operational technologies that make defense forces more agile, adaptive and unpredictable, enabling overmatch and strengthening deterrence today and into the future.\n21st Century Security guides our strategy and investments. As our growth pillars continue to evolve, we are focusing on advancing all-domain mission solutions through investments in digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML), Autonomy and Crewed/Uncrewed Teaming, Generative Design and other technologies and capabilities enabling Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2). Innovations in these areas will expand capability, improve interoperability, increase demand for our multi-domain solutions and drive efficient conversion of backlog into growth across our portfolio. We have well established programs across our business segments that continue to experience growth, including F-35 sustainment activity (Aeronautics); increased Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) production rates and increased demand for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS\n®\n) and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) (Missiles and Fire Control); radar surveillance systems and CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter (Rotary and Mission Systems); and the modernization of and enhancements to the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) (Space). Additionally, our teams continue to transform our products and rapidly innovate for the future, developing 6th generation air dominance technologies within Skunk Works\n®\n, demonstrating autonomous capabilities with the X-62A (F-16) and optionally piloted BLACK HAWK\n®\n, creating new Joint All-Domain Operating systems with Defense of Guam and AIR 6500 in Australia, establishing small-to-medium satellite capabilities to support proliferated space constellations and advancing hypersonic capabilities. Finally, we are always in pursuit of new program awards to develop future platforms that enable us to continue to strengthen our national defense and advance deterrence and global security.\nKeys to enabling success of our strategy include developing and investing in differentiating technologies, forging strategic partnerships, including with commercial companies, executing on our multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance our digital infrastructure and increase efficiencies and collaboration throughout our business and maintaining fiscal discipline. Underpinning our ability to execute our strategy is our talent and culture. We invest substantially in our people to ensure that our workforce has the technical skills necessary to succeed, and we expect to continue to invest internally in innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. We also will continue to evaluate our portfolio and will make strategic acquisitions or divestitures, as appropriate, while deepening our connection to commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures and equity investments. \n29\nTable of Contents \nPortfolio Shaping Activities\nWe continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.\nWe selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses, investments and ventures at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses, investments or ventures that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization or with a different owner. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments.\nOn September 9, 2024, we completed the sale of our Commercial Engine Solutions (CES) business, which was part of our Aeronautics business segment. We received $170 million in cash from the sale. Gains recognized from the sale in 2024 were not significant. The final gain is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including final working capital, indemnification, and tax adjustments, which we expect to complete in 2025. This sale did not represent a strategic shift and the impacts to our consolidated results of operation, financial position, and cash were not significant. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows for the CES business up to the divestiture date have not been reclassified to discontinued operations.\nOn October 30, 2024, we closed our acquisition of Terran Orbital Corporation (Terran Orbital) for a purchase consideration of $314 million, which will be included in our Space business segment. Terran Orbital’s product and service offerings include satellite design, production, launch planning, mission operations, and on-orbit support for the aerospace and defense industries. We believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings, provide additional innovative solutions to meet our customers’ emerging requirements, and provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees. The financial results of Terran Orbital have been included within our operating results in the period post-acquisition. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of Terran Orbital.\nU.S. Budget Environment\nWith approximately three quarters of our sales from the U.S. Government, U.S. Government spending levels, particularly defense spending, and timely funding thereof can affect our financial performance over the short and long term.\nOn March 22, 2024, the President signed into law the second Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Consolidated Appropriations package, which includes the DoD funding. This legislation reflects the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA) spending limit of $886 billion for National Defense, of which $842 billion was for the DoD base budget.\nThe President’s FY 2025 budget request was submitted to Congress on March 11, 2024, initiating the FY 2025 defense authorization and appropriations legislative process. The request included $895 billion for National Defense, of which $850 billion is for the DoD base budget, in keeping with the limit established by the FRA. While compression on overall requirements driven by the FRA limit is evident, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has stated the FY 2025 budget proposal meets their objectives of keeping National Defense Strategy priorities on track.\nOn April 24, 2024, the President signed a bill providing a total of $95 billion in additional supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, including funding for the restock of U.S. munitions capacity. Supplemental funding legislation is not subject to the FRA limits.\nThe House and Senate continue the legislative process on the FY 2025 budget. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025, signed by the President on December 24, 2024, is consistent with the FY 2025 President’s Budget Request (PBR) and Congressionally mandated budget caps established by the FRA with a topline of $849.8 billion. The House Appropriations Committee also marked its bill at this same level. The Senate Appropriations Committee, however, did not adhere to the FRA spending caps and marked budgets above the PBR, providing between a $21 billion and $25 billion increase over the PBR level. Regardless of toplines, all four Committees support additional funding for several of our programs, spread across our four business areas.\nCongress still needs to approve or revise the President’s FY 2025 budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final approval from the President in order for the FY 2025 budget process to conclude. A second Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY 2025 passed the House and Senate on December 20, 2024, and was signed by the President on December 21, 2024. The bill funds U.S. Government operations through March 14, 2025. In addition to the Continuing Resolution, the President also signed the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act on December 21, 2024, which includes more than $100 billion in supplemental funding. Of note, the final version of the bill did \n30\nTable of Contents \nnot address the debt ceiling, which is set to expire mid-January 2025 and is expected to cause challenges at the start of the 119th Congressional negotiations. Once the debt ceiling is reached, Treasury may have to use extraordinary measures to prevent default. Treasury’s available cash and any extraordinary measures taken should delay the risk of default for at least several months after the end of the first quarter of 2025. In the upcoming months, the new Congress will return to the task of funding the U.S. Government for the balance of FY 2025. Significant differences that must be resolved include the different allocations as noted above and policy matters that arose during consideration of the CR and the underlying bills.\nWe anticipate the federal budget will continue to be subject to debate and compromise shaped by, among other things, the new Administration and Congress, the global security environment, inflationary pressures, and macroeconomic conditions. The result may be shifting funding priorities, which could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and our programs.\nGeopolitical and Economic Environment\nWe operate in a complex and evolving global security environment and our business is affected by geopolitical and security issues. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East and heightened tension in the Pacific region have elevated global security concerns resulting in increased interest for our products and services as countries seek to improve their security posture. In this context, the U.S. Government, our largest customer, continues to align its budget with the defense priorities set forth in the 2022 National Defense Strategy. In addition, security assistance provided by the U.S. Government and its allies to Ukraine has increased U.S. Government and allied demand to replenish U.S. stockpiles, resulting in additional and potential future orders, including for the ramp-up in production capacity for certain products. We continue to expect additional orders over the next several years attributable to the global threat environment. We operate primarily in a long-cycle business and the U.S. Government has been focused on increasing industry capacity to meet demand. We continue to work with the U.S. Government and our supply chain to evaluate increases in capacity at our operations to anticipate potential demand and enable us to deliver critical capabilities.\nOur business and financial performance is also affected by general economic conditions. We continue to experience supply chain challenges, including supplier shortages and performance issues. These issues have delayed certain customer deliveries, have been a limiting factor on our ability to ramp up production in response to customer demand for certain products and have caused out-of-sequence manufacturing, which increases costs and decreases operational efficiency. In addition, elevated levels of inflation and macroeconomic conditions present risks for us, our suppliers and the stability of the broader defense industrial base. Certain costs, including rising labor rates and supplier costs, have increased as a result of inflation, and have adversely affected our margins on certain programs. In addition, some suppliers are reducing the duration of pricing validity of their proposals to us or seeking to reopen pricing on existing agreements, which is operationally challenging and increases the risk of cost volatility. We continue to work to mitigate challenges caused by the supply chain or current macroeconomic environment on our business, including by supporting small business and at-risk suppliers, deploying resources to work with our supply chain, securing materials and support by executing long-term contracts, enforcing existing contract terms, identifying alternative sources, collaborating with our customers to address industry-wide challenges, and optimizing our supply chain organization through digital transformation and workforce development. If we experience significant supply chain issues or high rates of inflation, and are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our future profits, margins and cash flows, particularly for existing fixed-price contracts, may be adversely affected. Inflation and higher interest rates can also constrain the overall purchasing power of our customers for our products and services potentially impacting future orders, especially in a budget constrained environment. We remain committed to our ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the cost competitiveness and affordability of our products and services, which may, in part, offset cost increases from inflation.\nInternational Business\nA key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. Our international business is conducted either by FMS contracted through the U.S. Government or by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. In 2024, approximately 73% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 27% were DCS. Additionally, in 2024, substantially all of our sales from international customers were in our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments. Space’s sales from international customers were not material in 2024. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.\nIn 2024, international customers accounted for 32% of Aeronautics’ net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. Government and seven international partner countries and twelve FMS customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production and sustainment of the F-35 program. Other areas of \n31\nTable of Contents \ninternational expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs, which continue to draw interest from international customers for new aircraft.\nIn 2024, international customers accounted for 29% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the PAC-3 and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. Seventeen nations have chosen PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) to provide missile defense capabilities. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical and strike missile products, where we received orders from Poland for precision fire systems and for Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).\nIn 2024, international customers accounted for 32% of RMS’ net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis) for which we perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, the Republic of Korea and Australia. We have ongoing combat systems programs associated with different classes of surface combatant ships for customers in Canada, Chile and New Zealand. Our Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC) program will provide surface combatant ships for international customers, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, designed to operate in shallow waters and the open ocean. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany and France. We have active development, production and sustainment support of the S-70 Black Hawk and MH-60 Seahawk helicopters to international customers, including India, Philippines, Australia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Greece. Commercial aircraft are sold to international customers to support search and rescue missions as well as VIP and offshore oil and gas transportation. \nStatus of the F-35 Program\nThe F-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s objective of procuring 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy. We also have commitments from seven international partner countries and twelve FMS customers. We continue to see strong international demand for the F-35, with the Czech Republic signing an LOA in January 2024 to procure 24 F-35s, Singapore announcing in February 2024 its intent to purchase eight additional F-35s, and Greece signing an LOA in July 2024 to procure 20 F-35s. In November 2024, Romania signed an LOA to procure 32 aircraft, becoming the 20th nation to join the F-35 program. We expect international interest to continue to expand in the coming years.\nFrom program inception through December 31, 2024, we have delivered 1,102 production F-35 aircraft, including 797 F-35A variants, 203 F-35B variants and 102 F-35C variants, and our backlog as of that date was 408 aircraft, demonstrating the F-35 program’s continued progress and longevity. We resumed F-35 deliveries in the third quarter of 2024, after delivering none in the first half of the year, and delivered 106 Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) configured aircraft and four TR-2 configured aircraft in 2024. We continue to advance TR-3 and Block 4 capabilities to support our customers’ mission requirements.\nIn December 2024, Lockheed Martin and the Joint Program Office (JPO) reached an agreement for an undefinitized contract action for Lot 18 F-35 Air Vehicle Production Contract for 145 aircraft. The scope includes aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marines and the International Partners and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers, in addition to the required infrastructure for the international Final Assembly and Checkout Facilities (FACOs) and other equipment. While we continue to engage with the U.S. Government to definitize the contract, this agreement allowed us to recognize approximately $700 million of sales and associated operating profit deferred from the third quarter of 2024 into the fourth quarter of 2024. We were also able to invoice and collect cash of approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter for costs incurred. Lot 19 was negotiated concurrently with Lot 18, and both Lots are expected to be fully awarded in 2025.\nThe F-35 program is significant and complex and we and our customers continually review aircraft performance, program and delivery schedule, cost and supply chain issues, and requirements as part of our internal program management efforts and the DoD, Congressional and international countries’ oversight and budgeting processes. Areas of particular focus currently include Lockheed Martin’s and our suppliers’ performance, software maturation related to TR-3 capability and software development more generally, flight test execution, cost of life cycle operations, sustainment, inflation-related cost and supply chain-related cost and schedule pressures, and efforts to increase affordability.\nBacklog\nAt December 31, 2024, our backlog was $176.0 billion compared with $160.6 billion at December 31, 2023. Backlog is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. We expect to recognize approximately 35% \n32\nTable of Contents \nof our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 60% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nOur backlog includes both funded (firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated) amounts. We do not include unexercised options or potential orders under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) agreements in our backlog. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts. Funded backlog was $107.8 billion at December 31, 2024, as compared to $107.4 billion at December 31, 2023. For backlog related to each of our business segments, see below.\nConsolidated Results of Operations \nOur operating cycle is primarily long-term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules. Consequently, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data):\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet sales\n$\n71,043\n \n$\n67,571 \n$\n65,984 \nCost of sales\n(64,113)\n(59,092)\n(57,697)\nGross profit\n6,930\n \n8,479 \n8,287 \nOther income, net\n83\n \n28 \n61 \nOperating profit\n7,013\n \n8,507 \n8,348 \nInterest expense\n(1,036)\n(916)\n(623)\nNon-service FAS pension income (expense)\n62\n \n443 \n(971)\nOther non-operating income (expense), net\n181\n \n64 \n(74)\nEarnings before income taxes\n6,220\n \n8,098 \n6,680 \nIncome tax expense\n(884)\n(1,178)\n(948)\nNet earnings\n$\n5,336\n \n$\n6,920 \n$\n5,732 \nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n22.31\n \n$\n27.55 \n$\n21.66 \nCertain amounts reported in other income, net, including our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in the discussion of our business segment results of operations.\nNet Sales\nWe generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions):\n2024\n2023\n2022\nProducts\n$\n59,277\n \n$\n56,265 \n$\n55,466 \n% of total net sales\n83.4\n \n%\n83.3 \n%\n84.1 \n%\nServices\n11,766\n \n11,306 \n10,518 \n% of total net sales\n16.6\n \n%\n16.7 \n%\n15.9 \n%\nTotal net sales\n$\n71,043\n \n$\n67,571 \n$\n65,984 \nSubstantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, we record net sales on contracts over time based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method.\n33\nTable of Contents \nProduct Sales\nProduct sales increased $3.0 billion, or 5%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher product sales of approximately $1.4 billion at MFC, $1.1 billion at RMS and $840 million at Aeronautics. Higher product sales at MFC were due to production ramp up on GMLRS, HIMARS, JASSM and LRASM programs. Higher product sales at RMS were primarily due to higher volume on radar programs, new program ramp up within the laser systems portfolio and higher production volume on CH-53K program, partially offset by lower volume on the VH-92A program. Higher product sales at Aeronautics were due to higher volume on F-35 production contracts.\nService Sales\nService sales increased $460 million, or 4%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase in service sales was primarily due to higher sales of approximately $305 million at Aeronautics and $150 million at Space. Higher service sales at Aeronautics were due to higher volume on F-35 sustainment contracts. Higher service sales at Space were due to higher volume on national security space services.\nCost of Sales \nCost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales was as follows (in millions):\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCost of sales – products\n$\n(54,852)\n$\n(50,206)\n$\n(49,357)\n% of product sales\n92.5\n \n%\n89.2 \n%\n89.0 \n%\nCost of sales – services\n(10,217)\n(10,027)\n(9,252)\n% of service sales\n86.8\n \n%\n88.7 \n%\n88.0 \n%\nSeverance and other charges\n(87)\n(92)\n(100)\nOther unallocated, net\n1,043\n \n1,233 \n1,012 \nTotal cost of sales\n$\n(64,113)\n$\n(59,092)\n$\n(57,697)\nThe following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. Except for potential impacts to our programs resulting from supply chain disruptions and inflation, we have not identified any additional developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations.\nProduct Costs\nProduct costs increased approximately $4.6 billion, or 9%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher product costs of $2.5 billion at MFC, $1.2 billion at Aeronautics and $1.1 billion at RMS. Higher product costs at MFC were due to $1.4 billion in reach-forward losses on a classified program and production ramp up as described above in “Product Sales”. Higher product costs at Aeronautics were due to higher volume and production ramp up as described above in “Product Sales” and $555 million of losses recognized on a classified contract. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about classified program losses incurred at MFC and Aeronautics. Higher product costs at RMS were due to higher volume and production ramp up as described above in “Product Sales”.\nService Costs\nService costs increased approximately $190 million, or 2%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher service costs of approximately $235 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume as described above in “Service Sales”.\n34\nTable of Contents \nImpairment and Severance Charges\nWe recorded charges totaling $87 million ($69 million, or $0.29 per share, after-tax) in 2024 and $92 million\n (\n$73 million\n, or \n$0.30 per share, after-tax) in 2023. See “Note 16 – Impairment and Severance Charges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Unallocated, Net\nOther unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment (which represents the difference between total CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations and the service cost component of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension income (expense)), stock-based compensation expense, changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities for deferred compensation plans, intangible asset amortization expense and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are not allocated to cost of sales for products or services. Other unallocated, net reduced cost of sales by $1.0 billion in 2024, compared to $1.2 billion in 2023. The decrease in other unallocated, net was primarily due to lower gains from the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to deferred compensation plans in 2024 compared to in 2023 and fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net in 2024 was $83 million, compared to $28 million in 2023. Other income, net primarily includes earnings generated by equity method investees, as well as gains or losses for acquisitions, divestitures, and other items, none of which are individually significant. The increase in other income, net in 2024 resulted primarily from the favorable settlement of an intellectual property related matter and higher earnings generated by equity method investees.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in 2024 was $1.0 billion, compared to $916 million in 2023. The increase in interest expense in 2024 resulted primarily from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in December 2024, January 2024 and May 2023. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within the “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.\nNon-Service FAS Pension Income \nNon-service FAS pension income in 2024 was $62 million, compared to $443 million in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a lower prior service credit amortization and a reduced asset base as detailed in “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Non-operating Income (Expense), Net \nOther non-operating income (expense), net primarily includes gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of early-stage company investments or gains or losses upon the sale of these investments. Other non-operating income, net in 2024 was $181 million, compared to $64 million in 2023. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective income tax rate was 14.2% for 2024 and 14.5% for 2023. The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, \nresearch and development tax credits, \ndividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature and employee equity awards.\n35\nTable of Contents \nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application (including those with retroactive effect), such as the amortization for research and development expenditures, could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders’ equity. In addition to future changes in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans and the change in the amount or reevaluation of uncertain tax positions.\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. In 2024, research and development capitalization resulted in a cash tax liability of approximately $370 million and our net deferred tax assets increased by a similar amount. While the largest impact of this provision was to the 2022 cash tax liability, the impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but will decrease over the period and be immaterial by 2027.\nWe are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities (Australia, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, the United Kingdom, and other countries). The final resolution of tax audits and any related administrative reviews or litigation could result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and changes to the timing of required tax payments, which could affect profitability and cash flows for any particular reporting period. These increases or changes could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in such period.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15% applied on a country-by-country basis for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar 2), with certain aspects of Pillar 2 effective January 1, 2024 and other aspects effective January 1, 2025. While the United States has not enacted legislation to adopt Pillar 2 and it is uncertain if it will do so in the future, certain countries in which we operate have enacted such legislation, and other countries are in the process of doing so. We do not expect Pillar 2 to have a material impact on our effective tax rate or our financial condition and results of operation. \nNet Earnings\nWe reported net earnings of $5.3 billion ($22.31 per share) in 2024 and $6.9 billion ($27.55 per share) in 2023. Net earnings and earnings per share in 2024 were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 12.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2024 compared to 2023. The reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding was a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.\nBusiness Segment Results of Operations\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered.\nNet sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and thus are not included in management’s evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments.\nBusiness segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) or portions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and other items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments.\n36\nTable of Contents \nSales, cost of sales and operating profit for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions): \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet sales\nAeronautics\n$\n28,618\n \n$\n27,474 \n$\n26,987 \nMissiles and Fire Control\n12,682\n \n11,253 \n11,317 \nRotary and Mission Systems\n17,264\n \n16,239 \n16,148 \nSpace\n12,479\n \n12,605 \n11,532 \nTotal net sales\n$\n71,043\n \n$\n67,571 \n$\n65,984 \nCost of sales\nAeronautics\n$\n26,093\n \n$\n24,649 \n$\n24,110 \nMissiles and Fire Control\n12,277\n \n9,712 \n9,676 \nRotary and Mission Systems\n15,391\n \n14,399 \n14,258 \nSpace\n11,308\n \n11,473 \n10,565 \nTotal cost of sales\n$\n65,069\n \n$\n60,233 \n$\n58,609 \nOperating profit\nAeronautics\n$\n2,523\n \n$\n2,825 \n$\n2,867 \nMissiles and Fire Control\n413\n \n1,541 \n1,637 \nRotary and Mission Systems\n1,921\n \n1,865 \n1,906 \nSpace\n1,226\n \n1,158 \n1,057 \nTotal business segment operating profit\n6,083\n \n7,389 \n7,467 \nUnallocated items\nFAS/CAS pension operating adjustment\n1,624\n \n1,660 \n1,709 \nIntangible asset amortization expense\n(247)\n(247)\n(248)\nImpairment and severance charges \n(a)\n(87)\n(92)\n(100)\nOther, net \n(360)\n(203)\n(480)\nTotal unallocated, net\n930\n \n1,118 \n881 \nTotal consolidated operating profit\n$\n7,013\n \n$\n8,507 \n$\n8,348 \n(a)\nSee “Consolidated Results of Operations – Severance and Other Charges” discussion above for information on charges related to certain severance and other actions across our organization.\nOur business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under CAS, which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS pension cost in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated financial statements must present pension and other postretirement benefit plan income calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income (expense) and total CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension income components are included in non-service FAS pension income in our consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds the service cost component of FAS pension income (expense), we have a favorable FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment.\n37\nTable of Contents \nThe total FAS/CAS pension adjustments, including the service and non-service cost components of FAS pension income (expense) for our qualified defined benefit pension plans, were as follows (in millions):\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal FAS income (expense) and CAS cost\nFAS pension income (expense) \n$\n2\n \n$\n378 \n$\n(1,058)\nLess: CAS pension cost\n1,684\n \n1,725 \n1,796 \nTotal FAS/CAS pension adjustment\n$\n1,686\n \n$\n2,103 \n$\n738 \nService and non-service cost reconciliation\nFAS pension service cost\n$\n(60)\n$\n(65)\n$\n(87)\nLess: CAS pension cost\n1,684\n \n1,725 \n1,796 \nTotal FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment\n1,624\n \n1,660 \n1,709 \nNon-service FAS pension income (expense) \n62\n \n443 \n(971)\nTotal FAS/CAS pension adjustment\n$\n1,686\n \n$\n2,103 \n$\n738 \nThe total FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2022 reflects a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax) recognized in connection with the transfer of $4.3 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company in the second quarter of 2022. See “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following segment discussions include information relating to backlog for each segment. Also see “Backlog” discussion above.\nManagement evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.\nWe regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for recovery of our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices.\nWe have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government, and that cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subject to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.\nOur net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.\nMany of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract accounted for under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract, as well as our ability to earn variable consideration. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial \n38\nTable of Contents \ncooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract and variable considerations. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. The profit booking rate may also be adjusted if the total estimated value of the contract changes or there is a contract modification. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. For further discussion on fixed-price contracts,\n see “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChanges in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume, contract mix, and/or performance (referred to as profit booking rate adjustments). Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. Contract mix primarily refers to changes in the ratio of contract type or life cycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production and/or sustainment) and other cost recoveries.\nComparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit booking rate adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit booking rate adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin can be impacted favorably or unfavorably by, for example, certain items listed below, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items include the adverse resolution of contractual matters, supply chain disruptions, restructuring charges (except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results), reserves for disputes, certain asset impairments, and losses on sales of certain assets.\nOur consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments decreased segment operating profit by approximately $180 million in 2024 and increased segment operating profit by $1.6 billion in 2023. The impact in 2024 includes losses of $555 million recognized on a classified program at our Aeronautics business segment, reach-forward losses of $1.4 billion recognized on a classified program at our MFC business segment and $155 million of favorable profit rate adjustments following the resolution of a long-standing claim associated with a completed C-5 Galaxy aircraft contract. The impact in 2023 included an unfavorable profit adjustment of $100 million on the Canadian Maritime Helicopte\nr Program (CMHP)\n and a $65 million favorable profit adjustment as a result of a positive resolution of a contractual matter on an international surveillance and control program at our RMS business segment. See the discussions under “Revenue Recognition” in “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nAeronautics \nOur Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.

Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space’s major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, Global Positioning System (GPS) III, hypersonics and transport layer programs and Next Generation Interceptor (NGI). Operating profit for our Space business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA), which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government and commercial customers.

These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of $255 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume on FBM and reentry programs.\nSpace’s operating profit in 2024 increased $68 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2023. \nThe increase was primarily attributable to $100 million related to favorable contract mix and cost recoveries across the portfolio, partially offset by $55 million of lower profit booking rate adjustments due to lower net favorable profit rate adjustments on the Orion program and $25 million of higher equity earnings driven by higher launch volume from our investment in ULA.\nEquity earnings\nTotal equity earnings (attributable to our investment in ULA) represented approximately $45 million and $20 million, or 4% and 2%, of Space’s operating profit during 2024 and 2023. \nBacklog\nBacklog increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher orders for National Security Space for classified programs, Commercial Civil Space for GeoXO program, and Strategic and Missiles Defense for FBM Mk7 program.\n41\nTable of Contents \nLiquidity and Cash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion that was generally available to fund ordinary business operations without significant legal, regulatory or other restrictions. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash from operations. However, we also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes. This access includes our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper (see “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility or commercial paper at year end for either 2024 or 2023.\nCash received from customers is our primary source of cash from operations. However, from time to time, we fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract or in advance of a contract award, this negatively affects our cash flows, and we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs.\nBilling timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represented approximately 40% of the sales we recorded in 2024, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amounts of performance-based payments and the related milestones are determined in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from the timing of the costs incurred related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows.\nThe U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract and are invoiced regularly as costs are incurred. Our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government changes its payment policies. The U.S. Government from time to time withholds payments on certain of our billings based on contract terms or regulatory provisions. Ultimately, the impact of policy changes or withholding payments may delay the receipt of cash, but the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract should not vary. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated payments to the supply chain with a focus on small and at-risk businesses. We will continue to evaluate the use of accelerated payments on an as needed basis.\nWe seek to maintain a disciplined and dynamic cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities, enhance stockholder value, and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business and technologies through capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments.\nWe continue to return cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. In October 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a fourth quarter dividend payment of $3.30 per share, representing an increase of $0.15 per share over the prior quarterly dividend payment. The Board of Directors also authorized an increase of $3.0 billion to our share repurchase program in October 2024. The remaining authorization under our program was $9.3 billion as of December 31, 2024. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. The amount of shares ultimately purchased and the timing of purchases are at the discretion of management and subject to compliance with applicable law and regulation.\nWe continue to actively manage our debt levels, including maturities and interest rates. We seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.\nWe also actively manage our pension obligations and expect to continue to opportunistically manage our pension liabilities through the purchase of group annuity contracts or other actions for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. See “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Future pension risk transfer transactions could be significant and result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust. The required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and CAS. We could be required to make pension contributions earlier than and/or in excess of what was planned if our return on pension assets is less than our assumptions, which would reduce our free cash flow. We may also make additional contributions at our discretion.\n42\nTable of Contents \nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions): \n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n$\n1,442\n \n$\n2,547 \n$\n3,604 \nOperating activities\nNet earnings\n5,336\n \n6,920 \n5,732 \nNoncash adjustments\n3,300\n \n1,334 \n2,455 \nChanges in working capital\n(294)\n317 \n(733)\nOther, net\n(1,370)\n(651)\n348 \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n6,972\n \n7,920 \n7,802 \nNet cash used for investing activities\n(1,792)\n(1,694)\n(1,789)\nNet cash used for financing activities\n(4,139)\n(7,331)\n(7,070)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n1,041\n \n(1,105)\n(1,057)\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year\n$\n2,483\n \n$\n1,442 \n$\n2,547 \nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $948 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a pension contribution of $990 million. Our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds, were $1.3 billion in 2024, compared to $1.8 billion in 2023.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure - Free Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures are comprised of equipment and facilities infrastructure and information technology (inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software that are capitalized). We use free cash flow to evaluate our business performance and overall liquidity, and is a performance goal in our annual and long-term incentive plans. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it represents the amount of cash generated from operations after reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock repurchases and debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions and other investments. The entire amount of free cash flow is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, because it does not account for certain mandatory expenditures, such as the repayment of maturing debt and future pension contributions. While management believes that free cash flow as a non-GAAP financial measure may be useful in evaluating our financial performance, it should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash from operations\n$\n6,972\n \n$\n7,920 \n$\n7,802 \nCapital expenditures\n(1,685)\n(1,691)\n(1,670)\nFree cash flow\n$\n5,287\n \n$\n6,229 \n$\n6,132 \nFree cash flow decreased $942 million compared to 2023 primarily due to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities described above, partially offset by lower capital expenditures.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows related to investing activities primarily include capital expenditures and payments for acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and investments. The majority of our capital expenditures are for equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also \n43\nTable of Contents \nincur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.\nNet cash used for investing activities increased $98 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $231 million cash payment for the acquisition of Terran Orbital, partially offset by proceeds of $170 million from the sale of our Commercial Engine Solutions (CES) business.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used for financing activities decreased $3.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023.\nWe paid dividends totaling $3.1 billion ($12.75 per share) in 2024 and $3.1 billion ($12.15 per share) in 2023. We paid quarterly dividends of $3.15 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2024 and $3.30 per share during the fourth quarter of 2024; $3.00 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2023 and $3.15 per share during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nDuring 2024, we paid $3.7 billion to repurchase 7.5 million shares of our common stock. See “Note 12 – Stockholders’ Equity” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During 2023, we paid $6.0 billion to repurchase 13.4 million shares of our common stock.\nDuring 2024, we received net proceeds of $3.0 billion from issuance of senior unsecured notes. See “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, we repaid $168 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 8.375% according to their scheduled maturities.\nDuring 2023, we received net proceeds of $2.0 billion from issuance of senior unsecured notes and repaid $115 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.00% according to their scheduled maturities.\nCapital Structure, Resources and Other\nAt December 31, 2024, we held cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion that were generally available to fund ordinary business operations without significant legal, regulatory, or other restrictions.\nOur total outstanding short-term and long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, was $20.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 and is in the form of publicly issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements. \nSee “\nNote 10 – Debt\n”\n \nincluded in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our long-term debt and revolving credit facilities.\nWe actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.\n44\nTable of Contents \nContractual Commitments \nAt December 31, 2024, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Financing lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions):\nTotal\nDue Within\n 1 Year\nTotal debt\n$\n21,558 \n$\n643 \nInterest payments\n17,785 \n990 \nOther liabilities \n2,365 \n479 \nOperating lease obligations\n1,322 \n324 \nPurchase obligations:\nOperating activities\n69,882 \n32,727 \nCapital expenditures\n996 \n619 \nTotal contractual cash obligations\n$\n113,908 \n$\n35,782 \nThe table above includes debt presented gross of any unamortized discounts and issuance costs, but excludes the net unfunded obligation and estimated minimum funding requirements related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. For additional information about obligations and our future minimum contribution requirements for these plans, see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2024. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans. \nPurchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $64.3 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers. \nThe majority of our capital expenditures for 2024 and those planned for 2025 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. The amounts above in the table represent the portion of expected capital expenditures to be incurred in 2025 and beyond that have been obligated under contracts as of December 31, 2024 and not necessarily total capital expenditures for future periods. Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway at Aeronautics to support classified development programs and at RMS to support our Sikorsky helicopter programs; and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.\nWe also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g.\n,\n our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of \n45\nTable of Contents \nventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2024, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $19.1 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments, most of which extend through 2044. To the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligations at December 31, 2024 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the contractual commitments table above. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2024, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.\nWe have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and we have directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. At December 31, 2024, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions): \nTotal \nCommitment\nLess Than\n1 Year\nStandby letters of credit \n(a)\n$\n2,318 \n$\n1,233 \nSurety bonds\n351 \n351 \nThird-party Guarantees\n351 \n231 \nTotal commitments\n$\n3,020 \n$\n1,815 \n(a)\nApproximately $708 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.\nAt December 31, 2024, third-party guarantees totaled $351 million, of which approximately 30% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. These amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.\nIn determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements, all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nContract Accounting / Sales Recognition\nThe majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including FMS contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations in which control transfers continuously to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage of completion cost-to-cost measure of progress.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. We estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. We also estimate variable \n46\nTable of Contents \nconsideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. All of the estimates require significant judgement and are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident, which we refer to as a reach-forward loss.\nComparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters, supply chain disruptions, restructuring charges (except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results), reserves for disputes, certain asset impairments, and losses on sales of certain assets. \nFor the impacts of changes in estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements, see “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Contract Accounting Considerations\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\nWe closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.\nPostretirement Benefit Plans\nOverview\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in a defined contribution retirement savings plan.\nWe continue to take actions to reduce the size of our defined benefit pension plans. From December 2018, through our master retirement trust, we have transferred outstanding defined benefit pension obligations to third party insurance companies; reducing annually required Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to manage our pension liabilities through additional pension risk transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.\nNotwithstanding these actions, the impact of our postretirement benefit plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity, as well as the timing of cash funding.\n47\nTable of Contents \nActuarial Assumptions\nThe benefit obligations and assets of our postretirement benefit plans are measured at the end of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment (including in connection with a pension risk transfer transaction), settlement, or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and participant longevity. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of FAS expense in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions, we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.\nWe continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 5.625% at December 31, 2024, compared to 5.00% at December 31, 2023. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 5.50% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31, 2024, compared to 5.00% at December 31, 2023. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. The increase in the discount rate from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2024.\nWe utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.50% at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the expected and actual return affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance in a particular year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans during 2024 was approximately 1%. This resulted in an actual investment return on the plan assets during year 2024 of $288 million, versus the expected $1.6 billion based on our 6.50% long-term rate of return assumption.\nOur stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $8.3 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. The cumulative noncash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from changes in discount rates, investment experience, and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three-year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over an average period of approximately twenty years as of December 31, 2024. During 2024, $76 million of these amounts, inclusive of amortization of net prior service credit, were recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plan expense.\nThe discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 5.625% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2024, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2024 by approximately $725 million, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $575 million. If the 5.625% discount rate at December 31, 2024 that was used to compute the expected 2025 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2025 would be lower or higher by approximately $5 million. If the 6.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2024 that was used to compute the expected 2025 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2025 would be lower or higher by approximately $55 million. Each year, differences between the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year’s FAS pension expense. Every 100 basis points increase (decrease) in return during 2024 between our actual rate of return \n48\nTable of Contents \nof approximately 1% and our expected long-term rate of return decreased (increased) expected 2025 FAS pension expense by approximately $10 million.\nFunding Considerations\nWe made cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of $990 million in 2024, and no contributions in 2023. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. The funded status under ERISA is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP. Our goal has been to fund each of our qualified defined benefit pension plans to a level of at least 80% as determined in accordance with ERISA; which may require the use of different assumptions, such as the discount rate and longevity, than used under GAAP. All of our qualified defined benefit pension plans had an ERISA funded status of at least 80% as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nContributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS rules govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made in accordance with ERISA.\nWe recovered $1.7 billion in both 2024 and 2023 as CAS pension costs. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. Our prepayment credits were approximately $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving environmental standards.\nWe perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that the liabilities have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which result in the calculation of a range of estimates for each particular environmental remediation site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g.\n,\n a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).\nUnder agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing U.S. Government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.\nAs disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by \n49\nTable of Contents \napproximately $89 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.\nWe cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.\nIf we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs includes values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represents the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program. Intangible assets are amortized over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which typically ranges from three to 20 years.\nOur goodwill balance was $11.1 billion and $10.8 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.\nWe may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.\nTo perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in \n50\nTable of Contents \nworking capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.\nImpairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. Additionally, acquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. This testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units, and the results of those tests indicated no impairment existed. \nFinite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. If the asset group’s carrying amount exceeded the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (under the caption “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”).\n51\nTable of Contents",
