  "item1": "Item 1. Business \nGeneral\nWe are one of the leading cruise companies in the world. We own and operate three global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises (collectively, our \"Global Brands\"). We also own a 50% joint venture interest in TUI Cruises GmbH (\"TUIC\"), which operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\"). We account for our investments in our Partner Brands under the equity method of accounting. Together, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands have a combined fleet of 68 ships in the cruise vacation industry with an aggregate capacity of approximately 166,900 berths as of December 31, 2024. Our ships offer a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on more than 1,000 destinations on all seven continents. \nWe compete principally by operating our portfolio of valued brands that deliver vacation experiences known for exceptional product offerings and service provided by our dedicated crew. Our competitive edge is grounded in our focus on innovation, best evidenced in the quality and variety of ships in our fleet, our growing portfolio of private destinations and experiences, and a range of itineraries and global destinations tailored to meet diverse guest preferences. By continually reimagining vacation possibilities and investing in the maintenance and enhancement of our fleet, we inspire both new travelers and loyal repeat guests to embark on unforgettable journeys with us.\nRoyal Caribbean was founded in 1968 as a partnership. Its corporate structure has evolved over the years and, the current parent corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., was incorporated on July 23, 1985 in the Republic of Liberia under the Business Corporation Act of Liberia.\nOur Global Brands\nOur Global Brands include Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea Cruises. We believe our Global Brands possess the versatility to enter multiple market segments within the vacation industry. Although each of our Global Brands has its own marketing style, as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our Global Brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our Global Brands have historically sourced passengers from similar markets around the world and operated in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, we strategically manage our Global Brands as a single business with the ultimate objective of maximizing long-term shareholder value. \nRoyal Caribbean\nRoyal Caribbean is the world's largest cruise vacation brand. The brand competes in both the contemporary family market and premium segments of the vacation industry appealing to both families with children of all ages and older and younger couples. Royal Caribbean offers vacation experiences that generally feature a casual ambiance, as well as a variety of activities and entertainment venues. We believe that the quality of the Royal Caribbean brand allows it to achieve market coverage that is among the broadest of any of the major cruise brands in the cruise vacation industry. Royal Caribbean's strategy is to attract an array of vacationing guests by offering a wide variety of itineraries to destinations worldwide, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Panama Canal and New Zealand, with cruise lengths generally ranging from three to 14 nights. Royal Caribbean offers multiple innovative options for onboard dining, entertainment and other onboard activities. Because of the brand’s ability to deliver extensive and innovative product offerings at an excellent value to consumers, we believe Royal Caribbean is well positioned to attract new consumers to cruising and to continue to bring loyal repeat guests back for their next vacation.\nRoyal Caribbean operates 28 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 105,400 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, Royal Caribbean had three ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,900 berths. The ships on order include the second Icon-class ship, \nStar of the Seas, \nthe third Icon-class ship, and the seventh Oasis-class ship, which are expected to be delivered in 2025, 2026, and 2028, respectively. In addition, during 2024, we entered into an agreement with Meyer Turku Oy to build a fourth Icon-class ship for delivery in 2027. The agreement is contingent upon completion of certain conditions precedent including financing.\nCelebrity Cruises \nCelebrity Cruises is positioned within the premium segment of the vacation industry. Celebrity Cruises’ strategy is to target consumers by delivering a destination-rich experience on upscale ships that offer, among other things, excellent food and drink, elevated hospitality, world-class spaces and accommodations, and live entertainment. Celebrity Cruises offers a range of itineraries to destinations, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Galapagos Islands, Hawaii, New Zealand, the Panama Canal and South America, with cruise lengths generally ranging from three to 18 nights.\n2\nCelebrity Cruises operates 14 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 35,650 berths. As of December 31, 2024, Celebrity Cruises had one Edge-class ship on order, \nCelebrity Xcel, \nwith an aggregate capacity of approximately 3,250 berths, which is expected to be delivered in 2025. In addition, during 2024, we entered into an agreement with Chantiers de l' Atlantique to build a sixth Edge-class ship for delivery in 2028. The agreement is contingent upon completion of certain conditions precedent including financing.\nSilversea Cruises\nSilversea Cruises is an ultra-luxury and expedition cruise line with smaller ships, high standards of accommodations, fine dining, personalized service and exotic itineraries. Silversea Cruises delivers distinctive destination experiences by visiting unique and remote destinations, including the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica and the Arctic with cruise itineraries generally ranging from six to 25 nights.\nSilversea Cruises operates 12 ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 5,500 berths. \nOur Partner Brands\nOur Global Brands are complemented by our interest in TUIC, our 50%-owned joint venture that operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\").\nTUIC is a joint venture owned 50% by us and 50% by TUI AG, a German tourism company, which is designed to serve the contemporary and premium segments of the German cruise market by offering products tailored for German guests. All onboard activities, services, shore excursions and menu offerings are designed to suit the preferences of this target market. \nTUI Cruises operates seven ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 18,700 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, TUI Cruises had two ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 8,200 berths, which are expected to be delivered in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\nHapag-Lloyd Cruises operates two luxury liners and three smaller expedition ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,590 berths.\nRefer to Note 7.\n Investments and Other Assets\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further details.\nIndustry\nThe cruising industry is a well-established vacation sector in the North American, European and Australian markets and a developing sector in several other emerging markets. We believe that cruising will continue to be a popular vacation choice due to its inherent value, extensive itineraries, private destinations, and variety of shipboard and shoreside activities. Industry data indicates that market penetration rates are increasing but still low and that a significant portion of cruise guests carried are first-time cruisers. Despite the increase in market penetration rates during 2024, we believe there is an opportunity for long-term growth and a potential for increased profitability.\nIndustry market penetration rates (computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population) grew from 3.36% to 3.89% for North America, from 1.25% to 1.41% for Europe, and from 0.08% to 0.20% for Asia/Pacific during the five year period from 2015 through 2019. During 2024, industry market penetration rates were 6.01% for North America, 1.72% for Europe, and 0.09% for Asia/Pacific. The penetration rates in 2024 show the growth potential in the markets most served by the industry. \nThe cruise industry was served by a fleet with a weighted average of approximately 706,000 berths during 2024 with approximately 432 ships at the end of 2024. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 50 ships on order with an estimated 116,500 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market through 2028, not taking into account ships taken out of service or ordered during these periods. The global cruise industry carried approximately 36 million guests in 2024, 32 million cruise guests in 2023 and approximately 20 million in 2022.\n3\nThe following table details the growth in global weighted average berths and the percentage of North American, European and Asia/Pacific cruise guests for 2024, 2023, 2022 and for each of the two years prior to the 2020 suspension of global cruise operations (in millions, except berth data):\nSupply of Berths\nIndustry Cruise Guests\nYear \n(1)\nWeighted-Average\nGlobal Supply\n(2)\nRoyal Caribbean Group\n(3)\nGlobal\n(2)\nNorth American \n(2)(4)\nEurope\n(2)(5)\nAsia/Pacific \n(2)(6)\nOther \n(2)\n2018\n546,000\n135,520\n29\n49%\n26%\n20%\n5%\n2019\n579,000\n141,570\n30\n47%\n25%\n24%\n4%\n2022\n634,000\n150,005\n20\n65%\n29%\n2%\n4%\n2023\n650,000\n157,575\n32\n63%\n27%\n6%\n4%\n2024\n706,000\n163,200\n36\n63%\n26%\n7%\n4%\n___________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nHistorically, we have reported annual information for comparability across periods. The 2020 suspension of global cruise operations and the gradual resumption of full operations starting in the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2022 do not allow for a meaningful comparison to prior years' information and, as such, 2020 and 2021 data has been excluded from this table.\n(2)\nThe estimates of the number of global cruise guests and the weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally are based on a combination of data that we obtain from various publicly available cruise industry trade information sources. We use data obtained from Seatrade Insider, Cruise Industry News and company press releases to estimate weighted-average supply of berths and CLIA and G.P. Wild to estimate cruise guest information. For 2024, we estimate the total number of global cruise guests for the full year with actual data only available through the third quarter. In addition, our estimates incorporate our own analysis utilizing the same publicly available cruise industry data as a base. \n(3)\nTotal berths include our berths related to our Global Brands and Partner Brands as of December 31, 2024.\n(4)\nOur estimates include the United States and Canada.\n(5)\nOur estimates include European countries relevant to the industry (most notably: the Nordics, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). \n(6)\nOur estimates include Southeast Asia (most notably: Singapore and Malaysia), East Asia (most notably: China and Japan), South Asia (most notably: India) and Oceania (most notably: Australia and New Zealand) regions. The decrease in Asia/Pacific cruise guests from 2019 to 2024 is partly driven by lack of cruise supply and itineraries in China through the first half 2023.\nCompetition\nWe compete with a number of cruise lines as well as land-based vacation alternatives for consumers’ leisure time. These include resorts (including all-inclusive resorts), hotels, internet-based alternative lodging sites, theme parks, sports, nature and sightseeing destinations. Our principal cruise competitors are Carnival Corporation & plc, which owns, among other brands, Aida Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Princess Cruises and Seabourn; Disney Cruise Line; MSC Cruises; Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, which owns Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises; Viking, and Virgin Voyages. \nOperating Strategies\nOur mission is to deliver the best vacation experiences responsibly. We continue to prioritize operating strategies that support this mission, working with our various business and community partners as we build toward a more sustainable cruise industry. \nOur Company's operating strategies are as follows:\n•\ndeliver a lifetime of vacations to our customers;\n•\nprotect the health, safety and security of our guests and employees; \n•\ndeepen our customer relationships in order to increase frequency and repeat booking rates; \n4\n•\nprotect the environment and communities in which our vessels and organization operate, with a focus on decarbonization;\n•\ninvest in our workforce in order to better serve our global guest base and grow our business, and nurture a culture that values the contribution of individual talents;\n•\nincrease the awareness and market penetration of our brands globally;\n•\nfocus on cost efficiency, capital allocation and liquidity, with the overall goals of maximizing our return on invested capital and long-term shareholder value; \n•\nstrategically invest in our fleet through the upgrade and maintenance of existing ships and the transfer of key innovations, while prudently expanding our fleet with new state-of-the-art cruise ships;\n•\ncapitalize on the portability and flexibility of our ships by deploying them into those markets and itineraries that provide opportunities to optimize returns, while continuing our focus on existing key markets;\n•\nprovide extraordinary destination experiences and state-of-the-art port facilities to our guests;\n•\ncontinue to deploy technology capabilities and advanced uses of data and analytics to deliver innovative customer experiences as well as to create operational efficiencies; and\n•\nmaintain strong relationships with travel advisors, while enhancing our consumer outreach and e-commerce programs.\nSafety, security and health policies\nWe are committed to protecting the health, safety and security of our guests, employees and others working on our behalf. Our efforts in these areas are managed by several departments within the Company that are responsible for maritime safety, global security, environmental stewardship and medical/public health activities. We also have a dedicated committee of our Board of Directors, the Safety, Environment, Sustainability and Health Committee, which is responsible for reviewing and monitoring our overall strategies, policies and programs that impact the safety and health of our guests and crew.\nConsumer engagement\nWe place a strong focus on delivering a lifetime of vacations and priceless memories for our guests by identifying and creating product features and innovations that our customers value. We are focused on targeting and acquiring high-value guests by better understanding consumer data and insights to create communication strategies that resonate with our target audiences.\nWe target customers at important consumer decision points throughout their vacation journey and identify underlying needs for which guests value and are willing to pay a premium. We continue to invest in various programs and technologies to provide greater value to our customers throughout the vacation planning process - before, during, and after their vacations - and these investments are aimed at increasing revenues and occupancy. We have and expect to strategically invest in experiences on our ships that we believe drive marketability, profitability and improve the guest experience. In addition, we are focused on enhancing our vacation ecosystem by investing in a new travel platform, our loyalty programs and e-commerce capabilities.\nProtect the environment and communities in which we operate\nWe are focused on the health of the environment and communities in which we operate.\n SEA the Future is our commitment to sustain the planet, energize the communities we visit, and accelerate innovation to improve our planet.\n Key programs include our Destination Net Zero strategy and Save the Waves Program.\nDestination Net Zero is our decarbonization strategy that focuses on achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and delivering a net zero capable ship by 2035. This strategy also includes reducing our carbon intensity by double digits by 2025, compared to 2019, which we achieved one year early in 2024. \nDestination Net Zero’s four-pronged approach includes:\n•\nModernizing our fleet with new energy-efficient and alternatively fueled vessels;\n•\nContinued investment in energy efficiency programs;\n5\n•\nDevelopment of alternative fuel and alternative power solutions; and\n•\nOptimized deployment and integration of strategic shore-based supply chains.\n While we continue to refine our roadmap to Destination Net Zero, we know our strategy will require new fuels and technologies that are not available today. Collaboration is imperative to reaching our decarbonization goals. As such, we are partnering with governments, fuel suppliers, shipyards, ship operators, ports, and technology stakeholders to build and test a safe and reliable supply of alternative energy sources.\nAnother example of our commitment to sustaining our planet with key partners is our decades-long Save the Waves program, which focuses on waste management techniques and technologies, along with reuse and recycling programs, to reduce the amount of waste produced on our ships and divert the remaining waste from landfills. We also have a long-term partnership with the World Wildlife Fund to evaluate ship operations, sustainable sourcing of food supplies, waste management, sustainable destinations and guest education on ocean conservation. \nWe also believe in transparent reporting around our corporate responsibility efforts. Our SEA the Future commitment and annual sustainability report, both of which are accessible on our corporate website, highlight our commitment and progress made with regards to those corporate responsibility aspects of our business that we believe are most significant to our organization and stakeholders. In addition to providing an overview on our sustainability efforts, the report references the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative and is aligned with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Boards Industry Standards for Cruise Lines. We continue to advance our reporting following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our corporate website contains the current version of our reports which provide information about our environmental performance goals and sustainability initiatives. The foregoing information contained on our website is not part of any of these reports and is not incorporated by reference herein or in any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Refer to the \nRegulation - Environmental Regulations \nsection below for further information.\nInvesting in our workforce\nWe believe that our employees, both shipboard and shoreside, are a critical success factor for our business. We strive to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain the best employees, who provide our guests with extraordinary vacations. Our Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the Company's human capital management strategies, including initiatives for talent management, and a thriving corporate culture.\nWe focus on providing our employees with a competitive compensation structure, development opportunities, and other personal and professional growth opportunities in order to strengthen and support our human capital. We also select, develop and have strategies to retain high performing leaders to advance the enterprise now and in the future. To that end, we pay special attention to identifying high performing potential leaders and developing bench strength so these leaders can assume leadership roles throughout the organization.\nWe strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces collaboration, motivation and innovation, and believe that maintaining a strong employee-focused culture is beneficial to the growth and expansion of our business. We foster belonging and trust and respect for all among our broad employee base. Refer to the \nHuman Capital\n section below for further information.\nGlobal awareness and market penetration \nWe increase brand awareness and market penetration of our cruise brands in various ways, including the use of communication strategies and marketing campaigns designed to emphasize the qualities of each brand, especially among target groups. Our marketing strategies include the use of travel advisors, traditional media, mobile and digital media as well as social media, influencers, our websites, and sponsorships. Our brands also engage past and potential guests by collaborating with travel partners and through call centers, international offices and international representatives. In addition, our Global Brands target repeat guests with exclusive benefits offered through their respective loyalty programs, which effective June 2024, includes loyalty status match across our brand portfolio. \nWe sell and market our Global Brands to guests outside of the United States and Canada through the combined efforts of internationally focused internal resources and a network of independent international representatives located throughout the world. While the majority of our guests for our Global Brands come from North America, we also sell and market our cruise brands to guests in countries outside of North America by tailoring itineraries and onboard product offerings to the cultural characteristics and preferences of our international guests. In addition, we explore opportunities that may arise to acquire or develop brands tailored to specific markets. \n6\nFocus on cost efficiency, capital allocation, and liquidity\nWe are focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position and a balanced debt maturity profile, while ensuring appropriate leverage, opportunistically reducing interest expense, and maintaining an unsecured balance sheet. During 2024, we achieved investment grade metrics and proactively eliminated all secured and guaranteed debt. We believe these strategies together with our continued focus on increasing operating income and margin, as well as disciplined capital allocation, enhance our ability to achieve our overall goal of maximizing our return on invested capital and long-term shareholder value. \nDelivery of state-of-the-art cruise ships, and fleet upgrade and maintenance\nWe place a strong focus on innovation, which we seek to achieve by introducing new concepts on our new ships and continuously making improvements to our existing fleet, such as large-scale atriums, double hulls for increased safety, and advanced steel structures. We are expanding our innovation efforts to cover multiple fronts, including naval and architectural design, guest facing features, energy efficiency, sustainability, and safety. \nWe are committed to building state-of-the-art ships at a moderate growth rate and we believe our success in this area provides us with a competitive advantage. Our newer vessels traditionally generate higher revenue yield premiums and are more efficient and environmentally friendly to operate than older vessels.\nIn 2023, we introduced three new vessels to our fleet, including Royal Caribbean’s new flagship – \nIcon of the Seas\n, Celebrity Cruises – \nCelebrity Ascent\n, and Silversea Cruises's – \nSilver Nova\n. Both \nIcon of the Seas \nand \nSilver Nova\n are the first vessels of a new class. For Royal Caribbean, new features on \nIcon of the Seas \ninclude a dedicated family neighborhood called “Surfside”, a pool deck featuring the largest swimming pool and waterpark at sea, and the “Aquadome” showcasing the tallest waterfall at sea in an 82-foot-tall dome. For Celebrity Cruises, \nCelebrity Ascent\n represents an evolution of \nCelebrity Beyond\n and builds on the innovation that the Edge series of ships have brought to market. For Silversea, \nSilver Nova\n is amongst our most environmentally friendly and energy efficient ships to date. In 2024, Royal Caribbean introduced \nUtopia of the Seas, \nand Silversea Cruises introduced \nSilver Ray. \nEach of these ships represent the evolution of their class and the latest ships for each brand. \n As of December 31, 2024, our Global Brands and Partner Brands have six ships on order. Refer to the \nOperations \nsection below for further information on our ships on order. As we further develop our Newbuild program, we continue to utilize each vessel as an opportunity to pilot new technology towards Destination Net Zero.\n In addition, we regularly evaluate opportunities to order new ships, purchase existing ships or sell ships in our current fleet while ensuring that we remain focused on the returns we generate on invested capital and maintaining a high level of discipline on capital spending and operating leverage.\nMarkets and itineraries\nIn an effort to penetrate untapped markets, diversify our consumer base and respond to changing economic and geopolitical market conditions, we continue to seek opportunities to deploy ships to new and stronger markets and itineraries throughout the world. The portability of our ships allows us to deploy our ships to meet demand within our existing and new cruise markets. We make deployment decisions generally 18 to 32 months in advance, with the goal of optimizing the overall profitability of our portfolio. Additionally, the infrastructure investments we have made to create a flexible global sourcing model have made our brands relevant in a number of markets around the world, which allows us to be opportunistic and source the highest yielding guests for our itineraries.\nOur ships offer a wide selection of itineraries that call on over 1,000 destinations in over 120 countries, spanning across all seven continents. We are focused on maximizing long-term shareholder returns by operating in established markets while growing our presence in developing markets. New capacity has allowed our brands to expand into new markets and itineraries in an effort to address changes in market demand.\nDestination experiences and port facilities\nIn order to provide unique destination experiences to our guests, we have and continue to invest in our private land destinations. Our Perfect Day Collection represents our initiative to develop a series of private destinations in key markets. The first island in the collection, Perfect Day at CocoCay, includes a wide range of attractions, such as a full water park, zip line course, freshwater pools, helium balloon ride, splash pads and a beach club. In January 2024, we completed an expansion of Perfect Day at CocoCay with the delivery of Hideaway Beach, an adults-only experience. In October 2024, we announced the second destination in our Perfect Day Collection, Perfect Day Mexico, a Mexican inspired Royal Caribbean destination experience expected to open in 2027, and will serve our Western Caribbean itineraries from \n7\nhomeports in Texas and Florida. Additionally, our Royal Beach Club collection will offer an exclusive and branded experience at high volume ports. The first Royal Beach Club is expected to open in 2025 in Nassau, Bahamas; and the second Royal Beach Club expected to open in 2026, in Cozumel, Mexico. In October 2024, we also announced Silversea's plans to develop a hotel in Puerto Williams, Chile to provide a further-elevated and seamless guest experience for its Antarctica expeditions. We continue to evaluate opportunities to develop additional destinations across the globe.\nIn an effort to secure desirable berthing facilities for our ships, and to provide new or enhanced cruise destinations for our guests, we have actively assisted or invested in the development or enhancement of certain port facilities and infrastructure, including mixed-use commercial properties, located in strategic ports of call, and reduction of our environmental impacts. For instance, through our partnership agreement with iCON Infrastructure Partners VI, L.P. (\"iCON\"), we own, develop, and manage cruise terminal facilities and infrastructure in key ports of call, initially including several development projects in Italy and Spain.\nGenerally, we partner with local, private or governmental entities by collaborating on strategic investments and destination management. Our participation in these efforts is most often accomplished via investments with the relevant government authority and/or various other strategic partnerships established to develop and/or operate the port facilities, by providing direct development and management expertise or in certain limited circumstances, by providing direct or indirect investments. In exchange for our involvement, we generally secure preferential berthing rights for our ships. \nTechnological capabilities \nTechnology is a pervasive part of virtually every business process we use to support our operating strategies and provide a quality experience to our customers before, during and after their vacation. We continue to develop tools that enhance our commercial capabilities and support our goal of deepening our customer relationships. We are focused on enhancing our guests' digital experience and growing onboard revenue, by making it easier for our guests to plan and maximize their next vacation through our websites and mobile applications. For example, we recently enabled booking a cruise in our mobile applications, built a loyalty hub to provide easy to view status, benefits and ways to earn rewards and a video library to showcase our family of brands.\nWe have continued to expand digital capabilities into our operations and have increased our focus in bringing data analytics and artificial intelligence into our processes to provide better insights for revenue management as well as in how to model our maintenance or operational actions. Our entire fleet is equipped with Starlink through our partnership with SpaceX, bringing the next generation in shipboard connectivity and unlocking an improved guest experience. In concert with our destination focus, our island technology solutions are now enabling our guests to remain connected with WiFi access, charge food and beverages, and take advantage of all the island based activities with the same ease as onboard our ships.\nInvestments in our core platforms, as well as the trade and direct distribution channels, are delivering the benefit of more modernized solutions with scalability and faster self-service response times while also deploying new features and additional promotional offer capabilities. Cyber security and data privacy are an ongoing focus, and we have made and will continue to make investments to protect our customer data, intellectual property and global operations. Refer to Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n - “\nWe are exposed to cyber security attacks and data breaches and the risks and costs associated with protecting our systems and maintaining data integrity and security” \nfor a discussion of the risks associated with cyber security. \nTravel advisor relationships, consumer outreach, and e-commerce \nTravel advisors continue to be a significant sourcing channel of revenues for our ships. We believe in the value of this distribution channel and invest in maintaining strong relationships with our travel partners. To accomplish this goal, we seek to maintain competitive commission rates and incentive structures with the marketplace. We continuously work with travel advisors to sell upgrades and add-ons such as air and pre-cruise purchases to improve the retention and profitability of the channel. We provide brand dedicated sales representatives who serve as consultants to our travel partners. We also provide trained customer service representatives, call centers and online training tools. \nWe continue to operate our Consumer Outreach department, which provides consumers 24-hour access to our vacation planners and customer service agents in our call centers, as well as invest in our websites, including mobile applications and mobile websites. We enable our guests to communicate and book with us through various channels such as phone, web, chat, text message, and/or email. Additionally, we continue to advance our e-commerce capabilities and the vacation shopping experience for our guests. In addition to offering a simplified booking experience, we leverage the mobile application for onboard experiences such as WiFi, beverages, shore excursions, and specialty dining – enabling guests to book their vacation end-to-end.\n8\nGuest Services\nWe handle virtually all travel aspects related to guest reservations and transportation, including facilitating guest pre- and post-hotel stay arrangements and air transportation. \nRoyal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises offer recognition and cruise benefits to their guests through their loyalty programs, Crown & Anchor Society, Captain’s Club, and Venetian Society, respectively, to encourage repeat business. These loyalty programs collectively have over 26 million enrolled members worldwide. Members are awarded points or credits in proportion to their number of cruise days and stateroom category. The loyalty programs provide tiers of membership benefits which entitle guests to upgraded experiences and recognition relative to the status achieved once guests have accumulated the number of cruise points or credits specified for each tier. In addition, the Crown & Anchor Society, Captain’s Club and Venetian Society members all benefit from our loyalty status match program, effective June 2024, where membership in one program qualifies for the equivalent tier in each of the sister brands. Examples of the benefits available under our loyalty programs include, but are not limited to, priority waitlist for shore excursions, complimentary laundry service, complimentary internet, digital discount vouchers, upgraded bathroom amenities, reserved seating in entertainment venues, ship tours and, in the case of our most loyal guests who have achieved the highest levels of cruise points or credits, complimentary cruises.

The expected delivery dates for all of our ships on order are subject to change due to events such as shipyard construction delays or agreed upon scope changes which impact the delivery timelines. See Part I. Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n for further discussion on shipyard operations.\nShip\nShipyard\nExpected Delivery\nApproximate\nBerths\nRoyal Caribbean —\n \n \nOasis-class:\n \n \nUnnamed\nChantiers de l’Atlantique\n2nd Quarter 2028\n5,700\nIcon-class:\nStar of the Seas\nMeyer Turku Oy\n3rd Quarter 2025\n5,600\nUnnamed\nMeyer Turku Oy\n2nd Quarter 2026\n5,600\nCelebrity Cruises —\nEdge-class:\nCelebrity Xcel\nChantiers de l’Atlantique\n4th Quarter 2025\n3,250\nTUI Cruises (50% joint venture) —\n \n \nMein Schiff Relax\nFincantieri\n1st Quarter 2025\n4,100\nMein Schiff Flow\nFincantieri\n2nd Quarter 2026\n4,100\nTotal Berths\n28,350\n__________________________________________________________________\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, we received commitments for the unsecured financing of the seventh Oasis-class ship for up to 80% of the ship’s contract price and our building contract with Chantiers de l’Atlantique became effective. Bpifrance Assurance Export, the official French export credit agency, has agreed to guarantee to the lenders 100% of the financing.\nIn addition, during 2024, we entered into an agreement with Meyer Turku Oy and Chantiers de l' Atlantique to build a fourth Icon-class ship for delivery in 2027 and a sixth Edge-class ship for delivery in 2028. The agreements are contingent upon completion of certain conditions precedent including financing.\nIn January 2025, we announced the launch of Celebrity River Cruises, a premium river cruise vacation. We entered into agreements for the commitment to an initial order of 10 ships with plans to sail in 2027.\nSeasonality\nOur revenues have historically been seasonal based on the demand for cruises. Demand is typically strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have \n11\nfocused on deployment in the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period.\nPassengers and Capacity\nSelected statistical information is shown in the following table (see \nFinancial Presentation \n- \nDescription of Certain Line Items\n and \nSelected Operational and Financial Metrics\n under Item 7. \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, for definitions). \nPassengers Carried, Passenger Cruise Days, Available Passenger Cruise Days\n and\n Occupancy\n reflect the impact of our suspension of operations during parts of 2020 and 2021 and the gradual resumption of full operations starting the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021 (1)(3)\n2020 (2)\nPassengers Carried\n8,564,272\n7,646,203\n5,536,335\n1,030,403\n1,295,144\nPassenger Cruise Days\n54,844,780\n49,549,127\n35,051,935\n5,802,582\n8,697,893\nAvailable Passenger Cruise Days (APCD)\n50,552,731\n46,916,259\n41,197,650\n11,767,441\n8,539,903\nOccupancy\n108.5%\n105.6%\n85.1%\n49.3%\n101.9%\n___________________________________________________________________\n(1)    Due to the elimination of the Silversea Cruises three-month reporting lag in October of 2021, we include Silversea Cruises' metrics from October 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 and October 1 through December 31, 2021 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The year ended December 31, 2021 does not include July, August, and September 2021 statistics as Silversea Cruises' results of operations for those months are included within \nOther (expense) income\n in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n(2)          Due to the three-month reporting lag effective through September 30, 2021, we include Silversea Cruises' metrics from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020 in the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(3)    For the year ended December, 31, 2021, we include Azamara Cruises' metrics through March 19, 2021, the effective sale date of the brand. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we include the full year of operations for Azamara Cruises.\nCruise Pricing\nOur cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities, including meals and entertainment. Prices vary depending on many factors including the destination, cruise length, stateroom category selected, the time of year the cruise takes place, and the amenities bundled into the price. \nAlthough we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the United States, our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior to sailing. Our cruises are generally available for sale at least one year in advance and often more than two years in advance of sailing. During the selling period of a cruise, we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand, with the objective of maximizing net yields. \nAs our business has grown globally, our sale arrangements with travel advisors may vary. For instance, although our direct business has historically grown at a rapid pace, sale arrangements through travel advisor charter and group sales are proportionately higher in the China market than in our other markets which are primarily through retail agency and direct sales. We have developed and implemented enhancements to our reservations system that provide us and our travel partners with additional capabilities, making it easier to do business with us.\nPassenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 70%, 69% and 66% of total revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOnboard Activities and Other Revenues\nOur cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services, amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship. While many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise, we realize additional revenues from, among other things, gaming, the sale of alcoholic and other beverages, internet and other telecommunication services, gift shop items, shore excursions, photography, spa/salon and fitness services, art auctions, retail shops and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options. Many of these services are available for pre-booking prior to embarkation. These onboard activities are offered either directly by us or by independent concessionaires from which we receive a percentage of their revenues. The all-inclusive pricing programs that we offer currently add some of these onboard activity and other services to the base price of the cruise. \n12\nIn conjunction with our cruise vacations, we offer pre- and post-cruise hotel and tour packages to our Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises guests. We also offer cruise vacation protection coverage to guests in a number of markets, which provides guests with coverage for trip cancellation, medical protection and baggage protection. Onboard and other revenues accounted for approximately 30%, 31%, and 34% of total revenues in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nSegment Reporting\nWe believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our Global Brands have historically sourced passengers from similar markets around the world and operated in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics, types of consumers, regulatory environment, maintenance requirements, supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided. Our President and Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker (\"CODM\"), and is responsible for carrying out the functions of allocating resources and assessing performance. The CODM uses Operating Income (loss) to assess performance and allocate resources. This financial metric is used by the CODM to review operating trends, and to monitor budget-to-actual variances in order to make key operating decisions. \n(\nRefer to Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data, \nfor\n \nfinancial information.)\nHuman Capital\nOur human capital strategy focuses on attracting, developing and retaining the best talent in the industry. Some key elements of these strategies include: current and future talent needs assessments; a thriving culture that values the contribution of individual talents, skills and ideas; robust opportunities for employee growth and development; support for health and well-being; and an active listening strategy to make sure voices are heard and continuous improvement occurs. We review our human capital strategy with the Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors on a regular basis.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our three global cruise brands employed approximately 106,000 employees spanning across our shipboard fleet and shoreside locations. Our shoreside workforce, including private destinations, consisted of approximately 10,800 full time and 50 part-time employees. Our shipboard workforce consisted of approximately, 95,150 employees, and as of December 31, 2024, approximately 88% were covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nThe following table details the distribution of our workforce by employee type and region as of December 31, 2024:\nEmployee Type\nU.S. Based Employees \nInternational Employees \nShoreside Operations\n(1)\n4,250\n4,850\nShipboard Employees\n—\n95,150\nPrivate Destinations\n (2)\n \n—\n1,750\n(1)    Includes full time and part-time employees. \n(2)    Private Destinations includes Coco Cay, Labadee and Galapagos based employees.\nAs a global operation, we take great pride in the broad diversity of our workforce and the value it brings to our company. Females represent 56% of our global shoreside workforce. Our shipboard workforce is comprised of employees from approximately 145 countries. The majority of our shipboard workforce comes from the Philippines (33%), Indonesia (17%) and India (15%). Our shoreside workforce is primarily based out of the U.S. (47%), Philippines (34%), Mexico (6%), and U.K. (4%).\n13\nThe following table details the gender distribution of our workforce by employee location as of December 31, 2024:\nEmployee Location \nMale \nFemale \nShoreside - U.S. \n46%\n54%\nShoreside - International \n41%\n59%\nShipboard \n79%\n21%\nOur U.S. shoreside workforce is ethnically diverse as shown in the following table: \nU.S. Shoreside Representation by Ethnicity \n% of Total U.S. Shoreside Population \nWhite \n37%\nHispanic \n44%\nAfrican American \n8%\nAsian \n6%\nOthers\n(1)\n5%\n(1)    No other individual category is greater than 1%.\nWe offer a variety of learning and development programs to our workforce, which includes a combination of instructor led (classroom and virtual) and web based (self-learning) courses. This includes additional tools to assist our employees with managing their career development within Royal Caribbean Group. In 2024, our workforce invested approximately 3.2 million hours in learning programs across a variety of areas ranging from Ethics, Compliance, Business Software and Tools, Finance/Accounting, Professional development, Project Management, Cyber Security, Leadership and Safety/Security among others. In total, our workforce completed approximately 4.1 million courses within our learning management systems.\nWe run our employee pulse surveys periodically to understand and positively impact our employees’ experience. In 2024, our shoreside employee engagement scores remained high and above most global industry benchmarks.\nTrademarks\nWe own a number of registered trademarks related to the Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises cruise brands. The registered trademarks include the name “Royal Caribbean” and its crown and anchor logo, the name “Celebrity Cruises” and its “X” logo, the name “Silversea Cruises” and its logo, and the names of various cruise ships, ship venues, private destinations, and other marketing programs. We believe our largest brands' trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\nInsurance \nWe maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, with insured values generally equal to the net book value of each ship. This coverage is maintained with reputable insurance underwriters from the British, Scandinavian, French, United States and other reputable international insurance markets.\nWe are members of four Protection and Indemnity (\"P&I\") clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 12 P&I clubs, known as the International Group of P&I Clubs (the “IG”). Liabilities, costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew and guest, pollution and other third-party claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our P&I clubs, subject to the clubs’ rules and the limits of coverage determined by the IG. P&I coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 12 P&I clubs, whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the IG are exhausted. We are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers.\nWe maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew, guests and other third parties as well as for loss or damage to our vessels arising from acts of war, including invasion, insurrection, terrorism, rebellion, piracy and hijacking. Our primary war risk coverage is provided by a Norwegian war risk insurance association and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our four P&I clubs. Consistent with most marine war risk policies, our coverage is subject to cancellation in \n14\nthe event of a change in risk. In the event of a war between major powers, our primary policies terminate after thirty days’ notice and our excess policies terminate immediately. Our excess policies are also subject to cancellation after a notice period of seven days in the event of other changes in risk. These notice periods allow for premiums to be renegotiated based on changes in risk.\nInsurance coverage for other exposures, such as shoreside property and casualty, passenger off-vessel, directors and officers and network security and privacy, are maintained with various global insurance companies.\nWe do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place, as compared to the cost of insurance.\nAll insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations, exclusions and deductible levels. In addition, in certain circumstances, we either self-insure or co-insure a portion of these risks. Premiums charged by insurance carriers, including carriers in the maritime insurance industry, increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature. These cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets. We historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable. No assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future, particularly for war risk insurance. Refer to Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n - “\nThe potential unavailability of insurance coverage, an inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or our failure to have coverage in sufficient amounts to cover our incurred losses may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations” \nfor a discussion of the risks associated with insurance coverage.\nRegulation \nOur ships are regulated by various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate. In addition, our ships are registered in the Bahamas, Cyprus, Malta or in the case of our ships operating in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry, including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships, guests and crew as well as environmental protection. Each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below. Ships operating out of ports of call around the world are also subject to inspection by the maritime authorities of that country for compliance with international treaties and local regulations. Additionally, ships operating out of the United States ports are subject to inspection by the United States Coast Guard for compliance with international treaties and by the United States Public Health Service for sanitary and health conditions. Our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit. \nWe believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business. Health, safety, security, environmental and financial responsibility issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the United States and internationally. From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes may be implemented that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future.\nSafety and Security Regulations\nOur ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”), which, among other things, establish requirements for ship design, structural features, materials, construction, lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships for guest and crew safety. The SOLAS standards are revised from time to time and incorporated in our ship design and operation, as applicable. The latest enhancements include the addition of the Polar Code which sets goal-based standards for ships operating in the polar region as well as damage stability requirements for new designs and operational measures for existing vessels. Compliance with these modified standards have not historically had a material effect on our operating costs. SOLAS incorporates the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for all vessels, including passenger vessel operators. \nAll of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities, and we are required to maintain the relevant certificates of compliance with the ISM Code.\nAdditionally, we are required to meet, and we fully comply with, the provisions outlined in the Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). This convention sets the training and competency standards for all our crew who are responsible for operating the vessels or who have designated roles in ensuring the safety of our guests and crew during an emergency. Regulatory bodies routinely check that our crews’ training credentials are up-to-date and \n15\nassess competency by observing safety and emergency drills. As amendments are made to STCW, we ensure that our crew training is updated accordingly.\nOur ships are subject to various security requirements, including the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (“ISPS Code”), which is part of SOLAS, and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”), which applies to ships that operate in U.S. ports. In order to satisfy these security requirements, we implement security measures, conduct vessel security assessments, and develop security plans. The security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the Recognized Security Organization on behalf of the ships' flag state and are in compliance with the ISPS Code and the MTSA. \nThe Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010, which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the United States, requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime. The cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various international, regional, and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection governing air emissions, water and waste management among others. Under such laws and regulations, we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste and treated effluents into the waterways, while also reducing our emissions. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. From time to time, environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations, which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs. We believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and, accordingly, may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future, including the items described below.\nOur ships are subject to the International Maritime Organization’s (‘‘IMO’’) regulations under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the ‘‘MARPOL Regulations’’) and the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (Ballast Water Management Convention), in addition to other regional and national regulations such as EU Directives and the US Vessel General Permit, which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil, sewage, garbage, air emissions and the transfer of non-native/non-indigenous species. We have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil, sewage, air pollution prevention and ballast water for all of our ships. \nInternational Regulations:\nSulfur Emissions\nThe MARPOL Regulations imposed reduced global limitations on the sulfur content of emissions emitted by ships operating worldwide to 0.5% as of January 1, 2020. The MARPOL Regulations also establish special Emission Control Areas (\"ECAs\") with additional stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in certain geographical areas. There are four established ECAs, one additional ECA being established beginning in May of 2025 and two more in March 2026 that restrict sulfur emissions: the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, certain waters surrounding the North American coast, and the waters surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the \"US Caribbean ECA\"), the Mediterranean Sea ECA coming into force in May 2025 and the Norwegian Sea and Canadian Arctic ECA coming into force as early as March 2026. Ships operating in these sulfur ECAs are required to reduce their emissions sulfur content to 0.1%.\n Compliance with the MARPOL sulfur regulations has not and is not expected to have a material impact to our results of operations, largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years. This includes equipping all of our new ships delivered since 2014 with Advanced Emissions Purification (\"AEP\") systems covering all engines and actively developing and installing AEP systems on the majority of our remaining fleet; resulting in 72% of our fleet being equipped with AEP systems. In addition, the majority of our ships on order are being delivered with Liquified Natural Gas (\"LNG\") technology that meet all sulfur requirements without the need for an AEP system. These efforts will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility. \nNitrogen Oxides Emissions\nThe MARPOL Regulations also impose limitations on Nitrogen Oxides. All new ships operating within the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECA that began construction on or after January 1, 2016 and ships operating in the North and Baltic Sea ECA constructed on or after January 1, 2021 are required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits. In order to ensure deployment flexibility, all of our ships under construction are being built to comply with \n16\nthese nitrogen oxide emission rules. Compliance with these MARPOL requirements has not had and is not expected to have, a material impact on our results of operations due to the mitigating steps described above. \nGreenhouse Gas (\"GHG\") Emissions\nIn 2019, the IMO implemented regulations that require ships to monitor and report their carbon emissions called IMO's Data Collection System (\"DCS\"). The DCS contemplated the enactment of further obligations and restrictions focused on reducing carbon emissions from ships.\nIn January 2023, the IMO amendments to the MARPOL convention went into effect combining a technical and an operational measure (Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (\"EEXI\") and Carbon Intensity Indicator (\"CII\")). These regulations aim to reduce international shipping carbon intensity in line with the ambition of the initial IMO GHG Strategy of 40% by 2030, as compared to 2008. Compliance with the EEXI has not had a material impact on our operations. The impact of CII is still uncertain as the IMO is expected to review the CII framework in 2026, which could result in requirements that could lead to changes to our itinerary flexibility for some of our ships depending on the final operational measures needed to comply. \nFurthermore, the IMO in 2023 revised its initial GHG Strategy to include check points in 2030 and 2040 to seek reductions in absolute GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 20% and 70%, respectively, compared to 2008. The revised IMO strategy also considers various other measures, obligations and restrictions to further reduce carbon emissions from ships. These include a possible fuel standard and a global market-based measure, such as a fuel levy or carbon taxes, with the intent to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the exact impact is uncertain at this time as the proposals have yet to be finalized, the global nature of the CII regulation and various other potential measures within the IMO's revised strategy could have a material impact on our results of operations due to increased compliance costs.\nBallast Water\nThe IMO Ballast Water Management Convention, which came into effect in 2017, requires ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing Ballast Water Treatment Systems. The convention also sets requirements for record keeping and maintaining an approved Ballast Water Management Plan. Compliance with this regulation has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations,\nEuropean Union Regulations:\nThe European Union (EU) continues to propose and adopt environmental regulations aimed at improving or maintaining environmental standards in the union. One major focus of these regulations is around greenhouse gases. In 2018, the EU adopted the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification regulations which mandated the reporting of emissions data from all ships over 5,000 gross tons. In 2022, the EU proposed a series of carbon reforms under its Fit for 55 package designed to meet its 2030 emission goals of reducing its GHG emissions by 55% from 1990 levels. As part of this package, during 2023, the EU adopted and published the Emission Trading System (ETS) and the FuelEU Maritime regulation. The ETS program imposes requirements to purchase carbon emission allowances beginning in 2024 for 40% of our emissions within Europe, growing to 70% of emissions in 2025, and to 100% of emissions in 2026 and annually thereafter. The EU ETS regulation did not have a material impact on our 2024 results of operations. The impact of the regulation on future periods is uncertain as the costs of ETS allowances will depend on future markets and future deployments. Based on current deployment plans and current prices of ETS allowances, we do not expect the regulation to have a material impact on our 2025 and 2026 results of operations.\nThe FuelEU Maritime regulation will require ships to reduce GHG intensity in the fuels they consume by 2% as of 2025, and gradually reduce the intensity to 80% by 2050, compared to the 2020 average. All passenger ships will additionally be obligated to connect to shore power when at berth in a Trans-European Transport Network (\"TEN-T\") port by 2030 and all EU ports by 2035. When fully implemented, the FuelEU Maritime and the remaining Fit for 55 proposals could individually and collectively have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to increased costs associated with compliance and modified itineraries in the affected regions.\nUS. Federal and State Regulations:\nThe Clean Water Act (“CWA”) provides the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) with the authority to regulate incidental discharges from commercial vessels. Through the establishment of the Vessel General Permit (\"VGP\") in 2013, the EPA mandated standards for many of these discharges such as ballast water, bilge water, gray water, anti-fouling and more. The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (VIDA), which will eventually replace the VGP, was signed into law in 2018 to help clarify and streamline discharge requirements for all states for the incidental discharges covered by the VGP and certain U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”) regulations for ballast water. The VIDA requires the EPA to develop new \n17\nnational standards of performance for incidental discharge and the USCG will then have two years to develop and implement enforcement regulations. On September 2024, the EPA finalized the national standards of performance for incidental discharges. The exact impacts of these standards on our vessels are uncertain as the USCG has yet to develop the corresponding implementing regulations to enforce compliance. However, the new standards could expand applicability of vessel discharges from 3 to 12 nautical miles which could have impacts on our environmental operations and increase reporting requirements. In the interim, we continue to be subject to the VGP’s requirements for discharges incidental to the normal operations of our vessels.\nRefer to Item 1A. \nRisk Factors - \"Factors associated with climate change, including an increasing global regulatory focus, could adversely affect our business\", and \"Labor, health and safety, financial responsibility, maritime and other regulations and measures could affect operations and increase operating costs\" \nfor further discussion of the risks associated with the regulations discussed above\n. \nConsumer Financial Responsibility Regulations \nWe are required to obtain certificates from the United States Federal Maritime Commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of non-performance of obligations to guests, as well as casualty and personal injury. As a condition to obtaining the required certificates, we generally arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our ship-operating companies. The required amount of the surety bonds for non-performance of obligations to guests is currently $32 million per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments. \nWe are also required by the United Kingdom, Norway, Finland, Iceland and the Baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the non-performance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom we are currently required by the Association of British Travel Agents to provide performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year, up to £162 million during the peak season. Additionally, we are required by the Civil Aviation Authority to provide performance bonds totaling £25 million. We maintain with the Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in Norway, Finland, Iceland and the Baltics.\nCertain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the non-performance of our obligations; however, the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs. \nTaxation of the Company\nThe following is a summary of our principal taxes, exemptions and special regimes. In addition to or instead of income taxation, virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee, or both, based on guest headcount, tonnage or some other measure. We also collect and remit value added tax (VAT) or sales tax in many jurisdictions where we operate.\nOur consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation. \nU.S. Income Taxation \nThe following is a discussion of the application of the U.S. federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Department regulations, administrative rulings, court decisions and the relevant state tax laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations. All of the foregoing is subject to change, and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion.\nApplication of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises, Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and many of our ship-owning subsidiaries, depending upon the itineraries of their ships, generate income from sources within the United States. Certain of our subsidiaries, including our United Ki\nngdom tonnage tax\n company are classified as disregarded entities, or divisions for U.S. federal income tax purposes that may earn U.S. source income. Under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income (and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits) U.S. source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships, including income from the leasing of such ships. \nA foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part: (1) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States; and (2) the stock of the corporation (or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof) is “primarily and regularly traded on an \n18\nestablished securities market” in the United States. In the opinion of our U.S. tax counsel, Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, based upon and subject to the representations, assumptions, legal authorities and limitations set forth in that opinion, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., Silversea Cruises Ltd., and relevant ship-owning subsidiaries with U.S. source shipping income qualify for the benefits of Section 883 because Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in Liberia, which is a qualifying country, and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States (i.e., we are a “publicly traded” corporation). If, in the future, (1) Liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction, and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption, or (2) we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation, we and all of our ship-owning or operating subsidiaries that rely on Section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their U.S. source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto. \nWe believe that most of our income and the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries, is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and, therefore, is exempt from taxation under Section 883. \nRegulations under Section 883 list activities that are not considered by the Internal Revenue Service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation, shore excursions and pre- and post-cruise tours. Our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the United States will be subject to U.S. taxation.\nTaxation in the Absence of an Exemption Under Section 883 \nIf Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the operator of our vessels, Celebrity Cruises Inc., Silversea Cruises Ltd., or our ship-owning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, or if the provision was repealed, then, as explained below, such companies would be subject to U.S. income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships.\nBecause Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Celebrity Cruises Inc., and Silversea Cruises Ltd., conduct a trade or business in the United States, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., and Silversea Cruises Ltd., would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income (i.e., without regard to the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries) on income which is effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business (generally only income from U.S. sources). In addition, if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business were withdrawn, or were deemed to have been withdrawn, from our U.S. trade or business, those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30%. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., and Silversea Cruises Ltd., would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30%.\nIf Section 883 were not available to our ship-owning subsidiaries, each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4% tax on its U.S. source gross transportation income, if any, each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the United States and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship.\nOther United States Taxation\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., and Silversea Cruises Ltd., earn U.S. source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping. The tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented. \nState Taxation\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., Silversea Cruises Ltd., and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various U.S. state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the U.S. source income subject to federal income taxes. Additionally, the state of Alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in Alaska and certain other affiliated companies to Alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33% tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in Alaska waters. This did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented.\nUnited Kingdom Income Taxation\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we operated 16 ships under the United Kingdom tonnage tax regime (“U.K. tonnage tax”).\nCompanies subject to U.K. tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels. The requirements for a company to qualify for the U.K. tonnage tax regime include being subject to U.K. corporate income tax, operating qualifying ships, which are strategically and commercially managed in the United Kingdom, and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement.\n19\nRelevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities. Our U.K. income from non-shipping activities which do not qualify under the U.K. tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant, remain subject to regular U.K. corporate income tax. \nGlobal Minimum Tax\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued Pillar Two model rules (\"Global Minimum Tax\") introducing a new global minimum tax of 15% \nwith certain aspects of Pillar Two effective January 1, 2024 and other aspects effective January 1, 2025\n. The UK and EU member countries have agreed to adopt these provisions and many countries implemented these rules for 2024. Our parent company is incorporated in Liberia. Liberia has not announced plans to revise its local corporate income tax laws as part of the Pillar Two proposal. The OECD model rules provide an exclusion for “International Shipping Income,” and certain ancillary income, for which certain of our earnings may be eligible.\nThe Pillar Two rules became effective for a portion of our earnings in 2024 and will also be effective for a portion of our earnings in 2025. These changes did not have a material impact on our 2024 results of operations, and we believe the impact for 2025 will be immaterial. These rules will apply to a majority of our earnings starting in 2026. We have developed mitigation strategies that we believe we can execute to minimize the impact of these provisions to an immaterial amount. However, we continue to evaluate our mitigation options given the evolving nature of the proposed and enacted legislative changes Refer to Item 1A. \nRisk Factors - \"A change in our tax status under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or other jurisdictions, may have adverse effects on our results of operations.\"\nOther \nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to value-added and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable, zero-rated or exempt. \nWebsite Access to Reports\nWe make available, free of charge, access to our Annual Reports, all quarterly and current reports and all amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission and through our website at \nwww.rclinvestor.com\n.

Furthermore, they are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in those forward-looking statements. Examples of these risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, in particular, the risks discussed under the caption \"Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A herein.\nAll forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K speak only as of the date of this filing. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \nOverview\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is organized to present the following:\n•\na review of our critical accounting policies and estimates and of our financial presentation, including discussion of certain operational and financial metrics we utilize to assist us in managing our business;\n•\na discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023; and\n•\na discussion of our liquidity and capital resources, including our future capital and material cash requirements and potential funding sources.\nA discussion of our results of operations, and sources and uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 is included in Part II. Item 7. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n of our \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 202\n3\n, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024 and is incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\n28\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). (Refer to Note 1\n. General\n and Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n). Certain of our accounting policies are deemed \"critical,\" as they require management's highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. We have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. We believe our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows:\nShip Accounting\nShips represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 10%-15% projected residual value, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally 30-35 years. The 30-35 year useful life and 10%-15% residual value is the weighted-average of all major components of a ship. Our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes, environmental regulations, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. In addition, we take into consideration our estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships' major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins. We employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values, as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. Given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. We do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems. However, we estimate the costs, useful lives and residual values of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives, as well as our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry. We do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems, but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished. Improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements' estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship. The estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized within \nCruise operating expenses \nin our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nWe periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness, considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships the planned level of improvements to maintain, enhance, and to comply with environmental regulations for vessels within those classes. In the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships, a review of the estimate is completed. \nWe use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. Under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock, which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel's age as required by Class. Deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification. Class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. The activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and, as such, are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity. The significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility, hull inspection and related activities (e.g., scraping, pressure cleaning, bottom painting), maintenance to steering propulsion, thruster equipment and ballast tanks, port services such as tugs, pilotage and line handling, and freight associated with these items. We perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain Class. The costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel's designed and intended operating capability. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred.\nWe use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks, which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs. If the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock, the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written-off to the gain or loss on disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place. We also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred. \nWe believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes. However, should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower. If circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship \n29\nimprovements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year, depreciation expense for 2024 would have increased by approximately $166 million. If our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for 2024 would have increased by approximately $452 million. We have evaluated our estimated ship useful lives and projected residual values in light of our current environment and determined that there are no changes to these estimates. Refer to Note 6\n. Property and Equipment\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n for further information on our ships\n.\nValuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, and if necessary, a goodwill impairment test. Factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nThe goodwill impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. We typically estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. The estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues, operating costs, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, interest rates, and assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry's competitive environment and general economic and business conditions, among other factors. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2024 impairment assessment consisted of:\n•\nForecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day;\n•\nOccupancy rates from existing vessels;\n•\nVessel operating expenses;\n•\nTerminal growth rate; and\n•\nWeighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).\nThe discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base. We discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weighted average cost of capital.\nIf the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no write-down of goodwill is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets, an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit. Refer to Note 4\n. Goodwill\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further information on goodwill.\nThe impairment review for indefinite-lived intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment. The quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of these assets using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset, such as the relief-from-royalty method, for trademarks and trade names. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2024 impairment assessment consisted of:\n•\nForecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day;\n•\nOccupancy rates from existing vessels;\n•\nTerminal growth rate;\n•\nRoyalty rate; and\n•\nWeighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).\nIf the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered impaired. Other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Refer to Note 5.\n Intangible Assets\n to \n30\nour consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further information on indefinite-life and finite-life intangible assets.\nWe review our ships and other long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, based on recent and projected cash flow performance and remaining useful lives, that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships. If estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value. Refer to Note 6\n. Property and Equipment \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further information on determination of fair value for long-lived assets. \nWe estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If active markets are not available, we base fair value on independent appraisals, sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk. Quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinite-life intangible assets. Accordingly, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite-life intangible asset using an expected present value technique.\nRoyal Caribbean Reporting Unit\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed a qualitative analysis as part of our annual impairment review of the Royal Caribbean reporting unit. Based on our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the Royal Caribbean reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus, we did not proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit's fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative analysis as part of our annual impairment review of the Royal Caribbean reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As a result of the quantitative test, we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 100%, resulting in no impairment to Royal Caribbean's goodwill. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our Royal Caribbean reporting unit was $296 million.\nWe did not perform interim impairment evaluations of Royal Caribbean's goodwill during \n2024\n and 2023, as no triggering events were identified.\nSilversea Cruises Reporting Unit\nDuring the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2023, we performed a quantitative analysis as part of our annual impairment review of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit. As of November 30, 2024, and November 30, 2023, the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit was determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As a result of the tests, we determined the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 63%, as of November 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill attributable to our Silversea Cruises reporting unit was $509 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nDuring the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2023, we performed our annual impairment reviews of the Silversea Cruises trade name. As a result of the quantitative tests, we determined that the fair value of the Silversea Cruises' trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 66% and 62%, as of November 30, 2024 and November 30, 2023, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' tr\nade name. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and \n2023\n, the carrying value of indefinite-life intangible assets was $321 million, which primarily relates to the Silversea Cruises trade name. \nWe did not perform interim impairment evaluations of Silversea Cruises' goodwill or trade names during \n2024\n and 2023, as no triggering events were identified.\n31\nDerivative Instruments\nWe enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. We also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments. Although some of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance. Refer to Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n and Note 16.\n Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor more information on related authoritative guidance, the Company's hedging programs and derivative financial instruments.\nOn a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options with third-party institutions in over-the-counter markets. We estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments' contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We value floors which are embedded within our interest rate swaps using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options’ contract terms, such as exercise price and maturity, and readily available market data, such as forward interest rates and interest rate volatility. We apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments.\nWe estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps' contract terms and forward prices. We derive forward prices from published forward fuel curves which in turn are based on actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets. We apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments. We also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties.\nWe adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk.\nWe believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions, inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience.\nContingencies—Litigation\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made. \nSeasonality\nOur revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises. Demand has historically been strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere's summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have historically focused on deployment to the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period. \nFinancial Presentation\nDescription of Certain Line Items\nRevenues\nOur revenues are comprised of the following:\n•\nPassenger ticket revenues\n, which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships; and\n32\n•\nOnboard and other revenues\n, which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods and/or services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices, casino operations, cancellation fees, sales of vacation protection insurance, pre- and post-cruise tours and fees for operating certain port facilities. \nOnboard and other revenues\n also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods and/or services onboard our ships, as well as revenues received for procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates.\nCruise Operating Expenses\nOur cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following:\n•\nCommissions, transportation and other expenses\n, which consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues, including travel advisor commissions, air and other transportation expenses, port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees;\n•\nOnboard and other expenses\n, which consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues, including the costs of products sold onboard our ships, vacation protection insurance premiums, costs associated with pre- and post-cruise tours and related credit card fees, as well as the minimal costs associated with concession revenues, as the costs are mostly incurred by third-party concessionaires and costs incurred for the procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates;\n•\nPayroll and related expenses\n, which consist of costs for shipboard personnel (costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in \nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses\n);\n•\nFood expenses\n, which include food costs for both guests and crew;\n•\nFuel expenses\n, which include fuel and related delivery, storage and emission consumable costs and the financial impact of fuel swap agreements; and\n•\nOther operating expenses\n, which consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance, port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts, vessel related insurance, entertainment and gains and/or losses related to the sale of our ships, if any. \nWe do not allocate payroll and related expenses, food expenses, fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience.\nSelected Operational and Financial Metrics\nWe utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition. As discussed in more detail herein, certain of these metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided along with the related GAAP financial measures as we believe they provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA (as defined below) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful whe\nn assessing our profitability on a comparative basis. For the p\neriods presented, these items included (i) Other (income) expense, which includes the 2024 release of the loss contingency recorded in 2022 in connection with the Havana Docks litigation inclusive of related legal fees and costs; (ii) impa\nirment and credit losses\n; (iii) \nequity investment impairment, recovery of losses and other;\n (iv) restru\ncturing charges and other initiatives expense; and (v) \ngain on sale of controlling interest\n. A reconciliation of \nNet Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n to Adjusted EBITDA is provided below under Results of Operations. \nAdjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share (\"Adjusted EPS\") \nis a non-GAAP measure that\n \nrepresents Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis.\n33\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n represents Gross Margin, adjusted for payroll and related, food, fuel, other operating, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Gross Margin is calculated pursuant to GAAP as total revenues less total cruise operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n \nis a non-GAAP measure that \nrepresents net income (loss) less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. For the periods presented, these items included \n(i) loss on extinguishment of debt; (ii) litigation loss contingency, which includes the 2024 release of the loss contingency recorded in 2022 in connection with the Havana Docks litigation inclusive of related legal fees and costs; (iii) impairment and credit losses; (iv) equity investment impairment, recovery of losses and other; (v) restructuring charges and other initiatives expense; (vi) the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from the Silversea Cruises acquisition in 2018; (vii) tax on the sale of PortMiami noncontrolling interest; (viii) \nSilver Whisper\n deferred tax liability release; and (ix) gain on sale of controlling interest. A reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) \nattributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. \nto Adjusted Net Income (Loss) \nattributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. \nis provided below under Results of Operations.\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss)\n is a non-GAAP measure that represents operating income (loss) including income (loss) from equity investments and income taxes but excluding (i) impairment and credit losses; (ii) equity investment impairment, recovery of losses and other; (iii) restructuring charges and other initiatives expense; (iv) the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from the Silversea Cruises acquisition in 2018; and (v) tax on the sale of PortMiami noncontrolling interest. We use this non-GAAP measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below). A reconciliation of Operating Income to Adjusted Operating \nIncome \nis provided below under Results of Operations.\nAvailable Passenger Cruise Days\n (\"\nAPCD\n\") is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary.\nConstant Currency\n is a significant measure for our revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, the value of these revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollar will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses, it can be an important element. For this reason, we also monitor our revenues and expenses in \"Constant Currency\" - i.e., as if the current period's currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior perio\nd's rates. For the 2024 period presented, w\ne calculate \"Constant Currency\" by applying the average for 2023 period exchange rates for each of the corresponding months, so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates been the same throughout both periods. We do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods. It should be emphasized that the use of Constant Currency is primarily used by us for comparing short-term changes and/or projections. Over the longer term, changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currency-based fluctuations.\nEBITDA \nis a non-GAAP measure that represents Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax benefit or expense. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis. A reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to EBITDA is provided below under Results of Operations.\nGross Cruise Costs \nrepresent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses.\nGross Margin Yield \nrepresent Gross Margin per APCD.\nInvested Capital\n represents the most recent five-quarter average of total debt (i.e., Current portion of long-term debt plus Long-term debt) plus the most recent five-quarter average of Total shareholders' equity. We use this measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below).\nNet Cruise Costs \nand \nNet C\nruise Costs \nexcluding\n Fuel\n are non-GAAP measures that represent Gross Cruise Costs excluding commissions, transportation and other expenses, onboard and other expenses and, in the case of Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel, fuel expenses (each of which is described above under the Description of Certain Line Items heading). In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our cost performance. For the periods presented, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel excludes (i) impairment and credit losses; (ii) restructuring charges and other \n34\ninitiatives expense; and (iii) the gain on sale of controlling interests. \nA reconciliation of Gross Cruise Costs to Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel is provided below under Results of Operations.\nNet Yields\n represent Adjusted Gross Margin per APCD. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin and Net Yields to manage our business on a day-to-day basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs, which are commissions, transportation and other expenses, and onboard and other expenses.\nOccupancy (\"Load factor\")\n, in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days (as defined below) by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100% indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins.\nPassenger Cruise Days (\"PCD\")\n represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises.\nReturn on Invested Capital\n (\"ROIC\") represents Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) divided by Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.\nTrifecta\n refers to the multi-year Adjusted EBITDA per APCD, Adjusted EPS and ROIC goals we publicly announced in November 2022. We designed these goals to help us better execute and achieve our business goals by clearly articulating longer-term financial objectives. Under Trifecta, we are targeting Adjusted EBITDA per APCD of at least $100, Adjusted EPS of at least $10, and ROIC of 13% or higher by the end of 2025. On July 25, 2024, we announced the company achieved all three of its Trifecta goals 18 months ahead of schedule, on a trailing twelve-month basis.\nThe use of certain significant non-GAAP measures, such as Net Yields, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel, allows us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard GAAP based financial measures. There are no specific rules or regulations for determining non-GAAP measures, and as such, they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry. \n35\nExecutive Overview\n2024 performance was exceptionally strong and significantly exceeded our expectations. \nWe took delivery of two new ships (\nUtopia of the Seas\n and \nSilver Ray\n), announced the expansion of our private destination portfolio with Royal Beach Club Cozumel and Perfect Day Mexico, and reinstated a dividend to our shareholders. We achieved strong financial performance, including 23.8% Gross Margin Yield growth as-reported, Net Yields increased 11.5% as-reported (11.6% in Constant-Currency), Net Income of $2.9 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $6.0 billion, Operating Income of 4.1 billion, and ROIC of 16.1%. As announced on July 25, 2024, we also achieved our Trifecta goals 18 months ahead of schedule. In addition, we made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet, refinancing approximately $6.1 billion of high cost debt, eliminating restrictions on our ability to return capital to shareholders, and eliminating all security and guarantees. \nOur 2024 Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was $2.9 billion, or $10.94 per diluted share, compared to Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $1.7 billion, or $6.31 per diluted share in 2023. Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. for 2024 was $3.2 billion, or $11.80 per diluted share, compared to Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $1.8 billion, or $6.77 per diluted share in 2023.\nTotal revenues in 2024 were $16.5 billion compared to $13.9 billion in 2023 driven by strong ticket revenue and onboard revenue performance, inclusive of capacity growth. As a result of this, Gross Margin Yields increased 23.8% as-reported, and Net Yields increased 11.5% as-reported (11.6% in Constant-Currency), both compared to 2023. The strength in revenue and improved cash flow, combined with our margin expansion efforts allowed us to accelerate debt repayment, improving our debt maturity profile and strengthening our balance sheet.\nCruise operating expenses increased from $7.8 billion in 2023 to $8.7 billion in 2024. Gross Cruise Costs per APCD increased 4.6% as-reported and 4.6% in Constant Currency, compared to 2023. Net Cruise Costs, excluding Fuel, per APCD increased 6.8% as-reported and 6.8% in Constant Currency, compared to 2023, primarily driven by a record 22 ships in drydock in 2024, as well as higher incentive based, non-cash compensation expense.\nIn 2025, we expect our capacity to increase by 5.4% compared to 2024, with the addition of\n Star of the Seas\n in late summer and \nCelebrity Xcel\n in late 2025, and a full year of operations for \nUtopia of the Seas\n and\n Silver Ray\n. In addition, the first Royal Beach Club, at Paradise Island in the Bahamas, is set to open towards the end of the year, and \nWonder of the Seas\n will join \nUtopia of the Seas\n focused on short Caribbean itineraries. We also expect to advance development of the Royal Beach Club Cozumel, Perfect Day Mexico, and Silversea’s new hotel in Puerto Williams, Chile that will provide a further-elevated and seamless guest experience for its Antarctica expeditions. Our new ships, optimized deployment, continued load factor growth and enhanced onboard offerings are expected to drive growth in Net Yields and Total Revenues.\n36\nResults of Operations\nIn addition to the items discussed above under \"Executive Overview,\" significant items for 2024 include:\n•\nNet Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion, or $10.94 and $11.80 per share on a diluted basis, respectively, compared to Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, or $6.31 and $6.77 per share on a diluted basis, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n•\nTotal revenues increased by $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.

Capacity was up 7.8% in 2024, driven by the additions of our newest ships \nUtopia of the Seas,\n \nIcon of the Seas,\n \nSilver Ray, \nas well as a full year of operations from \nCelebrity Ascent \nand \nSilver Nova.\nPassenger ticket revenues\n comprised 69.8% of our 2024 total revenues. \nPassenger ticket revenues \nincreased\n \nby $1.9 billion, or 20.2% to $11.5 billion in 2024 from $9.6 billion in 2023. \nThe increase was primarily due to:\n•\na 7.8% increase in capacity due to the new ships noted above, an increase in ticket prices on a per passenger basis, and a \n2.9%\n increase in occupancy.\n•\na $1.2 billion\n increase driven by higher ticket prices and occupancy in 2024, and\n a $0.7 billion increase driven by capacity.\nThe remaining 30.2% of total revenues was comprised of \nOnboard and other revenues\n, which increased $0.7 billion, or 15.1% to $5.0 billion in 2024 from $4.3 billion in 2023. The increase was due to:\n•\na $336 million increase driven by a 7.8% increase in capacity due to the additions of new ships noted above in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\n•\na $318 million increase driven by improved pricing and an increase in occupancy of 2.9% in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nCruise operating expenses \nTotal \nCruise operating expenses\n increased by $0.9 billion, or 11.3%, to $8.7 billion in 2024 from $7.8 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to:\n•\nthe 7.8% increase in capacity noted above which increased cruise operating expenses by $603 million; and \n•\nan increase of $300 million driven by various factors including an increase in higher drydock and maintenance related expenses; and commissions due to the increases in ticket prices noted above in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses\n increased $333 million, or 18.6% to $2.1 billion in 2024 from $1.8 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense driven by an increase in headcount and higher stock price related to our performance share awards in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, and higher spending on advertisement and media promotions.\nOther income (expense)\nInterest expense, net of interest capitalized \nfor 2024\n \nincreased\n \n$188 million, to $(1.6) billion from $(1.4) billion in 2023. The increase was due to loss on extinguishment of debt of $344 million primarily associated with the full redemption of our 11.625%, 9.250%, 8.250%, and 7.25% Senior Notes, and $119 million inducement expense on the partial settlement of our 2025 Convertible notes in 2024 compared to loss on extinguishment of debt of $121 million during the same period in 2023. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $146 million lower interest expense in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, resulting from the 2024 refinancings.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses \nfor 2024 increased $145 million, or 10.0%, to $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to the additions of \nIcon of the Seas, Utopia of the Seas,\n and \nSilver Ray \ncompared to the addition of \nCelebrity Ascent \nand\n Silver Nova \nduring\n \nthe second half of 2023.\nEquity investment income\n for 2024 was $260 million compared to $200 million in 2023. The increase in income was primarily due to income from TUI Cruises, one of our equity method investments, in 2024 compared to 2023.\n44\nOther income (expense)\n increased $111 million, to other income in 2024, from other expense of $(8) million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to the release of the loss contingency of \n$124 million\n recorded in 2022 in connection with the Havana Docks litigation.\n45\nFuture Application of Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n for further information on \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\n \nNet cash provided by operating activities \nincreased by $0.8 billion to $5.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to cash provided of $4.5 billion for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nNet cash used in investing activities \ndecreased by\n \n$0.5 billion to $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to cash used of $3.9 billion for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $0.5 billion was primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures associated with taking delivery of \nIcon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent, and\n \nSilver Nova \nin 2023 compared to \nUtopia of the Seas \nand\n Silver Ray \nin 2024.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities \nwas $(1.9) billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to cash used of $(2.0) billion for the same period in 2023. The change of $0.1 billion was primarily attributable to an increase in debt repayments of $2.1 billion, an increase in premiums on repayments of debt of $0.2 billion, an increase of $0.1 billion related to our return to payment of dividends in 2024, and proceeds of $0.2 billion for the sale of noncontrolling interest of PortMiami, which did not recur in 2024. The change was offset by an increase of $2.7 billion related to debt proceeds in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. \nFuture Capital Commitments\nCapital Expenditures\nOur future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders. As of December 31, 2024, we have two Icon-class ships and one Oasis-class ship on order for our Royal Caribbean brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 16,900 berths. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we have one Edge-class ship on order for our Celebrity Cruises brand, with a capacity of approximately 3,250 berths. Refer to Item 1. \nBusiness-Operations\n for further information on our ships on order. We have committed financing arrangements in place covering approximately 80% of the cost of the ship for the four ships on order for our Global Brands, all of which include sovereign financing guarantees.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, excluding any ships on order by our Partner Brands, was approximately $7.8 billion, of which we had deposited $815 million. Approximately 43.4% of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 16.\n Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments \nand Note 17.\n Commitments and Contingencies\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we anticipate overall full year capital expenditures, based on our existing ships on order, will be approximately $5 billion for 2025. This amount does not include any ships on order by our Partner Brands.\n46\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2024, our material cash requirements were as follows (in millions): \n \nPayments due by period\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotal\nOperating Activities:\n \n \n \n \n \nInterest on debt\n(1)\n$\n954 \n$\n890 \n$\n753 \n$\n581 \n$\n477 \n$\n1,630 \n$\n5,285 \nOther\n(2)\n178 \n188 \n167 \n124 \n118 \n797 \n1,572 \nInvesting Activities:\nShip purchase obligations\n(3)\n2,421 \n1,689 \n141 \n1,427 \n— \n— \n5,678 \nTotal\n$\n3,553 \n$\n2,767 \n$\n1,061 \n$\n2,132 \n$\n595 \n$\n2,427 \n$\n12,535 \n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1)    Long-term debt obligations mature at various dates through fiscal year 2037 and bear interest at fixed and variable rates. Interest on variable-rate debt is calculated based on forecasted debt balances, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, using the applicable rate at December 31, 2024. Debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at December 31, 2024.\n(2)    Amounts primarily represent future commitments with remaining terms in excess of one year to pay for our usage of certain port facilities, marine consumables, services and maintenance contracts.\n(3)     Amounts are based on contractual installment and delivery dates for our ships on order. Included in these figures are $4.9 billion in final contractual installments, which have committed financing covering approximately 80% of the cost of the ships on order for our Global Brands, all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. Amounts do not include potential obligations which remain subject to cancellation at our sole discretion or any agreements entered for ships on order that remain contingent upon completion of conditions precedent.\nRefer to Note 8\n. Debt \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor maturities related to debt.\nRefer to Note 9\n. Leases \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor maturities related to lease liabilities.\nRefer to \nFunding Needs and Sources\n below for discussion on the planned funding of the above material contractual obligations. \nAs a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, pricing and our overall growth strategy, we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships. We may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships. We continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these were to occur, they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n.\nRefer to Note 8\n. Debt \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor export credit agency guarantees.\nRefer to Note 7.\n Investments and Other Assets \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor ownership restrictions related to TUI Cruises.\nRefer to Note 17.\n Commitments and Contingencies \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor other agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2024, other than the items described above, we are not party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities, that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial position.\n47\nFunding Needs and Sources\nWe have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $5.9 billion of committed financing for our ships on order. As of December 31, 2024, our obligations due through December 31, 2025 primarily consisted of $1.6 billion related to debt maturities, $1.0 billion related to interest on debt and $2.4 billion related to progress payments on our ship orders and, based on expected delivery date, the final installments payable due upon the delivery of \nStar\n \nof the Seas \nand \nCelebrity Xcel\n. We have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, draw-downs under our available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional debt and/or the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund our obligations. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had liquidity of $4.1 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $0.4 billion and $3.7 billion of undrawn revolving credit facility capacity. Refer to Note 8\n. Debt \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further information.\nIf any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period, we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, which we may be unable to replace on similar terms. Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. If this were to occur, it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations.\nBased on our assumptions and estimates and our financial condition, we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. However, there is no assurance that our assumptions and estimates are accurate as there is inherent uncertainty in our ability to predict future liquidity requirements. \nDebt Covenants\nOur export credit facilities and our non-export credit facilities, and certain of our credit card processing agreements contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio, limit our net debt-to-capital ratio, and to maintain a minimum liquidity. In July 2024, we amended all of our export credit facilities to eliminate the contractual requirement for us to maintain a minimum level of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants and we estimate that we will be in compliance for at least the next twelve months. \nDividends\nThe declaration of dividends shall at all times be subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors that a dividend is prudent at that time in consideration of the needs of the business. In December 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.55 per share, which was paid in January 2025. During the third quarter of 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share, which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nIn February 2025, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.75 per share, payable in April 2025.\n48",
