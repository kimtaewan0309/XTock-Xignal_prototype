For over 70 years, we have been innovating ways to predict, prevent, detect, and treat animal illness, and continue to stand by those raising and caring for animals worldwide - from veterinarians and pet owners to livestock producers. \nWe manage our operations through two geographic operating segments: the United States (U.S.) and International. Within each of these operating segments, we offer a diversified product portfolio for both companion animal and livestock customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements — \nNote 16. Segment Information\n. \nWe directly market our products to veterinarians and livestock producers located in approximately 45 countries across North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and South America, and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate. Through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets, such as Brazil, Chile, China and Mexico, we believe we are one of the largest animal health medicines and vaccines businesses as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole. In markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products. \nOur companion animal and livestock products are primarily available by prescription through a veterinarian. On a more limited basis, in certain markets, we sell certain products through retail and e-commerce outlets. We also market our products by advertising to veterinarians, pet owners and livestock producers.\nWe believe our investments in one of the industry’s largest sales organizations, including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists, our high-quality manufacturing and reliability of supply, and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs, has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers. Our research and development (R&D) efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so that they remain relevant for our customers.\nWe have approximately 300 product lines that we sell in over 100 countries for the prediction, prevention, detection and treatment of diseases and conditions that affect various companion animal and livestock species. The diversity of our product portfolio and our global operations provides stability to our overall business. \nA summary of our 2025 performance compared with the comparable 2024 periods follows:\n% Change \nThree Months Ended\nRelated to\nSeptember 30,\nForeign\n(MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)\n2025\n2024\nTotal\nExchange\nOperational\n(a)\nRevenue\n$\n2,400\n \n$\n2,388 \n1 \n1 \n— \nNet income attributable to Zoetis\n721\n \n682 \n6 \n1 \n5 \nAdjusted net income\n(a)\n754\n \n716 \n5 \n— \n5 \n% Change \nNine Months Ended\nRelated to\nSeptember 30,\nForeign\n(MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)\n2025\n2024\nTotal\nExchange\nOperational\n(a)\nRevenue\n$\n7,080\n \n$\n6,939 \n2 \n(1)\n3 \nNet income attributable to Zoetis\n2,070\n \n1,905 \n9 \n3 \n6 \nAdjusted net income\n(a)\n2,199\n \n2,061 \n7 \n3 \n4 \n(a)\n    Operational results and adjusted net income are non-GAAP financial measures. See the \nNon-GAAP financial measures\n section of this Management\n’\ns Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) for more information.\nOur operating environment \nFor a description of our operating environment, including factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results, see \"Our Operating Environment\" in the MD&A of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Set forth below are updates to certain of the factors disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nQuarterly Variability of Financial Results \nOur quarterly financial results are subject to variability related to a number of factors including, but not limited to: tariffs and other trade protection measures, the decline in global macroeconomic conditions, competitive dynamics, geopolitical tensions with and economic uncertainty in certain markets, inflation, global supply chain disruption, variability in distributor inventory stocking levels as a result of expected demand and promotional activities, weather patterns, herd management decisions, regulatory actions, disease outbreaks, product and geographic mix, timing of price increases and timing of investment decisions. \nTariffs and Trade Protection Measures\n \nOur business is subject to risks related to, among other factors, tariffs and other trade protection measures put in the place by the United States or other countries, as well as U.S. international trade relations, including those with China, Canada and the European Union. Starting in early 2025, the \n22\n |\nTable of Contents\nUnited States government announced additional tariffs on certain goods imported into the U.S. from numerous countries and multiple nations countered with reciprocal tariffs and other actions in response. While the final tariffs and other measures to be imposed, and their applicability to our business, remain uncertain, such actions may negatively impact demand and result in an increase in some product costs. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and evaluate actions that can be taken to moderate and/or minimize its effects. For further information regarding the impact of potential additional tariffs and trade protection measures on the Company, see\n Part II., Item 1A, Risk Factors\n in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nDisease Outbreaks \nSales of our livestock products have in the past, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals. Outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of such products, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, which may reduce demand for our products. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Alternatively, sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase.\nForeign Exchange Rates \nSignificant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Our products are sold in more than 100 countries and, as a result, our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, approximately 41% of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenue in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro and other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact our revenue, cost of goods and expenses, and consequently, net income. Exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations. These fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, approximately 59% of our total revenue was in U.S. dollars. Our year-over-year total revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1% from changes in foreign currency values relative to the U.S. dollar. For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect at the balance sheet date, with translation adjustments recorded in \nOther (income)/deductions––net\n, and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nWe report information in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Management also measures performance using non-GAAP financial measures that may exclude certain amounts from the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors and may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. We present certain identified non-GAAP measures solely to provide investors with useful information to more fully understand how management assesses performance. \nOperational Results\nWe believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings results, but also “operational” results. Operational results is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as revenue or earnings results excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This measure provide information on the change in revenue and earnings as if foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the current and prior periods to facilitate a period-to-period comparison. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides a useful comparison to previous periods for the company and investors, but should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP reported results. \nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share\nAdjusted net income and the corresponding adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures of performance used by management. We believe these financial measures are useful supplemental information to investors when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures. We report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations, and the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of our products, prior to considering certain income statement elements. We define adjusted net income and adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Zoetis and EPS before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition and divestiture-related costs and certain significant items. \nWe recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to these metrics. A limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, divestiture or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. The adjusted net income and adjusted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP reported net income attributable to Zoetis and reported EPS. See the \nAdjusted Net Income\n section below for more information.\n23\n |\nAnalysis of the condensed consolidated statements of income \nThe following discussion and analysis of our statements of income should be read along with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in \nPart I— Item 1\n of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n%\nSeptember 30,\n%\n(MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)\n2025\n2024\nChange\n2025\n2024\nChange\nRevenue\n$\n2,400\n \n$\n2,388 \n1 \n$\n7,080\n \n$\n6,939 \n2 \nCosts and expenses:\nCost of sales\n683\n \n701 \n(3)\n1,954\n \n2,012 \n(3)\n% of revenue\n28.5\n \n%\n29.4 \n%\n27.6\n \n%\n29.0 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n579\n \n565 \n2 \n1,759\n \n1,693 \n4 \n% of revenue\n24\n \n%\n24 \n%\n25\n \n%\n24 \n%\nResearch and development expenses\n170\n \n167 \n2 \n499\n \n500 \n— \n% of revenue\n7\n \n%\n7 \n%\n7\n \n%\n7 \n%\nAmortization of intangible assets\n32\n \n35 \n(9)\n97\n \n107 \n(9)\nRestructuring charges and certain acquisition and divestiture-related costs\n4\n \n5 \n(20)\n34\n \n51 \n(33)\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest\n58\n \n57 \n2 \n165\n \n174 \n(5)\nOther (income)/deductions—net\n(13)\n(16)\n(19)\n(27)\n1 \n*\nIncome before provision for taxes on income\n887\n \n874 \n1 \n2,599\n \n2,401 \n8 \n% of revenue\n37\n \n%\n37 \n%\n37\n \n%\n35 \n%\nProvision for taxes on income\n166\n \n182 \n(9)\n529\n \n486 \n9 \nEffective tax rate\n18.7\n \n%\n20.8 \n%\n20.4\n \n%\n20.2 \n%\nNet income before allocation to noncontrolling interests\n721\n \n692 \n4 \n2,070\n \n1,915 \n8 \nLess: Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n—\n \n10 \n*\n—\n \n10 \n*\nNet income attributable to Zoetis\n$\n721\n \n$\n682 \n6 \n$\n2,070\n \n$\n1,905 \n9 \n% of revenue\n30\n \n%\n29 \n%\n29\n \n%\n27 \n%\n*Calculation not meaningful\nRevenue\nThree months ended September 30, 2025 vs. three months ended September 30, 2024\nTotal revenue increased by $12 million, or 1%, in the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Other R&D-related costs associated with non-U.S. market and regulatory activities are generally included in the International segment.\nThree months ended September 30, 2025 vs. three months ended September 30, 2024\nOther business activities net loss increased by $3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase in certain compensation-related costs and depreciation expense, partially offset by a decrease in R&D costs primarily due to timing of spend related to projects and other strategic investments.\nNine months ended September 30, 2025 vs. nine months ended September 30, 2024\nOther business activities net loss decreased by $8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a decrease in R&D costs primarily due to timing of spend related to projects and other strategic investments, as well as contract manufacturing results, partially offset by an increase in certain compensation-related costs and depreciation expense.\nReconciling items\nReconciling items include certain costs that are not allocated to our operating segments results, such as costs associated with the following:\n•\nCorporate\n,\n \nwhich includes certain costs associated with information technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development, certain diagnostic costs and communications, among others. These costs also include certain compensation costs, certain procurement costs, and other miscellaneous operating expenses that are not charged to our operating segments, as well as interest income and expense; \n•\nCertain transactions and events such as \nPurchase accounting adjustments\n, \nAcquisition and divestiture-related costs\n and \nCertain significant items\n, which are defined below; and\n•\nOther unallocated\n, which includes (i) certain overhead expenses associated with our global manufacturing operations not charged to our operating segments; (ii) certain costs associated with finance that specifically support our global manufacturing operations; (iii) certain supply chain and global logistics costs; and (iv) certain procurement costs.\nThree months ended September 30, 2025 vs. three months ended September 30, 2024\nCorporate expenses were flat in the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lower depreciation expense, offset by unfavorable foreign exchange.\n31\n |\nTable of Contents\nOther unallocated expenses increased by $12 million, or 17%, in the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher manufacturing costs and other charges, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher freight charges.\nNine months ended September 30, 2025 vs. nine months ended September 30, 2024\nCorporate expenses increased by $5 million, or 1%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in compensation-related costs, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange.\nOther unallocated expenses increased by $29 million, or 14%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher manufacturing costs and other charges, partially offset by lower inventory obsolescence, freight charges and favorable foreign exchange.\nSee Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—\nNote 16. Segment Information \nfor further information.\nAdjusted net income \nGeneral description of adjusted net income (a non-GAAP financial measure) \nAdjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. The adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us. Additionally, we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. The following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized: \n•\nsenior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted net income basis; \n•\nour annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted net income basis; and \n•\nother goal setting and performance measurements.\nPurchase accounting adjustments\n \nAdjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These impacts, primarily associated with certain acquisitions, include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increase/decrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets. Therefore, the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges. \nWhile certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. We believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&D costs previously have been expensed. \nA completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income. These components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above. We have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. For example, our R&D costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. In addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. As such, in total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets. \nAcquisition and divestiture-related costs\n \nAdjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration and disintegration costs associated with significant business combinations, net asset acquisitions and divestitures. These incremental costs are excluded as they are incurred to acquire and integrate, or dispose and disintegrate, certain businesses as a result of the acquisition or disposal decision and are unique to each transaction. We have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies from these transactions. \nWe believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination, net asset acquisition or divestiture result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring or disposing of a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business. \nThe integration and disintegration costs associated with a business combination, asset acquisition or divestiture may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts generally ending within three years of the transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring, integration or disintegration activities can be lengthy. For example, due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostic business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and/or other regulatory authorities. \nCertain significant items\n \nAdjusted net income is calculated excluding certain significant items. Certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. Unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be nonrecurring; or items that relate to products that we no longer sell. While not all-\n32\n |\nTable of Contents\ninclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be costs related to a major non-acquisition or divestiture-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our non-acquisition or divestiture-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; costs related to our business process transformation program; amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by U.S. GAAP; certain asset impa\nirment charges; adjustments relate\nd to the resolution of certain tax positions; significant currency devaluation; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to legal matters. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—\nNote 15. Commitments and Contingencies\n. Our normal, ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items. \nReconciliation \nA

The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to to the timing of income taxes paid, higher inventory build-up of certain products due to increased demand and the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by higher net income adjusted by non-cash items.\nInvesting activities\nNine months ended September 30, 2025 vs. nine months ended September 30, 2024\n \nOur net cash used in investing activities was $582 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with $441 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to capital expenditures and net payments of derivative instrument activity. The net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to capital expenditures.\nFinancing activities\nNine months ended September 30, 2025 vs. nine months ended September 30, 2024\n \nOur net cash used in financing activities was $1,375 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with $1,915 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily attributable to the repayment of the aggregate principal amounts of our 2015 and 2022 senior notes due 2025, the purchase of treasury shares and related excise taxes, the payment of dividends and taxes paid on withholding shares, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in August 2025 and proceeds in connection with the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plan. The net cash \nused in \nfinancing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the purchase of treasury shares and related payment of excise taxes, the payment of dividends and taxes paid on withholding shares, partially offset by proceeds in connection with the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plan. \n36\n |\nTable of Contents\nAnalysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources\nWhile we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond, this may be subject to the environment in which we operate. Risks to our meeting future funding requirements are described in \nGlobal economic conditions\n below. \nSelected measures of liquidity and capital resources \nCertain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow:\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n(MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)\n2025\n2024\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n2,084\n \n$\n1,987 \nAccounts receivable, net\n(a)\n1,541\n \n1,316 \nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n—\n \n1,350 \nLong-term debt\n7,069\n \n5,220 \nWorking capital\n4,776\n \n2,574 \nRatio of current assets to current liabilities\n3.64:1\n1.75:1\n(a)\n    Accounts receivable are usually collected over a period of 45 to 75 days\n.\n For the periods ended September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the number of days that accounts receivables were outstanding remained within this range. We regularly monitor our accounts receivable for collectability, particularly in markets where economic conditions remain uncertain. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. Our assessment is based on such factors as past due aging, historical and expected collection patterns, the financial condition of our customers, the robust nature of our credit and collection practices and the economic environment. \nFor additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the \nAnalysis of the condensed consolidated balance sheets\n and \nAnalysis of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows\n sections of this MD&A. \nCredit facility and other lines of credit\nIn August 2025, we entered into a new and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a multi-year $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility), which expires in December 2027. The credit facility replaced our previous revolving credit facility. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to $1.75 billion. The credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for such period) of 3.50:1. Upon entering into a material acquisition, the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4.00:1, and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition. In addition, the credit facility contains other customary covenants. \nWe were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. There were no amounts drawn under the credit facility as of September 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024.\nWe have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding short-term borrowings. As of September 30, 2025, we had access to $60 million of lines of credit which expire at various times and are generally renewed annually. There were no borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of September 30, 2025 and the previous revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2024. \nDomestic and international short-term funds\nMany of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. The amount of funds held in the U.S. will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business development activities. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of U.S. and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). Actual repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional U.S. and local income taxes, such as U.S. state income taxes, local withholding taxes, and taxes on currency gains and losses. \nGlobal economic conditions\nGlobal financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic, business and financial volatility. Challenging economic conditions in recent years have not had, nor do we anticipate that it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. Due to our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. There can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nDebt securities\nOur senior notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indentures (collectively, the indenture) between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee. The indenture contains certain covenants, including limitations on our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens or engage in sale lease-back transactions. The indenture also contains restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets. In addition, the indenture contains other customary terms, including certain events of default, upon the occurrence of which, the senior notes may be declared immediately due and payable.\nPursuant to the indenture, we are able to redeem the senior notes of any series, in whole or in part, at any time by paying a “make whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade of the senior notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, we are, in certain circumstances, required to make an offer to repurchase all of the outstanding senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase.\n37\n |\nTable of Contents\nOur outstanding debt securities are as follows:\nDescription\nPrincipal Amount\nInterest Rate\nTerms\n2017 Senior Notes due 2027\n$750 million\n3.000%\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on September 12, 2027\n2018 Senior Notes due 2028\n$500 million\n3.900%\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on August 20, 2028\n2025 Senior Notes due 2028\n$850 million\n4.150%\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on August 17, 2028\n2020 Senior Notes due 2030\n$750 million\n2.000%\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on May 15, 2030\n2022 Senior Notes due 2032\n$750 million\n5.600%\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 16, 2032\n2025 Senior Notes due 2035\n$1,000 million\n5.000%\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on August 17, 2035\n2013 Senior Notes due 2043\n$1,150 million\n4.700%\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on February 1, 2043\n2017 Senior Notes due 2047\n$500 million\n3.950%\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on September 12, 2047\n2018 Senior Notes due 2048\n$400 million\n4.450%\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on August 20, 2048\n2020 Senior Notes due 2050\n$500 million\n3.000%\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on May 15, 2050\nCredit ratings\nTwo major corporate debt-rating organizations, Moody’s and S&P, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nThe following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced long-term debt:\nCommercial Paper\nLong-term Debt\nDate of Last Action\nName of Rating Agency\nRating\nRating\nOutlook\nMoody’s\nP-2\nA3\nStable\nJanuary 2025\nS&P\nA-2\nBBB+\nStable\nApril 2025\nShare repurchase program\nIn August 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a multi-year share repurchase program of up to $6 billion of our outstanding common stock. As of September 30, 2025, there was $4.5 billion remaining under this authorization. Purchases of Zoetis shares may be made at the discretion of management, depending on market conditions and business needs. Share repurchases may be executed through various means, including open market or privately negotiated transactions. During the first nine months of 2025, 7.3 million shares were repurchased for $1,158 million, which excludes a $11 million accrual for excise tax on net share repurchases. \nOff-balance sheet arrangements \nIn the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we may indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. These indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not material. \nNew accounting standards\nSee \nNote 3. Significant Accounting Policies\n in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption or expected adoption and effects or expected effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nForward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results\nThis report contains “forward-looking” statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

These risks or uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by a forward-looking statement. You should not put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q and 8-K reports and our other filings with the SEC. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the above to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties."
