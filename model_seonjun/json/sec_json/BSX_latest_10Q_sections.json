Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details and a discussion of key assumptions used in our intangible asset impairment testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our intangible assets.\nContingent Consideration Net Expense (Benefit)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet charges (benefit)\n$\n11 \n$\n(23)\n$\n11 \n$\n(4)\nPayments for prior acquisitions following the achievement of associated milestones\n— \n99 \n62 \n232 \nRefer to \nNote B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details related to our contingent consideration arrangements. \nRestructuring and Restructuring-related Net Charges (Credits)\nOn February 22, 2023, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a new global restructuring program (the 2023 Restructuring Plan). The 2023 Restructuring Plan is helping to advance our Global Supply Chain Optimization strategy, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing and distribution network by transferring certain production lines among facilities and drive operational efficiencies and resiliency. Key activities under the 2023 Restructuring Plan also include optimizing certain functional capabilities to achieve cost synergies and better support business growth.\nOn July 29, 2025, our Board of Directors approved expanding the 2023 Restructuring Plan by up to $250 million in aggregate additional pre-tax charges, to include further related activities under the program to drive operational efficiencies and optimize functional capabilities. We continue to expect the activities associated with our 2023 Restructuring Plan, including the expansion, to be substantially complete by the end of 2025. The following table provides a summary of our range of estimates of total pre-tax charges associated with the 2023 Restructuring Plan, including the expansion, by major type of cost:\n48\nTable of Content\ns\nType of Cost \n(in millions)\nTotal Estimated Amount Expected to be Incurred\nRestructuring charges:\nTermination benefits\n(1)\n$\n100 \n-\n$\n120 \nOther\n(2)\n60 \n-\n80 \nRestructuring-related expenses:\nTransfer costs\n(3)\n320 \n-\n350 \nOther\n(4)\n220 \n-\n250 \n$\n700\n \n-\n$\n800\n \n(1)\nPlans detailing specific employee impacts will be developed for each affected region and business, working with employee representative \nbodies where required under local laws.\n(2)\nConsists primarily of consulting fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations.\n(3)\nRepresents costs to transfer product and manufacturing lines between geographically dispersed facilities.\n(4)\nComprised of other costs directly related to the restructuring program, including program management, accelerated depreciation and fixed \nasset write-offs.\nIn addition, on May 28, 2025, we announced the discontinuation of worldwide sales of the ACURATE neo2™ and ACURATE Prime™ Aortic Valve Systems and that we would no longer pursue U.S. FDA approval for ACURATE or approval in other geographies. The decision resulted in total pre-tax restructuring and restructuring-related net charges of approximately $90 million in the first nine months of 2025. We expect the remaining activity to be substantially complete by the end of 2025.\nPursuant to the 2023 Restructuring Plan and the ACURATE discontinuation, we recorded the following restructuring and restructuring-related charges:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRestructuring net charges (credits)\n(1)\n$\n(8)\n$\n8 \n$\n85 \n$\n12 \nRestructuring-related net charges (credits)\n(2)\n45 \n44 \n161 \n136 \n(1)\nThese charges are recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 420, \nExit or Disposal Cost Obligations.\n(2)\nThese charges are primarily recorded within \nCost of products sold, SG&A Expenses\n \nand\n \nR&D Expenses\n.\nThe following table presents our restructuring reserve balance:\nAs of\n(in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nRestructuring reserve balance\n$\n69 \n$\n26 \nLitigation-related Net Charges (Credits)\nWe record certain legal and product liability charges, credits and costs of defense, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant as \nLitigation-related net charges (credits)\n within our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. We did not record any litigation-related net charges (credits) during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 or 2024. All other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within \nSG&A expenses\n. \nWe continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation, and therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with the financial covenant required by our credit arrangements. Refer to \nNote H – Commitments and Contingencies\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for discussion of our material legal proceedings.\n49\nTable of Content\ns\nInterest Expense\nThe following table provides a summary of our \nInterest expense\n and average borrowing rate:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nInterest expense \n(in millions)\n$\n(87)\n$\n(79)\n$\n(259)\n$\n(225)\nAverage borrowing rate\n2.9 \n%\n2.8 \n%\n2.9 \n%\n2.8 \n%\nInterest expense\n increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to a higher average borrowing rate and higher average outstanding debt balances. Refer to \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n and \nNote E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding our debt obligations.\nTax Rate\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our reported tax rate to the rate from continuing operations:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nReported tax rate\n19.5 \n%\n30.0 \n%\n17.2 \n%\n24.4 \n%\nImpact of certain receipts/charges\n(1)\n(1.4)\n%\n(12.3)\n%\n0.9 \n%\n(6.0)\n%\nRate from continuing operations\n18.1 \n%\n17.7 \n%\n18.1 \n%\n18.3 \n%\n(1)\nThese receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our rate from continuing operations.\nOur reported tax rate is affected by recurring items such as the amount of our earnings subject to differing tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at rates that differ from our rate from continuing operations. \nIn the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, the principal reason for the difference between the rate from continuing operations and our reported tax rate relates to certain acquisition-related net charges and certain discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the principal reason for the difference between the rate from continuing operations and our reported tax rate relates to certain acquisition-related net charges. In the first nine months of 2024, the principal reasons for the difference between the rate from continuing operations and our reported tax rate relate to certain acquisition-related net charges, impairment charges and certain discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was signed into law. It includes significant changes to corporate income taxes including extending and modifying many provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Provisions of the OBBBA impacting the Company include the immediate expensing of U.S. performed research and development expenditures as well as modifications to the taxation of our international operations. Certain provisions will take effect beginning in 2026, while others apply retroactively to January 1, 2025. Based on our current analysis of OBBBA, we expect an immaterial impact to our overall effective tax rate, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow in 2025.\nEffective January 1, 2024, many countries where we do business adopted a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% based on the Pillar Two framework issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The United States has not enacted the Pillar Two global minimum tax and as of June 28, 2025 the G7 countries announced an agreement to exempt U.S. companies from certain elements of the OECD global minimum tax framework. We expect that this agreement, if ultimately enacted into law in the relevant countries, would be beneficial to the Company. However, Pillar Two remains enacted law and significant uncertainty exists regarding the implementation of this agreement, the interpretation of the existing Pillar Two rules, whether such rules will be implemented consistently across taxing jurisdictions, how such rules interact with existing national tax laws and whether such rules are consistent with existing tax treaty obligations. Developments related to these uncertainties could impact our expectations regarding the impact of the Pillar Two global minimum tax on our tax rate from continuing operations in 2025 and beyond.\n50\nTable of Content\ns\nFuture legislative developments regarding the applicability of the Pillar Two tax on U.S. companies and additional guidance by the U.S. Department of the Treasury regarding OBBBA could impact our expectations and interpretations regarding the impact on our tax rate from continuing operations. \nSee \nNote G – Income Taxes\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details on our tax rate.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, there were no material changes to the application of critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of \nCash and cash equivalents\n, future cash generated from operations, access to capital markets and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, pay taxes due, service and repay our existing debt and fund possible acquisitions for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. \nAs of September 30, 2025, we had $1.275 billion of unrestricted \nCash and cash equivalents\n on hand, including approximately $61 million held by Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited, a less than wholly owned entity of which we acquired a majority stake investment during the first quarter of 2023.\n \nThe balance is comprised of $382 million invested in money market funds and time deposits and $893 million in interest bearing and non-interest-bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn at market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification, as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. \nIn 2021, we entered into our $2.750 billion revolving credit facility (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks. The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of May 10, 2029. This facility provides backing for our commercial paper program, and outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. There were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program as of September 30, 2025. There were no amounts outstanding under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2025, resulting in an additional $2.750 billion of available liquidity.\nFor additional details related to our debt obligations, including our financial covenant requirement, refer to \nNote E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities\n$\n3,170 \n$\n1,979 \nCash provided by (used for) investing activities\n(2,128)\n(1,983)\nCash provided by (used for) financing activities\n(211)\n1,600 \nOperating Activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, cash provided by (used for) operating activities increased $1.191 billion compared to the prior year period primarily due to comparatively higher sales and corresponding operating income and slower inventory buildup.\n51\nTable of Content\ns\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, cash provided by (used for) investing activities included net cash payments of $1.504 billion for acquisitions of businesses, primarily related to Bolt Medical, Inc., SoniVie Ltd., Cortex, Inc., Intera, and Anrei Medical (HZ) Co., Ltd, and \npurchases of property, plant and equipment and internal use software \nof $525 million. During the first nine months of 2024, cash used for investing activities included net cash payments of $1.222 billion for acquisitions of businesses, primarily related to Silk Road Medical, \npurchases of property, plant and equipment and internal use software\n of $513 million as well as \npayments for investments and acquisitions of certain technologies, net of investment proceeds\n of $264 million. For more information on our acquisitions, refer to \nNote B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \nFinancing Activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, cash provided by (used for) financing activities included the registered public offering of €1.500 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes (the 2025 Eurobonds). The 2025 Eurobonds offering resulted in cash proceeds of $1.558 billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs. We used the net proceeds from the 2025 Eurobonds offering to fund the repayment at maturity of AMS Europe’s €1.000 billion 0.750% Senior Notes due March 2025 and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes. \nAdditionally, we used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, short term investments, reduction of short term debt, funding of working capital and acquisitions. During the second quarter of 2025, we also repaid at maturity our \n$500 million 1.900%\n Senior Notes due June 2025 and accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes.\n During the first nine months of 2025, cash provided by (used for) financing activities also included \nproceeds from the issuances of common stock pursuant to employee stock compensation and purchase plans \nof $262 million, partially offset by repayments of commercial paper of $196 million. For more information, refer to \nNote E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \nCash provided by (used for) financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 included a registered public offering of €2.000 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes (the 2024 Eurobonds). The 2024 Eurobonds offering resulted in cash proceeds of $2.145 billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs. We primarily used the net proceeds from the 2024 Eurobonds offering to fund a portion of the purchase price of our acquisition of Axonics and to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. We also used the net proceeds to fund the repayment at maturity of $504 million of our 3.450% Senior Notes due March 2024 and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes.\nFinancial Covenant\nAs of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with the financial covenant required by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. \n \nCovenant Requirement\nas of September 30, 2025\n \nActual\nas of September 30, 2025\nMaximum permitted leverage ratio\n(1)\n4.75 times\n \n2.02 times\n(1)\n Ratio of total debt to deemed consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility credit agreement.\nThe 2021 Revolving Credit Facility includes the financial covenant requirement for all of our credit arrangements that we maintain the maximum permitted leverage ratio of 3.75 times for the remaining term. The credit agreement provides for higher leverage ratios, at our election, for the period following a Qualified Acquisition, as defined by the agreement, for which consideration exceeds $1.000 billion. In the event of such an acquisition, for the four succeeding quarters immediately following, including the quarter in which the acquisition occurs, the maximum permitted leverage ratio is 4.75 times. It steps down for the fifth, sixth and seventh succeeding quarters to 4.50 times, 4.25 times and 4.00 times, respectively. Thereafter, a maximum leverage ratio of 3.75 times is required through the remaining term of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. On November 15, 2024, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Axonics, which we had previously designated as a Qualified Acquisition under the credit agreement, increasing the maximum permitted leverage ratio to 4.75 times as of September 30, 2025. We believe that we have the ability to comply with the financial covenant for the next 12 months.\nThe financial covenant requirement, as amended on May 10, 2024, provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, through maturity, of certain charges and expenses. The credit agreement amendment reset the starting date for purposes of calculating such permitted exclusions related to restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2024. Permitted exclusions include up to $500 million in cash and non-cash restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses associated with our current or future restructuring plans. As of \n52\nTable of Content\ns\nSeptember 30, 2025, we had $77 million of the restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any cash litigation payments (net of any cash litigation receipts), as defined by the agreement, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, provided that the sum of any excluded net cash litigation payments does not exceed $1.000 billion plus all accrued legal liabilities as of December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2025, we had $1.406 billion of the litigation exclusion remaining.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOn October 17, 2025, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to acquire 100 percent of Nalu Medical, Inc. (Nalu Medical), a privately held medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative and minimally invasive solutions for patients with chronic pain. We have been an investor in Nalu Medical since 2017 and currently hold an equity stake of approximately nine percent. The transaction price to acquire the remaining stake is expected to result in an upfront cash payment of approximately $533 million upon closing. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2026, subject to customary closing conditions. We plan to fund the acquisition with cash on hand. The Nalu Medical business will be integrated into our Neuromodulation division.\nCertain of our acquisitions involve the payment of contingent consideration. Refer to \nNote B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments \nto our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details regarding the estimated potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with our acquisitions. There have been no other material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2025.\nEquity\nWe received $262 million during the first nine months of 2025 and $202 million during the first nine months of 2024 in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of our employees. \nWe did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the first nine months of 2025 or 2024. On December 14, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.000 billion of our common stock. As of September 30, 2025, we had the full amount remaining available under the authorization. \nLegal Matters\nFor a discussion of our material legal proceedings refer to \nNote H – Commitments and Contingencies\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and \nNote I – Commitments and Contingencies\n to our audited financial statements contained in Item 8 of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements implemented since December 31, 2024, and relevant accounting pronouncements to be implemented in the future are included in \nNote M – New Accounting Pronouncements\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nAdditional Information\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share (EPS) that exclude certain charges (credits); operational net sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations; and organic net sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as well as the impact of certain acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full period of comparable net sales. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. \n53\nTable of Content\ns\nTo calculate adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share, we exclude certain charges (credits) from GAAP net income and GAAP net income attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders, which include amortization expense, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition/divestiture-related net charges (credits), investment portfolio net losses (gains) and impairments, restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits), certain litigation-related net charges (credits), EU MDR implementation costs, debt extinguishment net charges, deferred tax expenses (benefits) and certain discrete tax items. Amounts are presented after-tax using our effective tax rate, unless the amount is a significant unusual or infrequently occurring item in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740-270-30, “General Methodology and Use of Estimated Annual Effective Tax Rate.” In addition to the explanation below, please refer to Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an explanation of each of these adjustments and the reasons for excluding each item. The following is an explanation of each incremental or revised adjustment type, since our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as the reason for excluding each item:\n•\nRestructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments primarily represent severance and other compensation-related charges, fixed asset write-offs, contract cancellations, project management fees, facility shut down costs, costs to transfer manufacturing lines between geographically dispersed facilities and other direct costs associated with our restructuring plans. These restructuring plans each consist of distinct initiatives that are fundamentally different from our ongoing, core cost reduction initiatives in terms of, among other things, the frequency with which each action is performed and the required planning, resourcing, cost and timing. Examples of such initiatives include the movement of business activities, facility consolidations and closures and the transfer of product lines between manufacturing facilities, which, due to the highly regulated nature of our industry, requires a significant investment in time and cost to create duplicate manufacturing lines, run product validations and seek regulatory approvals. Restructuring plans take place over a defined timeframe and have a distinct project timeline that requires, and begins subsequent to, approval by our Board of Directors. In contrast to our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, restructuring plans typically result in duplicative cost and exit costs over the defined timeframe and are not considered part of our core, ongoing operations. In addition, during the second and third quarter of 2025, we incurred restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) associated with management's decision to discontinue worldwide sales of the ACURATE neo2\nTM\n and ACURATE Prime\nTM\n Aortic Valve Systems. These restructuring plans and activities are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance.\nThe GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share are GAAP net income (loss), GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and GAAP net income (loss) per common share – diluted, respectively.\nTo calculate operational net sales growth rates, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior periods. To calculate organic net sales growth rates, we also remove the impact of certain acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full period of comparable net sales. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to operational net sales and organic net sales is net sales reported on a GAAP basis. \nReconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nManagement uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments’ measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance. \n54\nTable of Content\ns\nWe believe that presenting adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders, adjusted net income (loss) per share, operational net sales growth rates and organic net sales growth rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. \nSafe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements \nCertain statements that we may make from time to time, including statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and information incorporated by reference herein, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.\nOur currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $12.087 billion as of September 30, 2025 and $7.636 billion as of December 31, 2024. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $794 million as of September 30, 2025 compared to $322 million as of December 31, 2024. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $970 million as of September 30, 2025 compared to $394 million as of December 31, 2024. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impacts on our unaudited consolidated statements of operations.\nOur interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar and euro-denominated borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of September 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2025, $11.326 billion in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing approximately 100.0 percent of our total debt, on an amortized cost basis. As of September 30, 2025, our outstanding debt obligations at fixed interest rates were comprised of senior notes.\nRefer to \nNote D – Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding our derivative financial instruments.\n \n59\nTable of Content\ns\nITEM 4.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2025 pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and ensure that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on their evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring 2022, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace our existing system. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. In August 2025, we transitioned to the new ERP system for a significant portion of our Europe, Middle East, and Africa commercial operations. The portion of the transition to the new ERP system which we have completed to date resulted in changes in our business processes and internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2025. We have implemented or enhanced our internal control activities, where applicable, for any changes that occurred and will continue to monitor the impact on our processes, procedures, and internal control over financial reporting. As future phases are implemented, we expect the changes to have a material impact on our internal controls over financial reporting and we will evaluate whether these process changes necessitate further changes in the design of and testing for effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.\n60\nTable of Content\ns\nPART II\nOTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

Net sales of Endoscopy products of $747 million during the third quarter and $2.157 billion during the first nine months of 2025 represented 15 percent of our consolidated net sales in both periods. Endoscopy net sales increased $69 million, or 10.1 percent, during the third quarter and $160 million, or 8.0 percent, during the first nine months of 2025, compared to the prior year periods. During the third quarter of 2025, this increase included operational net sales growth of 9.0 percent and the positive impact of 110 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period. During the first nine months of 2025, this increase included operational net sales growth of 7.6 percent and the positive impact of 40 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period.\nOperational net sales growth during the third quarter of 2025 included organic net sales growth of 9.0 percent. Operational net sales growth during the first nine months of 2025 included organic net sales growth of 7.5 percent and the positive impact of 10 basis points from our acquisition of the endoluminal vacuum therapy portfolio of Braun during the first quarter of 2024. Organic net sales growth in both periods was primarily driven by our biliary franchise led by our AXIOS™ Stent and Delivery System, and our core GI and endoluminal surgery franchises.\n44\nTable of Content\ns\nUrology\nOur Urology business develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological conditions for both male and female anatomies, including kidney stones, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, erectile dysfunction and incontinence. Net sales of Urology products of $682 million during the third quarter and $1.992 billion during the first nine months of 2025 represented 13 percent of our consolidated net sales in both periods. Urology net sales increased $150 million, or 28.1 percent, during the third quarter and $422 million, or 26.9 percent, during the first nine months of 2025, compared to the prior year periods. During the third quarter of 2025, this increase included operational net sales growth of 27.5 percent and the positive impact of 60 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period. During the first nine months of 2025, this increase included operational net sales growth of 26.7 percent and a positive impact of 20 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period.\nOperational net sales growth included organic net sales growth of 5.4 percent during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, and the positive impact of 2,210 and 2,130 basis points, respectively, from our acquisition of Axonics during the fourth quarter of 2024. Organic net sales growth in both periods was primarily driven by our stone management franchise.\nNeuromodulation \nOur Neuromodulation business develops and manufactures devices to treat various neurological movement disorders and manage chronic pain. Net sales of Neuromodulation products of $293 million during the third quarter and $866 million during the first nine months of 2025 represented 6 percent of our consolidated net sales in both periods. Neuromodulation net sales increased $24 million, or 9.1 percent, during the third quarter and $60 million, or 7.4 percent, during the first nine months of 2025, compared to the prior year periods. During the third quarter of 2025, this increase included operational net sales growth of 8.6 percent and the positive impact of 50 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period. During the first nine months of 2025, this increase included operational net sales growth of 7.3 percent and a positive impact of 10 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period. \nOperational net sales growth in both periods was primarily driven by our Intracept™ Intraosseous Nerve Ablation System, and our spinal cord stimulation and deep brain stimulation franchises.\nCardiovascular\nCardiology\nOur Cardiology business develops and manufactures devices and medical technologies for diagnosing and treating a variety of diseases and abnormalities of the heart. Net sales of Cardiology products of $2.641 billion during the third quarter and $7.717 billion for the first nine months of 2025 represented 52 percent of our consolidated net sales in both periods. Cardiology net sales increased $512 million, or 24.0 percent, during the third quarter and $1.669 billion, or 27.6 percent, during the first nine months of 2025, compared to the prior year periods. During the third quarter of 2025, this increase included operational net sales growth of 23.1 percent and the positive impact of 100 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period. During the first nine months of 2025, this increase included operational net sales growth of 27.2 percent and a positive impact of 40 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period.\nOperational net sales growth in both periods was primarily driven by growth of our Electrophysiology business unit, led by our Farapulse™ Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) System, continued market penetration of Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) procedures with our WATCHMAN™ LAAC Devices, as well as our coronary therapies franchise led by our AGENT™ Drug-Coated Balloon. As previously disclosed, in the second quarter of 2025, we announced the discontinuation of worldwide sales of the ACURATE Neo2™ and ACURATE Prime™ Aortic Valve Systems and that we would no longer pursue U.S. FDA approval for ACURATE or approval in other geographies. We will instead focus our resources and efforts on the remainder of the portfolio.\n45\nTable of Content\ns\nPeripheral Interventions \nOur Peripheral Interventions business develops and manufactures products to diagnose and treat peripheral arterial and venous diseases, as well as products to diagnose, treat and ease various forms of cancer. Net sales of Peripheral Interventions products of $702 million during the third quarter and $2.056 billion during the first nine months of 2025 represented 14 percent of our consolidated net sales in both periods. Peripheral Interventions net sales increased $101 million, or 16.7 percent, during the third quarter and $291 million, or 16.5 percent, during the first nine months of 2025, compared to the prior year periods. During the third quarter of 2025, this increase included operational net sales growth of 15.8 percent and the positive impact of 90 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period. During the first nine months of 2025, this increase included operational net sales growth of 16.3 percent and a positive impact of 20 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period.\nOperational net sales growth included organic net sales growth of 6.3 percent during the third quarter of 2025 and 6.9 percent during the first nine months of 2025, and the positive impact of 950 and 940 basis points, respectively, from our acquisition of Silk Road Medical during the third quarter of 2024 and Intera during the second quarter of 2025. Organic net sales growth in both periods was primarily driven by our interventional oncology franchise led by our EMBOLD™ Fibered Coil, as well as our venous portfolio within our vascular franchise led by our Varithena™ Polidocanol Injectable Foam and EKOS™ Ultrasound Assisted Thrombolysis systems.\nEmerging Markets\n \nAs part of our strategic imperative to drive global expansion, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in Emerging Markets. Our Emerging Markets countries include all countries except the United States, Western and Central Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.\nOur Emerging Markets' net sales represented 15 percent of our consolidated net sales during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, and 16 percent and 17 percent during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. During the third quarter of 2025, our Emerging Markets net sales grew 11.8 percent on a reported basis, which included operational net sales growth of 11.5 percent and a positive impact of 20 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period. During the first nine months of 2025, our Emerging Markets net sales grew 10.0 percent on a reported basis, which included operational net sales growth of 11.2 percent and a negative impact of 110 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period. Operational net sales growth in both periods was primarily driven by growth in China, fueled by the breadth of our portfolio and focus on innovation and strong commercial execution.\nEconomic Environment\nAs a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices, our business is subject to local and international macroeconomic trends as well as geopolitical factors. While global supply chain conditions have continued to improve, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increases in cost and limited availability of certain raw materials, components, and other inputs necessary to manufacture and distribute our products due to constraints and inflation within the global supply chain, as well as increases in wage costs and the cost and time to distribute our products. Uncertainty around inflationary pressures, interest rates, trade and tariff policies, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in tax laws, as well as actions by governments in response thereto, could create additional economic challenges which could negatively impact our business operations and results. We continue to anticipate incurring incremental costs under the current schedule of tariffs on U.S. imports announced by the U.S. government, as well as the subsequent increase in tariffs introduced by China on U.S. manufactured products. While some of the announced tariffs have been adjusted and the U.S. and other governments continue negotiations on such measures, these and any further tariff increases on our products by the U.S., China or any other country or region, as well as sanctions or other measures that restrict international trade, could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and results. We continue to monitor the evolving situation while exploring opportunities to mitigate the impacts of such tariffs. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to offset the impact of tariffs, the ultimate impact of which will depend on various factors, including the timing, scope, duration and nature of any tariffs, any other trade restrictions or opportunities to mitigate such impacts. In addition, geopolitical developments and uncertainties, including related to various ongoing global conflicts and tensions, may create economic, supply chain, transportation, energy, and other challenges, including disruptions to business operations, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. \n46\nTable of Content\ns\nGross Profit \nOur \nGross profit\n was $3.542 billion and $10.175 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, respectively, and $2.897 billion and $8.395 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively.

During the third quarter of 2025, \nR&D expenses\n increased $107 million, or 26 percent, compared to the prior year period and were 40 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. During the first nine months of 2025, \nR&D expenses\n increased $327 million, or 28 percent, compared to the prior year period and were 50 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. The increase in \nR&D expenses\n in both periods was driven by investments across our businesses, including those required to support the development and clinical evidence necessary to bring newly acquired technologies to market and maintain a pipeline of  products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth.\n47\nTable of Content\ns\nOther Operating Expenses\nThe following provides a summary of certain of our other operating expenses, which are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance; refer to \nAdditional Information\n for a further description.\nAmortization Expense\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, \nAmortization expense\n increased $20 million, or 10 percent, compared to the prior year period. In the first nine months of 2025, \nAmortization expense \nincreased $38 million, or 6 percent, compared to the prior year period.\nIntangible Asset Impairment Charges\nIn 2025, we recorded \nIntangible asset impairment charges\n of less than $1 million in the third quarter and $46 million in the first nine months. In 2024, we did not record any\n Intangible asset impairment charges\n in the third quarter and recorded \nIntangible asset impairment charges \nof $276 million in the first nine months. The impairment charges recorded in 2024 were associated with amortizable intangible assets established in connection with our acquisitions of Cryterion Medical, Inc. (Cryterion) and Devoro Medical, Inc. (Devoro), which were integrated into our Electrophysiology and Peripheral Interventions business units, respectively. Intangible assets acquired from Cryterion were impaired due to strong commercial adoption of our Farapulse™ Pulsed Field Ablation System and the resulting lower revenue projections and cannibalization of our cryoablation business in major markets like the U.S. Intangible assets acquired from Devoro were impaired following management's decision to cancel the related program in the second quarter of 2024.\nRefer to \nNote C – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n contained in\n \nItem 7.

The 2023 Restructuring Plan is helping to advance our Global Supply Chain Optimization strategy, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing and distribution network by transferring certain production lines among facilities and drive operational efficiencies and resiliency. Key activities under the 2023 Restructuring Plan also include optimizing certain functional capabilities to achieve cost synergies and better support business growth.\nOn July 29, 2025, our Board of Directors approved expanding the 2023 Restructuring Plan by up to $250 million in aggregate additional pre-tax charges, to include further related activities under the program to drive operational efficiencies and optimize functional capabilities. We continue to expect the activities associated with our 2023 Restructuring Plan, including the expansion, to be substantially complete by the end of 2025. The following table provides a summary of our range of estimates of total pre-tax charges associated with the 2023 Restructuring Plan, including the expansion, by major type of cost:\n48\nTable of Content\ns\nType of Cost \n(in millions)\nTotal Estimated Amount Expected to be Incurred\nRestructuring charges:\nTermination benefits\n(1)\n$\n100 \n-\n$\n120 \nOther\n(2)\n60 \n-\n80 \nRestructuring-related expenses:\nTransfer costs\n(3)\n320 \n-\n350 \nOther\n(4)\n220 \n-\n250 \n$\n700\n \n-\n$\n800\n \n(1)\nPlans detailing specific employee impacts will be developed for each affected region and business, working with employee representative \nbodies where required under local laws.\n(2)\nConsists primarily of consulting fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations.\n(3)\nRepresents costs to transfer product and manufacturing lines between geographically dispersed facilities.\n(4)\nComprised of other costs directly related to the restructuring program, including program management, accelerated depreciation and fixed \nasset write-offs.\nIn addition, on May 28, 2025, we announced the discontinuation of worldwide sales of the ACURATE neo2™ and ACURATE Prime™ Aortic Valve Systems and that we would no longer pursue U.S. FDA approval for ACURATE or approval in other geographies. The decision resulted in total pre-tax restructuring and restructuring-related net charges of approximately $90 million in the first nine months of 2025. We expect the remaining activity to be substantially complete by the end of 2025.\nPursuant to the 2023 Restructuring Plan and the ACURATE discontinuation, we recorded the following restructuring and restructuring-related charges:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRestructuring net charges (credits)\n(1)\n$\n(8)\n$\n8 \n$\n85 \n$\n12 \nRestructuring-related net charges (credits)\n(2)\n45 \n44 \n161 \n136 \n(1)\nThese charges are recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 420, \nExit or Disposal Cost Obligations.\n(2)\nThese charges are primarily recorded within \nCost of products sold, SG&A Expenses\n \nand\n \nR&D Expenses\n.\nThe following table presents our restructuring reserve balance:\nAs of\n(in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nRestructuring reserve balance\n$\n69 \n$\n26 \nLitigation-related Net Charges (Credits)\nWe record certain legal and product liability charges, credits and costs of defense, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant as \nLitigation-related net charges (credits)\n within our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. We did not record any litigation-related net charges (credits) during the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 or 2024. All other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within \nSG&A expenses\n. \nWe continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation, and therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with the financial covenant required by our credit arrangements.

In the first nine months of 2024, the principal reasons for the difference between the rate from continuing operations and our reported tax rate relate to certain acquisition-related net charges, impairment charges and certain discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was signed into law. It includes significant changes to corporate income taxes including extending and modifying many provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Provisions of the OBBBA impacting the Company include the immediate expensing of U.S. performed research and development expenditures as well as modifications to the taxation of our international operations. Certain provisions will take effect beginning in 2026, while others apply retroactively to January 1, 2025. Based on our current analysis of OBBBA, we expect an immaterial impact to our overall effective tax rate, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow in 2025.\nEffective January 1, 2024, many countries where we do business adopted a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% based on the Pillar Two framework issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The United States has not enacted the Pillar Two global minimum tax and as of June 28, 2025 the G7 countries announced an agreement to exempt U.S. companies from certain elements of the OECD global minimum tax framework. We expect that this agreement, if ultimately enacted into law in the relevant countries, would be beneficial to the Company. However, Pillar Two remains enacted law and significant uncertainty exists regarding the implementation of this agreement, the interpretation of the existing Pillar Two rules, whether such rules will be implemented consistently across taxing jurisdictions, how such rules interact with existing national tax laws and whether such rules are consistent with existing tax treaty obligations. Developments related to these uncertainties could impact our expectations regarding the impact of the Pillar Two global minimum tax on our tax rate from continuing operations in 2025 and beyond.\n50\nTable of Content\ns\nFuture legislative developments regarding the applicability of the Pillar Two tax on U.S. companies and additional guidance by the U.S. Department of the Treasury regarding OBBBA could impact our expectations and interpretations regarding the impact on our tax rate from continuing operations. \nSee \nNote G – Income Taxes\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details on our tax rate.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, there were no material changes to the application of critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of \nCash and cash equivalents\n, future cash generated from operations, access to capital markets and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, pay taxes due, service and repay our existing debt and fund possible acquisitions for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. \nAs of September 30, 2025, we had $1.275 billion of unrestricted \nCash and cash equivalents\n on hand, including approximately $61 million held by Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited, a less than wholly owned entity of which we acquired a majority stake investment during the first quarter of 2023.\n \nThe balance is comprised of $382 million invested in money market funds and time deposits and $893 million in interest bearing and non-interest-bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn at market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification, as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. \nIn 2021, we entered into our $2.750 billion revolving credit facility (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks. The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of May 10, 2029. This facility provides backing for our commercial paper program, and outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. There were no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program as of September 30, 2025. There were no amounts outstanding under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2025, resulting in an additional $2.750 billion of available liquidity.\nFor additional details related to our debt obligations, including our financial covenant requirement, refer to \nNote E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities\n$\n3,170 \n$\n1,979 \nCash provided by (used for) investing activities\n(2,128)\n(1,983)\nCash provided by (used for) financing activities\n(211)\n1,600 \nOperating Activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, cash provided by (used for) operating activities increased $1.191 billion compared to the prior year period primarily due to comparatively higher sales and corresponding operating income and slower inventory buildup.\n51\nTable of Content\ns\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, cash provided by (used for) investing activities included net cash payments of $1.504 billion for acquisitions of businesses, primarily related to Bolt Medical, Inc., SoniVie Ltd., Cortex, Inc., Intera, and Anrei Medical (HZ) Co., Ltd, and \npurchases of property, plant and equipment and internal use software \nof $525 million. During the first nine months of 2024, cash used for investing activities included net cash payments of $1.222 billion for acquisitions of businesses, primarily related to Silk Road Medical, \npurchases of property, plant and equipment and internal use software\n of $513 million as well as \npayments for investments and acquisitions of certain technologies, net of investment proceeds\n of $264 million. For more information on our acquisitions, refer to \nNote B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \nFinancing Activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, cash provided by (used for) financing activities included the registered public offering of €1.500 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes (the 2025 Eurobonds). The 2025 Eurobonds offering resulted in cash proceeds of $1.558 billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs. We used the net proceeds from the 2025 Eurobonds offering to fund the repayment at maturity of AMS Europe’s €1.000 billion 0.750% Senior Notes due March 2025 and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes. \nAdditionally, we used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, short term investments, reduction of short term debt, funding of working capital and acquisitions. During the second quarter of 2025, we also repaid at maturity our \n$500 million 1.900%\n Senior Notes due June 2025 and accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes.\n During the first nine months of 2025, cash provided by (used for) financing activities also included \nproceeds from the issuances of common stock pursuant to employee stock compensation and purchase plans \nof $262 million, partially offset by repayments of commercial paper of $196 million. For more information, refer to \nNote E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \nCash provided by (used for) financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 included a registered public offering of €2.000 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes (the 2024 Eurobonds). The 2024 Eurobonds offering resulted in cash proceeds of $2.145 billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs. We primarily used the net proceeds from the 2024 Eurobonds offering to fund a portion of the purchase price of our acquisition of Axonics and to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. We also used the net proceeds to fund the repayment at maturity of $504 million of our 3.450% Senior Notes due March 2024 and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes.\nFinancial Covenant\nAs of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with the financial covenant required by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. \n \nCovenant Requirement\nas of September 30, 2025\n \nActual\nas of September 30, 2025\nMaximum permitted leverage ratio\n(1)\n4.75 times\n \n2.02 times\n(1)\n Ratio of total debt to deemed consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility credit agreement.\nThe 2021 Revolving Credit Facility includes the financial covenant requirement for all of our credit arrangements that we maintain the maximum permitted leverage ratio of 3.75 times for the remaining term. The credit agreement provides for higher leverage ratios, at our election, for the period following a Qualified Acquisition, as defined by the agreement, for which consideration exceeds $1.000 billion. In the event of such an acquisition, for the four succeeding quarters immediately following, including the quarter in which the acquisition occurs, the maximum permitted leverage ratio is 4.75 times. It steps down for the fifth, sixth and seventh succeeding quarters to 4.50 times, 4.25 times and 4.00 times, respectively. Thereafter, a maximum leverage ratio of 3.75 times is required through the remaining term of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. On November 15, 2024, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Axonics, which we had previously designated as a Qualified Acquisition under the credit agreement, increasing the maximum permitted leverage ratio to 4.75 times as of September 30, 2025. We believe that we have the ability to comply with the financial covenant for the next 12 months.\nThe financial covenant requirement, as amended on May 10, 2024, provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, through maturity, of certain charges and expenses. The credit agreement amendment reset the starting date for purposes of calculating such permitted exclusions related to restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2024. Permitted exclusions include up to $500 million in cash and non-cash restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses associated with our current or future restructuring plans. As of \n52\nTable of Content\ns\nSeptember 30, 2025, we had $77 million of the restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any cash litigation payments (net of any cash litigation receipts), as defined by the agreement, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, provided that the sum of any excluded net cash litigation payments does not exceed $1.000 billion plus all accrued legal liabilities as of December 31, 2022. As of September 30, 2025, we had $1.406 billion of the litigation exclusion remaining.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOn October 17, 2025, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to acquire 100 percent of Nalu Medical, Inc. (Nalu Medical), a privately held medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative and minimally invasive solutions for patients with chronic pain. We have been an investor in Nalu Medical since 2017 and currently hold an equity stake of approximately nine percent. The transaction price to acquire the remaining stake is expected to result in an upfront cash payment of approximately $533 million upon closing. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2026, subject to customary closing conditions. We plan to fund the acquisition with cash on hand. The Nalu Medical business will be integrated into our Neuromodulation division.\nCertain of our acquisitions involve the payment of contingent consideration. Refer to \nNote B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments \nto our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details regarding the estimated potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with our acquisitions. There have been no other material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2025.\nEquity\nWe received $262 million during the first nine months of 2025 and $202 million during the first nine months of 2024 in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of our employees. \nWe did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the first nine months of 2025 or 2024. On December 14, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.000 billion of our common stock. As of September 30, 2025, we had the full amount remaining available under the authorization. \nLegal Matters\nFor a discussion of our material legal proceedings refer to \nNote H – Commitments and Contingencies\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and \nNote I – Commitments and Contingencies\n to our audited financial statements contained in Item 8 of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements implemented since December 31, 2024, and relevant accounting pronouncements to be implemented in the future are included in \nNote M – New Accounting Pronouncements\n to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nAdditional Information\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share (EPS) that exclude certain charges (credits); operational net sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations; and organic net sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as well as the impact of certain acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full period of comparable net sales. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. \n53\nTable of Content\ns\nTo calculate adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share, we exclude certain charges (credits) from GAAP net income and GAAP net income attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders, which include amortization expense, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition/divestiture-related net charges (credits), investment portfolio net losses (gains) and impairments, restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits), certain litigation-related net charges (credits), EU MDR implementation costs, debt extinguishment net charges, deferred tax expenses (benefits) and certain discrete tax items. Amounts are presented after-tax using our effective tax rate, unless the amount is a significant unusual or infrequently occurring item in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740-270-30, “General Methodology and Use of Estimated Annual Effective Tax Rate.” In addition to the explanation below, please refer to Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an explanation of each of these adjustments and the reasons for excluding each item. The following is an explanation of each incremental or revised adjustment type, since our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as the reason for excluding each item:\n•\nRestructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments primarily represent severance and other compensation-related charges, fixed asset write-offs, contract cancellations, project management fees, facility shut down costs, costs to transfer manufacturing lines between geographically dispersed facilities and other direct costs associated with our restructuring plans. These restructuring plans each consist of distinct initiatives that are fundamentally different from our ongoing, core cost reduction initiatives in terms of, among other things, the frequency with which each action is performed and the required planning, resourcing, cost and timing. Examples of such initiatives include the movement of business activities, facility consolidations and closures and the transfer of product lines between manufacturing facilities, which, due to the highly regulated nature of our industry, requires a significant investment in time and cost to create duplicate manufacturing lines, run product validations and seek regulatory approvals. Restructuring plans take place over a defined timeframe and have a distinct project timeline that requires, and begins subsequent to, approval by our Board of Directors. In contrast to our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, restructuring plans typically result in duplicative cost and exit costs over the defined timeframe and are not considered part of our core, ongoing operations. In addition, during the second and third quarter of 2025, we incurred restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) associated with management's decision to discontinue worldwide sales of the ACURATE neo2\nTM\n and ACURATE Prime\nTM\n Aortic Valve Systems. These restructuring plans and activities are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance.\nThe GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share are GAAP net income (loss), GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and GAAP net income (loss) per common share – diluted, respectively.\nTo calculate operational net sales growth rates, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior periods. To calculate organic net sales growth rates, we also remove the impact of certain acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full period of comparable net sales. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to operational net sales and organic net sales is net sales reported on a GAAP basis. \nReconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nManagement uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments’ measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance. \n54\nTable of Content\ns\nWe believe that presenting adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders, adjusted net income (loss) per share, operational net sales growth rates and organic net sales growth rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. \nSafe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements \nCertain statements that we may make from time to time, including statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and information incorporated by reference herein, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
