  "item1": "ITEM 1.  Business\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nThe TJX Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “TJX,” the “Company,” “we,” or “our”) is the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the United States and worldwide. We have over 5,000 stores and six branded e-commerce sites that offer a rapidly changing assortment of quality, fashionable, brand name and designer merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers’ (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day.\nOur mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day. In our stores and online, we offer consumers our value proposition of brand, fashion, price and quality. Our opportunistic buying strategies and flexible business model differentiate us from traditional retailers. We offer a treasure hunt shopping experience and a rapid turn of inventories relative to traditional retailers. Our goal is to create a sense of excitement and urgency for our customers and encourage frequent customer visits. We acquire merchandise in a variety of ways to support that goal. We reach a broad range of customers across income levels with our value proposition on a wide range of items. Our strategies and operations are synergistic across our retail chains. As a result, we are able to leverage our expertise throughout our business, sharing information, best practices, initiatives and new ideas, and to develop talent across our company. Further, we can leverage the substantial buying power of our businesses with our global vendor relationships.\nIn this report, fiscal 2025 means the 52-week fiscal year ended February 1, 2025; fiscal 2024 means the 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 and fiscal 2023 means the 52-week fiscal year ended January 28, 2023. Fiscal 2026 means the 52-week fiscal year ending January 31, 2026. Unless otherwise indicated, all store information in this Item 1 is as of February 1, 2025, and references to store square footage are to gross square feet. \nOur Businesses\nWe operate our business in four segments: Marmaxx and HomeGoods, both in the U.S., TJX Canada and TJX International, including Europe and Australia. In addition to our four segments, we operate the Sierra business. The results of Sierra are included with the Marmaxx segment.\nMARMAXX\nOur TJ Maxx and Marshalls chains in the United States (“Marmaxx”) are collectively the largest off-price retailer in the United States with a total of 2,563 stores. We founded TJ Maxx in 1976 and acquired Marshalls in 1995. Both chains sell family apparel (including footwear), accessories (including beauty and jewelry), home fashions (including home basics, decorative accessories and giftware), and other merchandise. We primarily differentiate TJ Maxx and Marshalls through different product assortment, including an expanded assortment of jewelry and accessories and a high-end designer department called The Runway at TJ Maxx and a full line of footwear and a broader men’s offering at Marshalls, as well as varying in-store initiatives. This differentiated shopping experience at TJ Maxx and Marshalls encourages our customers to shop both chains. Marmaxx currently operates two e-commerce sites, tjmaxx.com, launched in 2013, and marshalls.com, launched in 2019.  \nSierra, acquired in 2012 and rebranded from Sierra Trading Post in 2018, is a leading off-price retailer of brand name active and outdoor apparel, footwear, and gear (including sporting goods, snow and water sport, camping, fishing) for the whole family, as well as home fashions and pet. Sierra operates 117 retail stores in the U.S. and sierra.com.\nHOMEGOODS\nOur HomeGoods segment operates HomeGoods and Homesense chains in the U.S. HomeGoods, introduced in 1992, is the leading off-price retailer of home fashions in the U.S. Through its 943 stores, HomeGoods offers an eclectic assortment of home fashions, including furniture, rugs, lighting, soft home, decorative accessories, tabletop and cookware, as well as expanded pet and gourmet food departments. In 2017, we launched our Homesense chain in the U.S. Our 72 Homesense stores complement HomeGoods, offering a differentiated mix and expanded departments, such as large furniture, ceiling lighting, rugs, and an entertaining marketplace. \n5\nTJX CANADA\nOur TJX Canada segment operates the Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls chains in Canada. Winners, acquired by TJX in 1990, operates 307 stores and is the leading off-price family apparel and home fashions retailer in Canada. HomeSense introduced the off-price home fashions concept to Canada in 2001. This chain operates 160 stores and offers an array of home decor, furniture, and seasonal home merchandise. Marshalls, launched in Canada in 2011, operates 109 stores and offers off-price family apparel, footwear, and home fashions. \nTJX INTERNATIONAL\nOur TJX International segment operates the TK Maxx and Homesense chains in Europe and the TK Maxx chain in Australia. Launched in 1994, TK Maxx introduced off-price retail to Europe and remains Europe’s largest major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions. With 655 stores in Europe, TK Maxx operates in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Poland, Austria and the Netherlands. Through its stores and its e-commerce sites, tkmaxx.com, launched in 2009 and tkmaxx.de and tkmaxx.at, both launched in 2023, TK Maxx offers a merchandise mix similar to TJ Maxx. We brought the off-price home fashions concept to Europe, opening Homesense in the U.K. in 2008 and in Ireland in 2017. Its 75 stores offer a merchandise mix of home fashions similar to that of HomeGoods in the U.S. and HomeSense in Canada. We acquired Trade Secret in Australia in 2015 and re-branded it under the TK Maxx name during 2017. The merchandise offering at TK Maxx in Australia's 84 stores is comparable to TJ Maxx.\nFlexible Business Model\nOur flexible business model, including our opportunistic buying, inventory management, logistics and flexible store layouts, is designed to deliver to our customers a compelling value proposition of fashionable, quality, brand name and designer merchandise at excellent values every day. Our buying and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers, and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility. Our buyers have more visibility into consumer, fashion and market trends and pricing when we buy closer to need, which can help us buy better and reduce our markdown exposure. Our selling floor space is flexible, without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures, so we can easily expand and contract departments to accommodate the merchandise we purchase. Our logistics and distribution operations are designed to support our global buying strategies and to facilitate quick, efficient and differentiated delivery of merchandise to our stores, with a goal of delivering the right merchandise to the right stores at the right time.\nOpportunistic Buying\nAs an off-price retailer, our buying practices, which we refer to as opportunistic buying, differentiate us from traditional retailers. Our overall global buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded, designer and other quality merchandise in our stores at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at full-price retailers, including department, specialty, and major online retailers. We seek out and select merchandise from the broad range of opportunities in the market to achieve this end. Our buying organization, which numbers over 1,300 employees (who we refer to as Associates), has buying offices across the globe and executes this opportunistic buying strategy, buying merchandise from more than 100 countries in a variety of ways, depending on market conditions and other factors.\nWe take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the production and flow of inventory in the apparel and home fashions marketplace. These opportunities include, among others, closeouts from brands, manufacturers and other retailers; special production direct from brands and factories; order cancellations and manufacturer overruns. Our global buying strategies are intentionally flexible to allow us to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what we source as well as when we source it. Our goal is to operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give us the flexibility to seek out and to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise, close to the time the merchandise is needed in our stores and online and when we have more visibility into fashion trends and price. In contrast to traditional retailers, which tend to order most of their goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor, our merchants generally remain in the marketplace for goods throughout the year, frequently looking for opportunities to buy merchandise. We buy much of our merchandise for the current or immediately upcoming selling season. We also buy some merchandise that is available in the market with the intention of storing it for sale, typically in future selling seasons. We generally make these purchases, referred to as packaway, in response to opportunities to buy merchandise that we believe has the right combination of brand, fashion, price and quality to supplement the product we expect to be available to purchase later for those future seasons. \nWe also acquire some merchandise that we offer under in-house brands or brands that are licensed to us. We develop some of this merchandise ourselves, which allows us to supplement the depth of, or fill gaps in, our expected merchandise assortment. Collectively, these represent a small percentage of our product/merchandise mix.\n6\nManufacturers, retailers and other vendors made up our expansive and changing universe of more than 21,000 vendors across the globe, including thousands of new vendors in fiscal 2025, which provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and expect this will continue should we meet or exceed our plans for growth. We believe a number of factors provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise and make us an attractive channel for many vendors in the market. We are typically willing to purchase less-than-full assortments of items, styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large; we are able to disperse merchandise across our geographically diverse network of store\ns and to target specific markets; we pay promptly according to our payment terms; our practice is to not ask for typical retail concessions (such as advertising, promotional and markdown allowances), delivery concessions (such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries) or performance-based return privileges; and we have an excellent credit rating.\nInventory Management\nWe offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a treasure hunt experience in our stores and to encourage frequent customer visits. To achieve this, we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly, regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values. Our specialized inventory planning, purchasing, monitoring and markdown systems, coupled with distribution center storage, processing, handling and shipping systems, enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and demographics, achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover on a vast array of products and generally sell through most merchandise within the period we planned. We make pricing, markdown and store inventory decisions centrally, using information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner. We invest in our supply chain with the goal of continuing to operate with low inventory levels, to ship more efficiently and quickly, and to more precisely and effectively allocate merchandise to each store. \nPricing\nOur mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day. We do this by offering quality, fashionable, brand name and designer merchandise in our stores with retail prices that are generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers’ (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. Our practice is to not \nengage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons. We have generally been able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our pricing gap relative to prices offered by traditional retailers as well \nas our merchandise margins through various economic cycles.\nLow Cost Operations\nWe operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers with a prudent focus on expenses throughout our business. Our advertising is generally focused on promoting our retail banners rather than individual products, which contributes to our advertising budget (as a percentage of sales) remaining low compared to many traditional retailers. We design our stores to provide a pleasant, convenient shopping environment without spending heavily on store fixtures. Additionally, our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively.\nCustomer Service/Shopping Experience\nWe strategically renovate and upgrade our stores across our retail banners to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and help drive sales. We train our store Associates to provide friendly and helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience. We believe we offer return policies that are customer friendly. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash, credit cards and debit cards. We also offer TJX-branded credit cards in the U.S. through a bank, but do not own the customer receivables.\nDistribution\nWe operate distribution centers encompassing \napproximately 30 million square feet in six countries\n. These centers are generally large, and built to suit our specific, off-price business model, with a combination of automated systems and manual processes to manage the variety of merchandise we acquire. We ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through a network of distribution centers, fulfillment centers and warehouses as well as shipping centers operated in many cases by third parties.\n7\nStore Growth\nExpansion of our business through the addition of new stores continues to be an important part of our global growth strategy. The following table provides store growth information for our divisions for the two most recently completed fiscal years, as well as our estimates of the long-term store growth potential of these divisions in their current geographies:\n  \nApproximate\nAverage Store\nSize (square feet)\nNumber of Stores at Year-End\nEstimated Store\nPotential\n  \nFiscal 2024\nFiscal 2025\nMarmaxx:\nTJ Maxx\n27,000\n1,319 \n1,333\n \nMarshalls\n28,000\n1,197 \n1,230\n \n \nTotal Marmaxx\n \n2,516 \n2,563\n \n3,000 \nHomeGoods:\nHomeGoods\n23,000\n919 \n943\n \nHomesense\n27,000\n55 \n72\n \n \nTotal HomeGoods\n \n974 \n1,015\n \n1,800 \nSierra:\nSierra\n21,000\n95 \n117\n \n325 \nTJX Canada:\nWinners\n27,000\n302 \n307\n \nHomeSense\n24,000\n158 \n160\n \nMarshalls\n27,000\n106 \n109\n \n \nTotal TJX Canada\n \n566 \n576\n \n650 \nTJX International:\nTK Maxx (Europe)\n28,000\n644 \n655\n \nHomesense (Europe)\n19,000\n79 \n75\n \nTK Maxx (Australia)\n21,000\n80 \n84\n \n \nTotal TJX International\n \n803 \n814\n \n1,225 \n(a)\nTJX Total\n \n4,954 \n5,085\n \n7,000 \n(a)\nReflects store growth potential for TK Maxx in current geographies and the expansion into Spain and for Homesense in the United Kingdom and Ireland.    \nSome of our home fashion stores are co-located with one of our apparel stores in a combo or superstore format. We count each of the stores in the combo or superstore format as a separate store.\nCompetition\nThe retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive. We compete on numerous factors including brand, fashion, price, quality, selection and freshness; in-store and online shopping experience and service; reputation and store location. We compete with local, regional, national and international department, specialty, off-price, discount, warehouse and outlet stores as well as other retailers that sell apparel, home fashions and other merchandise that we sell, whether in stores, online, or through other media or channels.\nHuman Capital\nAs of February 1, 2025, we had approximately\n 364,000\n Associates, many of whom worked less than 40 hours per week. Approximately 86% of these Associates worked in our retail stores. We hire thousands of temporary employees each year, particularly during the peak back-to-school and holiday seasons. We offer positions at a variety of levels in our stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, and offices, as well as many opportunities for Associates to grow and advance. Many Associates in our distribution centers in the United States and Canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements and other Associates are members of works councils in Europe. Our large, global workforce supports the execution of our flexible business model, including the timing and frequency of store deliveries and the management of a rapidly changing mix of merchandise in over 5,000 retail stores in nine countries and across six e-commerce sites. We believe our Associates are key to our business success.\n8\nWorkplace and Culture\nWe work to foster a strong, supportive, and inclusive culture so that Associates at TJX feel welcome in the Company, valued for their contributions, and engaged with our business mission. We use defined cultural factors and leadership competencies throughout our global business to express our organizational values, such as inclusion, personal integrity, relationship-building and collaboration, and respect for our business model, and to promote consistency in leadership development, including through our Leadership Development Toolkit. We believe our policies and practices, including our open-door philosophy, encourage open and honest communication and Associate engagement with the business.\nInclusion and Diversity (“I&D”)\nAs a global company appealing to a broad customer demographic and with hundreds of thousands of Associates in several geographies, we recognize the importance of diversity to our Company’s culture. Our global workforce reflects a diversity of races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, gender identities, abilities, religions, with a broad range of backgrounds and experience. We are committed to continuing to build and support an inclusive and diverse workplace. Our global strategies include increasing the representation of diverse talent through our talent pipeline; providing leaders with tools to support difference with awareness, fairness, sensitivity, and transparency; and integrating inclusive behaviors, language and practices throughout the business. Over the past several years, with the benefit of information gathered from Associates through our Global Inclusion Surveys, our teams globally have developed and launched many new programs, including recruitment strategies, training and education, Associate-led I&D advisory boards, and additional Associate Resource Groups. \nTraining and Career Development\nOur culture prioritizes Associate development and advancement within our organization and we have many Associates in managerial positions who have been with the Company for more than 10 years. We are highly focused on teaching and mentoring to support the career growth and success of our Associates, and we believe these efforts have promoted retention, stability, and increased expertise in our workforce. Training happens broadly throughout the organization, from informal mentoring and direct training to a range of career and leadership development programs, such as our TJX University for merchandising Associates.\nCompensation and Rewards\nOur compensation programs are designed to pay our Associates competitively in the market and equitably, based on their skills, qualifications, role and abilities. Our approach to compensation across the organization reflects our global total rewards principles, which include sharing in the success of the Company, encouraging teamwork and collaboration across our global workforce, and being fair and equitable. For fiscal 2025, we continued our One TJX approach to annual incentive compensation, with all eligible Associates measured against global TJX performance goals.\nTrademarks\nWe have the right to use our principal trademarks and service marks, which are TJ Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners, Homesense/HomeSense, TK Maxx and Sierra, in relevant countries. We expect our rights in these trademarks and service marks to endure in locations where we use them for as long as we continue to do so.\nSeasonality\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences. In the second half of the year, which includes the back-to-school and year-end holiday seasons, we generally realize higher levels of sales and income.\nSEC Filings and Certifications\nCopies of our annual reports on Form 10-K, proxy statements, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with or furnished to the SEC, and any amendments to those documents, are available free of charge on our website, tjx.com, under “SEC Filings,” as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTJX provides projections and other forward-looking statements in the following discussions particularly relating to our future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are estimates based on information currently available to us and subject to the cautionary statements set forth on page 3 of this Form 10-K. Our results are subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by any such forward-looking statements. Applicable risks and uncertainties include, among others, those described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, as well as other information we file with the SEC. TJX undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied in such statements will not be realized.\nThe discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal year ended February 1, 2025 (fiscal 2025) and our 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 (fiscal 2024) and our 52-week fiscal year ended January 31, 2026 (fiscal 2026).\nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results. Discussions of fiscal 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. Our mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day. We do this by selling a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers’ (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day through our stores and six e-commerce sites. We operate over \n5,000\n stores through our fou\nr segments:\n in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates TJ Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and HomeGoods (which operates HomeGoods and Homesense); TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International (which operates TK Maxx, Homesense, tkmaxx.com, tkmaxx.de, and tkmaxx.at in Europe, and TK Maxx in Australia). In addition to our fou\nr segments,\n Sierra operates retail stores and sierra.com in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nHighlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2025 include the following:\n–\nNet sales increased 4% to $56.4 billion for fiscal 2025 versus $54.2 billion for fiscal 2024. As of February 1, 2025, the number of stores in operation increased approximately 3% and selling square footage increased approximately 2% compared to the end of fiscal 2024.\n–\nConsolidated comp store sales increased 4% in fiscal 2025. See Net Sales below for the definition of comp store sales.\n–\nDiluted earnings per share were $4.26 for fiscal 2025, compared to $3.86 for fiscal 2024, which included an estimated benefit of $0.10 from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024.\n–\nPre-tax profit margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) for fiscal 2025 was 11.5%. This was a 0.5 percentage point increase compared to 11.0% for fiscal 2024, which included an estimated 0.1 percentage point benefit from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. \n–\nOur cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, ratio for fiscal 2025 was 69.4%, a 0.6 percentage point decrease compared to 70.0% for fiscal 2024. \n–\nOur selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense ratio for fiscal 2025 was 19.4%, a 0.1 percentage point increase compared to 19.3% for fiscal 2024.\n–\nOur consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce sites and Sierra stores, were up 1% at the end of fiscal 2025 as compared to the prior year.\n–\nDuring fiscal 2025, we returned $4.1 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. A dividend of $0.375 per share was declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and paid in March 2025.\n–\nWe announced that we plan to enter Spain with our TK Maxx banner in fiscal 2027.\n28\nEquity Investments\nDuring fiscal 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement for a joint venture with Grupo Axo, S.A.P.I de C.V. (“Axo”) to hold a 49% ownership stake in Multibrand Outlet Stores S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“MOS”) which operates off-price, physical store businesses in Mexico and includes a total of over 200 stores for its Promoda, Reduced, and Urban Store banners. We have the option to increase our ownership interest in the joint venture over the long term.\n \nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed this investment for $193 million, which includes a purchase price of $179 million and acquisition costs of $14 million. This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 35% ownership stake in privately held Brands for Less (“BFL”), representing a non-controlling, minority position. BFL currently operates over 100 stores, primarily in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, as well as an e-commerce business, and is the region’s only major off-price branded apparel, toys and home fashions retailer. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed this investment for $358 million, which includes a purchase price of $344 million and acquisition costs of $14 million. This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\nThe results of our share of both of these investments are recorded on a one-quarter lag as their results are not expected to be available in time to be recorded in the concurrent period. These investments did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2025 results and we do not expect them to have a material impact on our fiscal 2026 results.\nRecent Events and Trends\nGlobal Economic Conditions and Industry Trends\nWe continue to closely monitor changes in international trade relations, economic and monetary policies, or legislation and regulations including those related to tariffs on imports from China and other countries, which could adversely impact the global economy and our operating results. In particular, uncertainty remains regarding the potential impact on our direct imports, (with typically less than 10% of the merchandise that we purchase for our U.S. businesses directly imported from China), vendor and competitor pricing, consumer demand, tariff pass-throughs, and reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs.\nOperating Results as a Percentage of Net Sales\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales.\n  \nPercentage of Net Sales\n  \nFiscal 2025\nFiscal 2024\nNet sales\n100.0\n \n%\n100.0 \n%\nCost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs\n69.4\n \n70.0 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n19.4\n \n19.3 \nInterest (income) expense, net\n(0.3)\n(0.3)\nIncome before income taxes\n*\n11.5\n \n%\n11.0 \n%\n*\nFigures may not foot due to rounding.\nNet Sales\nNet sales for fiscal 2025 totaled $56.4 billion, a 4% increase versus net sales of $54.2 billion for fiscal 2024. The increase includes a 4% increase in comp store sales, a 2% increase from non-comp store sales, a neutral impact from foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a negative 2% estimated year-over-year impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. Net sales from our e-commerce sites combined amounted to less than 2% of total sales for both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024.\nComp store sales increased 4% for fiscal 2025 and increased 5% for fiscal 2024. Comp store sales for fiscal 2025 was driven by an increase in customer transactions. Both home comp store sales growth (as defined below) and apparel comp store sales growth (as defined below) generally performed in line with the overall comp store sales increase for fiscal 2025.\nAs of February 1, 2025, our store count increased approximately 3% and selling square footage increased approximately 2% compared to the same period last year.\nDefinition of Comparable Store Sales\nWe define comparable store sales, or comp store sales, to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or, in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. In any given fiscal year, we calculate comp store sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp store sales percentage is immaterial.\n29\nSales excluded from comp store sales (“non-comp store sales”) consist of sales from:\n–\nNew stores - stores that have not yet met the comp store sales criteria, which represents a substantial majority of non-comp store sales\n–\nStores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time\n–\nSales from our e-commerce sites (starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we will no longer exclude sales from our e-commerce sites from comp store sales, which we do not expect to have a material impact on such figures).\nWe determine which stores are included in the comp store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year, and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year. \nComp store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis. We define constant currency basis as translating the current year’s results using the prior year’s exchange rates. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more appropriate measure of performance.\nComp store sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies. The method for calculating comp store sales varies across the retail industry; therefore, our measure of comp store sales may not be comparable to that of other retail companies. Comparable store sales for a category such as home or apparel include sales from merchandise within such category combined across all divisions at the stores that fall within the Company’s definition of comparable stores for such period.\nWe define customer transactions to be the number of transactions in stores included in the comp store sales calculation. We define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions. \nRevenues by Geography\nThe percentages of our consolidated revenues by geography for the last two fiscal years are as follows:\nFiscal 2025\nFiscal 2024\nUnited States:\nNortheast\n21\n \n%\n22 \n%\nMidwest\n13\n \n13 \nSouth (including Puerto Rico)\n28\n \n28 \nWest\n16\n \n15 \nTotal United States\n78\n \n%\n78 \n%\nCanada\n9\n \n9 \nEurope\n12\n \n12 \nAustralia\n1\n \n1 \nTotal TJX\n100\n \n%\n100 \n%\nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nOur operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar or a division’s local currency in relation to other currencies. We specifically refer to “foreign currency” as the impact of translational foreign currency exchange and mark-to-market of inventory derivatives, as described in detail below. This does not include the impact foreign currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency, which is referred to as “transactional foreign exchange,” and also described below.\nTranslation Foreign Exchange\nIn our Consolidated Financial Statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in assets, liabilities, net sales, net income and earnings per share as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period.\n30\nMark-to-Market Inventory Derivatives\nWe routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected hedge accounting for these instruments, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report.\nTransactional Foreign Exchange\nWhen discussing the impact on our results of the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on certain transactions, we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange”. This primarily includes the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on the year-over-year comparison of merchandise margin as well as “foreign currency gains and losses” on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the operating division's local currency. These two items can impact segment margin comparison of our foreign divisions and we have highlighted them when they are meaningful to understanding operating trends.\nCost of Sales, Including Buying and Occupancy Costs\nCost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 69.4% for fiscal 2025, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points compared to 70.0% of net sales for fiscal 2024. \nThe decrease in the cost of sales ratio, including buying and occupancy costs, was attributable to higher merchandise margin due to higher markon, lower freight costs and lower inventory shrink expense, partially offset by higher supply chain costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was 19.4% for fiscal 2025, an increase of 0.1 percentage points compared to 19.3% for fiscal 2024.\nThe \nincrease\n in SG&A ratio for\n fiscal 2025 was due to incremental store wage and payroll costs, partially offset by a favorable year-over-year impact from a prior year reserve related to a German COVID program receivable and the year-over-year benefit from closing HomeGoods’ e-commerce business last year.\nInterest (Income) Expense, net\nThe components of interest (income) expense, net for the last two fiscal years are summarized below:\n  \nFiscal Year Ended\nIn millions\nFebruary 1,\n2025\nFebruary 3,\n2024\n(53 weeks)\nInterest expense\n$\n78\n \n$\n82 \nCapitalized interest\n(2)\n(3)\nInterest (income)\n(257)\n(249)\nInterest (income) expense, net\n$\n(181)\n$\n(170)\nInterest (income) expense, net increased for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 due to an increase in interest income driven by a higher average cash balance.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. Subsequently multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued. Many non-US tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. These rules did not have a material impact on our financial statements for fiscal 2025 and did not materially increase our global tax costs on our fiscal 2025 financial statements. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two model rules. We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact Pillar Two Model Rules in the non-US tax jurisdictions in which we operate.\n31\nThe effective income tax rate was 25.0% for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. There were no significant changes to our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2025, compared to fiscal 2024.\nNet Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share\nNet income was $4.9 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $4.5 billion in fiscal 2024. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2025 were $4.26 compared to $3.86 in fiscal 2024, which included an estimated benefit of $0.10 per share from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. Foreign currency had a $0.01 positive impact on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2025 compared to a neutral impact on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2024. \nSegment Information\nWe operate four segments. In the United States, our Marmaxx segment operates TJ Maxx, Marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com and our HomeGoods segment operates HomeGoods and Homesense. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates TK Maxx, Homesense, tkmaxx.com, tkmaxx.de, and tkmaxx.at in Europe and TK Maxx in Australia. In addition to our four segments, Sierra operates retail stores and sierra.com in the U.S. The results of Sierra are included in the Marmaxx segment.\nWe evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss,” which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest (income) expense, net, and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items. “Segment profit or loss,” as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities, as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.\nPresented below is selected financial information related to our segments.\n32\nU.S. SEGMENTS\nMarmaxx\n  \nFiscal Year Ended\nU.S. dollars in millions\nFebruary 1,\n2025\nFebruary 3,\n2024\n(53 weeks)\nNet sales\n$\n34,604\n \n$\n33,413 \nSegment profit\n$\n4,895\n \n$\n4,597 \nSegment profit margin\n14.1\n \n%\n13.8 \n%\nComp store sales\n4\n \n%\n6 \n%\nStores in operation at end of period:\nTJ Maxx\n1,333\n \n1,319 \nMarshalls\n1,230\n \n1,197 \nSierra\n117\n \n95 \nTotal\n2,680\n \n2,611 \nSelling square footage at end of period (in millions):\nTJ Maxx\n30\n \n29 \nMarshalls\n27\n \n27 \nSierra\n1\n \n1 \nTotal\n58\n \n57 \nNet Sales\nNet sales for Marmaxx were $34.6 billion for fiscal 2025, an increase of 4% compared to $33.4 billion for fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales reflects a 4% increase from comp store sales and a 2% increase from non-comp store sales, partially offset by a negative 2% estimated year-over-year impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. \nThe increase in comp store sales for fiscal 2025 was driven by an increase in customer transactions. While both Marmaxx home and apparel comp store sales growth were positive, home comp store sales growth outperformed apparel comp store sales growth for fiscal 2025. Geographically, comp store sales growth was positive across all regions.\nSegment Profit Margin \nSegment profit margin increased to 14.1% for fiscal 2025 compared to a segment profit margin of 13.8% for fiscal 2024. The increase in segment profit margin was primarily driven by higher merchandise margin, partially offset by incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher occupancy and administrative costs. Merchandise margin reflects higher markon and lower inventory shrink expense.\nOur Marmaxx e-commerce sites, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com, together with sierra.com, represented less than 3% of Marmaxx’s net sales for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, and did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons. \nIn fiscal 2026, we expect to open 40 Marmaxx net new stores and approximately 20 new Sierra stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.\n33\nHomeGoods\n  \nFiscal Year Ended\nU.S. dollars in millions\nFebruary 1,\n2025\nFebruary 3,\n2024\n(53 weeks)\nNet sales\n$\n9,386\n \n$\n8,990 \nSegment profit\n$\n1,021\n \n$\n861 \nSegment profit margin\n10.9\n \n%\n9.6 \n%\nComp store sales\n4\n \n%\n3 \n%\nStores in operation at end of period:\nHomeGoods\n943\n \n919 \nHomesense\n72\n \n55 \nTotal\n1,015\n \n974 \nSelling square footage at end of period (in millions):\nHomeGoods\n17\n \n17 \nHomesense\n2\n \n1 \nTotal\n19\n \n18 \nNet Sales\nNet sales for HomeGoods were $9.4 billion for fiscal 2025, an increase of 4%, compared to $9.0 billion for fiscal 2024. \nThe increase \nin net sales reflects a 4% increase from comp store sales and a 2% increase from non-comp store sales, partially offset by a negative 2% estimated year-over-year impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024.\nThe increase in comp store sales for fiscal 2025 reflected an increase in customer transactions, partially offset by a decrease in average basket. Geographically, comp store sales growth was strongest in the West and Midwest regions.\nSegment Profit Margin\nSegment profit margin increased to 10.9% for fiscal 2025 compared to a segment profit margin of 9.6% for fiscal 2024. The increase in segment profit margin for fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by higher merchandise margin and the year-over-year benefit from closing HomeGoods’ e-commerce business last year, partially offset by incremental store wage and payroll costs. Merchandise margin reflects lower freight costs and higher markon.\nIn fiscal 2026, we expect to open 30 new HomeGoods stores, of which 9 are expected to be Homesense stores. This would increase selling square footage by approximately 3%.\n34\nFOREIGN SEGMENTS \nTJX Canada\n  \nFiscal Year Ended\nU.S. dollars in millions\nFebruary 1,\n2025\nFebruary 3,\n2024\n(53 weeks)\nNet sales\n$\n5,189\n \n$\n5,046 \nSegment profit\n$\n703\n \n$\n715 \nSegment profit margin\n13.5\n \n%\n14.2 \n%\nComp store sales\n5\n \n%\n3 \n%\nStores in operation at end of period:\nWinners\n307\n \n302 \nHomeSense\n160\n \n158 \nMarshalls\n109\n \n106 \nTotal\n576\n \n566 \nSelling square footage at end of period (in millions):\nWinners\n7\n \n7 \nHomeSense\n3\n \n3 \nMarshalls\n2\n \n2 \nTotal\n12\n \n12 \nNet Sales\nNet sales for TJX Canada were $5.2 billion for fiscal 2025, an increase of 3% compared to $5.0 billion for fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales reflects a 5% increase in comp store sales and a 2% increase in non-comp store sales, partially offset by a negative foreign currency exchange rate impact of 2% and a negative 2% estimated year-over-year impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. The increase in comp store sales was driven by an increase in customer transactions.\nSegment Profit Margin  \nSegment profit margin decreased to 13.5% for fiscal 2025 compared to a segment profit margin of 14.2% for fiscal 2024. The decrease for fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by incremental store wage and payroll costs, third-party supply chain exit costs this year, and the unfavorable year-over-year impact related to an insurance claim recovery last year.\nIn fiscal 2026, we expect to open 12 new stores in Canada, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.\n35\nTJX International\n  \nFiscal Year Ended\nU.S. dollars in millions\nFebruary 1,\n2025\nFebruary 3,\n2024\n(53 weeks)\nNet sales\n$\n7,181\n \n$\n6,768 \nSegment profit\n$\n422\n \n$\n332 \nSegment profit margin\n5.9\n \n%\n4.9 \n%\nComp store sales\n4\n \n%\n3 \n%\nStores in operation at end of period:\nTK Maxx\n655\n \n644 \nHomesense\n75\n \n79 \nTK Maxx Australia\n84\n \n80 \nTotal\n814\n \n803 \nSelling square footage at end of period (in millions):\nTK Maxx\n13\n \n13 \nHomesense\n1\n \n1 \nTK Maxx Australia\n1\n \n1 \nTotal\n15\n \n15 \nNet Sales\nNet sales for TJX International were $7.2 billion for fiscal 2025, an increase of 6% compared to $6.8 billion for fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales reflects a 4% increase in comp store sales, a 3% increase from non-comp store sales and a positive foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1%, partially offset by a negative 2% estimated year-over-year impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. The increase in comp store sales was driven by an increase in customer transactions.\nE-commerce sales represented less than 4% of TJX International’s net sales for both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024.\nSegment Profit Margin\nSegment profit margin increased to 5.9% for fiscal 2025 compared to a segment profit margin of 4.9% for fiscal 2024. This increase was due to higher merchandise margin, a favorable year-over-year impact from a prior year reserve related to a German COVID program receivable, partially offset by incremental store wage costs. Merchandise margin reflects higher markon and lower markdowns.\nIn fiscal 2026, we expect to open 22 net new stores in Europe and 6 new stores in Australia, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 3%.\nGENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE\n  \nFiscal Year Ended\nIn millions\nFebruary 1,\n2025\nFebruary 3,\n2024\n(53 weeks)\nGeneral corporate expense\n$\n739\n \n$\n708 \nGeneral corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our segments. General corporate expenses are primarily included in SG&A expenses. The mark-to-market adjustment of our fuel and inventory hedges is included in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs. \nThe increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by other administrative costs and share-based compensation costs, partially offset by the favorable year-over-year impacts related to the mark-to-market adjustments on inventory hedges.\n36\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. As of February 1, 2025, there were no short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, under which facilities we have $1.5 billion available as of the period ended February 1, 2025, as described in Note J—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, are adequate to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future. \nAs of February 1, 2025, we held $5.3 billion in cash. Approximately $1.4 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with $875 million held in countries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings. We have provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in Canada, Puerto Rico, Italy, India, Hong Kong and Vietnam through February 1, 2025. If we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid.\nWe monitor debt financing markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may incur additional long-term indebtedness depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions and other factors. Periodically, we have used, and in the future we may again use, operating cash flow and cash on hand to repay portions of our indebtedness, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors. As such, we may, from time to time, seek to retire, redeem, prepay or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions, cash purchases, prepayments, refinancings and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. If we use our operating cash flow and/or cash on hand to repay our debt, it will reduce the amount of cash available for additional capital expenditures. \nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $6.1 billion in both fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. Our operating cash flows increased by $59 million compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to a $390 million increase in net income, partially offset by a $215 million decrease in accrued expenses reflecting lower incentive compensation costs.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities resulted in net cash outflows of $2.5 billion in fiscal 2025 and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2024. The cash outflows for both periods were primarily driven by capital expenditures. In addition, fiscal 2025 cash outflows include the purchase of our equity method investments related to our joint venture with Grupo Axo and a minority ownership position in BFL.\nNet cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two fiscal years as set forth in the table below:\n  \nFiscal Year Ended\nIn millions\nFebruary 1,\n2025\nFebruary 3,\n2024\nNew stores\n$\n176\n \n$\n153 \nStore renovations and improvements\n788\n \n725 \nOffice and distribution centers\n954\n \n844 \nTotal capital expenditures\n$\n1,918\n \n$\n1,722 \nWe expect our capital expenditures in fiscal \n2026\n will be in the range of approximately \n$2.1 billion\n to\n $2.2 billion,\n including approximat\nely $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion \nfor our offices and distribution centers (including information technology systems) to support growth, approximatel\ny $0.9 billion \nfor store renovations and approximatel\ny $0.2 billion \nfor new stores. We plan to fund these expenditures with our existing cash balances and through internally generated funds.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement for a joint venture with Axo to hold a 49% ownership stake in MOS, Axo’s off-price, physical store business in Mexico. We have the option to increase our ownership interest in the joint venture over the long term. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed this investment for $193 million, which includes a purchase price of $179 million and acquisition costs of $14 million. We and Axo both expect to make additional future investments in the joint venture to support the expected growth of the business.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to make an investment for a 35% ownership stake in privately held BFL, representing a non-controlling, minority position. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed this investment for $358 million, which includes a purchase price of $344 million and acquisition costs of $14 million.\n37\nWe funded these expenditures and investments with our existing cash balances and through internally generated funds.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $3.8 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to net cash outflows of $4.2 billion in fiscal 2024. The cash outflows for both periods were primarily driven by equity repurchases and dividend payments.\nDebt\nThe cash outflows in fiscal 2024 were due to the repayment of our $500 million 2.500% ten-year Notes due May 2023 during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. For further information regarding long-term debt, see Note J—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nEquity\nUnder our stock repurchase program, we paid $2.5 billion to repurchase and retire 22.3 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2025. We paid $2.5 billion to repurchase and retire 29 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2024.\nIn February 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $2.5 billion of our common stock from time to time. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2026. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements, and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change. As of February 1, 2025, approximately $3.6 billion remained available under our existing stock repurchase programs. For further information regarding equity repurchases, see Note D—Capital Stock and Earnings Per Share of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nWe declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $1.50 per share in fiscal 2025 and $1.33 per share in fiscal 2024. Cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $1.6 billion for fiscal 2025 and $1.5 billion for fiscal 2024. We expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2026 of $0.425 per share, or an annual dividend of $1.70 per share, subject to the declaration and approval by our Board of Directors. This would represent a 13% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2025.\nContractual Obligations \nSee the descriptions of our financing arrangements, commitments and contingencies, and contractual obligations outlined below and within the following Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n–\nSee Note J—Long-Term Debt and Credit Lines of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for future payments under long-term debt arrangements (including current installments).\n–\nSee Note L—Leases of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating lease liabilities exclude legally binding minimum lease payments for approximately 150 leases signed but not yet commenced and include options to extend lease terms that are now deemed reasonably certain of being exercised according to our Lease Accounting Policy. The balances do not include variable costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rent payments based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2025.\n–\nSee Note M—Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities, Current and Long Term of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid, which includes $0.7 billion for employee compensation and benefits and $0.2 billion for uncertain tax positions.\n–\nWe also have non-cancellable purchase obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements.\n38\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP which requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. These judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. We consider our most critical accounting estimates, involving uncertainty requiring management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below.\nInventory Valuation\nWe use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except TK Maxx in Australia. The businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). Under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. It involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. Under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. We have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. Inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods; however, we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year-end to determine shrinkage at year-end. We do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory.\nReserves for Uncertain Tax Positions\nSimilar to many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, and such authorities may challenge positions we take. We are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. The outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. However, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expiration of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. Final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.\nLoss Contingencies\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the Consolidated Financial Statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. Such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the Consolidated Financial Statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor a discussion of any new accounting pronouncements, see Note A—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n39",
