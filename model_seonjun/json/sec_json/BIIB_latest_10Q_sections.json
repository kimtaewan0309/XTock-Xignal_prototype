Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n in our 2024 Form 10-K. \nITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are subject to certain risks that may affect our results of operations, cash flow and fair values of assets and liabilities, including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate movements and equity price exposure as well as changes in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the military conflict in the Middle East. We manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates through various financial instruments, including derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate lock contracts and interest rate swap contracts. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions, and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty.  \nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK\nOur results of operations are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. As a result, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flow can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc.\nWhile the financial results of our global activities are reported in U.S. dollars, the functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currency. Fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in ways that are difficult to predict. In particular, as the U.S. dollar strengthens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenue will decline when reported in U.S. dollars. The impact to net income as a result of a strengthening U.S. dollar will be partially mitigated by the value of non-U.S. expense, which will also decline when reported in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenue and expense will increase when reported in U.S. dollars.\nWe have established revenue and operating expense hedging and balance sheet risk management programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flow and changes in fair value caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018 the International Practices Task Force of the Center for Audit Quality categorized Argentina as a country with a projected three-year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100.0%, which indicated that Argentina's economy is highly inflationary. This categorization did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position as of September 30, 2025, and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position in the future.\n84\nTable of Contents\nREVENUE AND OPERATING EXPENSE HEDGING PROGRAM\nOur foreign currency hedging program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact resulting from volatility in exchange rate changes on revenue and operating expense. We use foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options to manage foreign currency risk, with the majority of our forward contracts and options used to hedge certain forecasted revenue and operating expense transactions denominated in foreign currencies in the next 24 months. We do not engage in currency speculation. For a more detailed disclosure of our revenue and operating expense hedging program, please read \nNote 10, Derivative Instruments,\n to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. \nOur ability to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on revenue and net income diminishes as significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are sustained over extended periods of time. In particular, devaluation or significant deterioration of foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to mitigate and likely to negatively impact earnings. The cash flow from these contracts are reported as operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flow.\nBALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT HEDGING PROGRAM\nWe also use forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure related to certain balance sheet items. The primary objective of our balance sheet risk management program is to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency denominated net monetary assets and liabilities of foreign affiliates. In these instances, we principally utilize currency forward contracts. We have not elected hedge accounting for the balance sheet related items. The cash flow from these contracts are reported as operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flow.\nThe following quantitative information includes the impact of currency movements on forward contracts used in our revenue, operating expense and balance sheet hedging programs. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, a hypothetical adverse 10.0% movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar across all maturities would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately $289.4 million and $191.7 million, respectively. The estimated fair value change was determined by measuring the impact of the hypothetical exchange rate movement on outstanding forward contracts. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments is subject to assumptions and the actual impact could be significantly different. The quantitative information about market risk is limited because it does not take into account all foreign currency operating transactions.\nCREDIT RISK\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives and accounts receivable. We attempt to minimize the risks related to cash and cash equivalents and investments by investing in a broad and diverse range of financial instruments. We have established guidelines related to credit ratings and maturities intended to safeguard principal balances and maintain liquidity. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. We minimize credit risk resulting from derivative instruments by choosing only highly rated financial institutions as counterparties.\nWe operate in certain countries where weakness in economic conditions, including the effects of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the military conflict in the Middle East, can result in extended collection periods. We continue to monitor these conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies and the relevant financial markets, and assess their possible impact on our business. To date, we have not experienced any significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable.\nWe believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n85\nTable of Contents\nITEM 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nWe have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of September 30, 2025. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that:\n(a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms; and \n(b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2025, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n86\nTable of Contents\nPART II OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a discussion of legal proceedings as of September 30, 2025, please read \nNote 21, Litigation,\n to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report, which is incorporated into this item by reference.\nITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are substantially dependent on revenue from our products. \nOur revenue depends upon continued sales of our products as well as the financial rights we have in our anti-CD20 therapeutic programs. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated on sales of our products in increasingly competitive markets. Any of the following negative developments relating to any of our products or any of our anti-CD20 therapeutic programs may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations or our stock price: \n•\nthe introduction, greater acceptance or more favorable reimbursement of competing products, including new originator therapies, generics, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways;\n•\nsafety or efficacy issues;\n•\nlimitations and additional pressures on product pricing or price increases, including those relating to inflation and those resulting from governmental or regulatory requirements, including those relating to any future potential drug price negotiation under the IRA or other legislative or executive acts; increased competition, including from generic or biosimilar versions of our products; or changes in, or implementation of, reimbursement policies and practices of payors and other third parties;\n•\nadverse legal, administrative, geopolitical, regulatory or legislative developments; and\n•\nour ability to maintain a positive reputation among patients, healthcare providers and others, which may be impacted by our pricing and reimbursement decisions.\nLEQEMBI is in the early stages of commercial launch in the U.S. and certain international markets and SKYCLARYS is in the early stages of commercial launch in certain European markets. In addition to risks associated with new product launches and the other factors described in these Risk Factors, Biogen’s and Eisai’s ability to successfully commercialize LEQEMBI and our ability to successfully commercialize SKYCLARYS may be adversely affected due to:\n•\nEisai’s ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement for LEQEMBI;\n•\nthe effectiveness of Eisai's and Biogen’s commercial strategy for marketing LEQEMBI;\n•\nrequirements such as participation in a registry and the use of imaging or other diagnostics for LEQEMBI;\n•\nour ability to obtain approval in other markets;\n•\nthe approval and/or greater acceptance of other new products for the same or similar indications;\n•\nEisai’s and Biogen’s ability to maintain a positive reputation among patients, healthcare providers and others in the Alzheimer’s disease community, which may be impacted by pricing and reimbursement decisions relating to LEQEMBI, which are made by Eisai and/or third parties;\n•\nBiogen's ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement for SKYCLARYS; and\n•\nthe effectiveness of Biogen's commercial strategy for marketing SKYCLARYS.\nOur long-term success depends upon the successful development of new products and additional indications for our existing products.\nOur long-term success depends upon the successful development of new products from our research and development activities or our licenses or acquisitions from third parties, as well as the development of additional indications for our existing products. Product development is very expensive and involves a high degree of uncertainty and risk and is not always successful. Only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. It is difficult to predict the success and the time and cost of product development of novel approaches for the treatment of diseases. The development of novel approaches for the treatment of diseases, including development efforts in new modalities such as those based on the ASO platform and gene therapy, presents additional challenges and risks, including obtaining approval from regulatory authorities that have limited experience with the development of such therapies. For example, we are currently seeking approval \n87\nTable of Contents\nof a subcutaneous formulation of LEQEMBI as a starting dose in the U.S. and any delays or challenges may impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from LEQEMBI.\nClinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and even if we view data as sufficient to support the safety, effectiveness and/or approval of a product candidate, regulatory authorities may disagree and may require additional data, limit the scope of the approval or deny approval altogether. Furthermore, the approval of a product candidate by one regulatory agency does not mean that other regulatory agencies will also approve such product candidate.\nSuccess in preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful. Clinical trials may indicate that our product candidates lack efficacy, have harmful side effects, result in unexpected adverse events or raise other concerns that may significantly reduce or delay the likelihood of regulatory approval. This may result in terminated programs, significant restrictions on use, safety warnings in an approved label, adverse placement within the treatment paradigm or significant reduction in the commercial potential of the product candidate.\nEven if we could successfully develop new products or additional indications for our existing products, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of a product candidate or an additional indication for our existing products if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to the standard of care or we prioritize other opportunities in our pipeline.\nIf we fail to compete effectively, our business and market position would suffer.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We compete in the marketing and sale of our products, the development of new products and processes, the acquisition of rights to new products with commercial potential and the hiring and retention of personnel. We compete with companies that have a greater number of products on the market and in the product pipeline, substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources, and other technological or competitive advantages. \nOur products continue to face increasing competition from the introduction of new originator therapies, generics, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Some of these products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than our branded products. The introduction of such products as well as other lower-priced competing products has in the past reduced, and may in the future significantly reduce, both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell, which has and may continue to negatively impact our revenue. In addition, in some markets, when a generic or biosimilar version of one of our products is commercialized, it has in the past and may in the future be automatically substituted for our product and significantly reduce our revenue in a short period of time.\nOur ability to compete, maintain and grow our business may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n•\nthe introduction of other products, including products that may be more efficacious, safer, less expensive or more convenient alternatives to our products, including our own products and products of our collaborators;\n•\nthe off-label use by physicians of therapies indicated for other conditions to treat patients; \n•\npatient dynamics, including the size of the patient population and our ability to identify, attract and maintain new and current patients to our therapies;\n•\nthe reluctance of physicians to prescribe, and patients to use, our products without additional data on the efficacy and safety of such products;\n•\ndamage to physician and patient confidence in any of our products, generic or biosimilars of our products or any other product from the same class as one of our products, or to our sales and reputation as a result of label changes, pricing and reimbursement decisions or adverse experiences or events that may occur with patients treated with our products or generic or biosimilars of our products;\n•\ninability to obtain and maintain appropriate pricing and adequate reimbursement for our products compared to our competitors in key markets; and\n•\nour ability to obtain and maintain patent, data or market exclusivity for our products.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute or realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic and growth initiatives.\nThe successful execution of our strategic and growth initiatives depends upon internal development projects, commercial initiatives and external opportunities, which may include the acquisition and in-licensing of products, technologies, companies, the entry into strategic alliances and collaborations or our Fit for Growth program, as well as our ability to execute on strategic decisions and initiatives.\n88\nTable of Contents\nWhile we believe we have a number of promising programs in our pipeline, failure or delay of internal development projects to advance or difficulties in executing on our commercial initiatives could impact our current and future growth, resulting in additional reliance on external development opportunities for growth. \nSupporting the further development of our existing products and potential new products in our pipeline will require significant capital expenditures and management resources, including investments in research and development, sales and marketing, manufacturing capabilities and other areas of our business.\nWe have made, and may continue to make, significant operating and capital expenditures for potential new products prior to regulatory approval with no assurance that such investment will be recouped, which may adversely affect our financial condition, business and operations.\nThe availability of high quality, fairly valued external product development is limited and the opportunity to acquire or in-license is highly competitive. As such, we are not certain that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for acquisition or in-licensing or if we will be able to reach agreement to make any such acquisition or in-license if suitable candidates are identified.\nWe may fail to initiate or complete transactions for many reasons, including failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals as well as a result of disputes or litigation. Furthermore, we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from transactions, collaborations or strategic decisions, such as the decision to retain the biosimilars business, or the benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. We may also face additional costs or liabilities in completed transactions that were not contemplated prior to completion.\nAny failure in the execution of a transaction, in the integration of an acquired asset or business or in achieving expected synergies could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the recording of asset impairment charges and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with our Fit for Growth program that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated savings and operational efficiencies or that may otherwise harm our business. These risks include delays in implementation of cost optimization actions, loss of workforce capabilities, higher than anticipated separation expenses, litigation and the failure to meet financial and operational targets. In addition, the calculation of the anticipated cost savings and other benefits resulting from our Fit for Growth program are subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. \nI\nf these estimates and assumptions are incorrect or if we experience delays or unforeseen events, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nSales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on the availability and extent of adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, which are subject to increasing and intense pressure from political, social, competitive and other sources. Our inability to obtain and maintain adequate coverage, or a reduction in pricing or reimbursement, could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenue and results of operations.\nSales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on the availability and extent of adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from governmental health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. When a new pharmaceutical product is approved, the availability of government and private reimbursement for that product, diagnosis of the condition it treats and the cost to administer it may be uncertain, as is the pricing and amount for which that product will be reimbursed. \nPricing and reimbursement for our products may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n•\nchanges in, and implementation of, federal, state or foreign government regulations or private third-party payors’ reimbursement policies;\n•\npressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs;\n•\nconsolidation and increasing assertiveness of governmental health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations seeking price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived value;\n•\nour ability to receive reimbursement for our products or our ability to receive comparable reimbursement to that of competing products; and\n•\nour value-based contracting program pursuant to which we aim to tie the pricing of our products to their clinical values by either aligning price to patient outcomes or adjusting price for patients who discontinue therapy for any reason, including efficacy or tolerability concerns.\n89\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to set the price for our products varies significantly from country to country and, as a result, so can the price of our products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). Drug prices are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are prescribed; for example the IRA has certain provisions related to drug pricing, including the ability for the U.S. government to set prices for certain drugs in Medicare. We expect drug pricing and other healthcare costs to continue to be subject to political or societal pressures on a global basis. Certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. Our inability to obtain and maintain adequate prices in a particular country has limited, and may in the future limit, the revenue from our products within that country and has, and may in the future, also adversely affect our ability to secure acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets, which has limited, and may in the future limit, market growth and result in reductions in revenue. This has created, or may create, the opportunity for third-party cross-border trade or influence our decision to sell or not to sell a product, thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans and revenue. Additionally, in certain jurisdictions governmental health agencies are permitted to adjust, retroactively and/or prospectively, reimbursement rates for our products. Reimbursement for our products by governments, including the timing of any reimbursements, are also affected by budgetary or political constraints, particularly in challenging economic environments. Government agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore, have limited control over the amount of money they can spend. In addition, these agencies experience political pressure that dictate the manner in which they spend money. There can be no assurance that the economic, budgeting or political issues will not worsen and adversely impact sales or reimbursements of our products.\nCompetition from current and future competitors has and may continue to negatively impact our ability to maintain pricing and our market share. New products marketed by our competitors have caused and could continue to cause our revenue to decrease due to potential price reductions and lower sales volumes. Additionally, the introduction of generic or biosimilar versions of our products, follow-on products, prodrugs or products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways has and may significantly reduce the price and the volume of products we sell.\nMany third-party payors continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients, including more limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pay or co-insurance obligations and limitations on patients' use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs). Significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and pharmacy benefit managers exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. Further consolidation among insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and other payors would increase the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers. Additional discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenue and results of operations, could curtail or eliminate our ability to adequately fund research and development programs and/or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price.\nWe depend on relationships with collaborators and other third parties for revenue, and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates, which are outside of our full control, and if these relationships fail, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on a number of collaborative and other third-party relationships for revenue and the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates. We also outsource certain aspects of our regulatory affairs and clinical development relating to our products and product candidates to third parties. Reliance on third parties subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n•\nwe may be unable to control the resources our collaborators or third parties devote to our programs, products or product candidates, which may affect our ability to achieve development goals or milestones;\n•\ndisputes may arise under an agreement, including with respect to the achievement and payment of milestones, payment of development or commercial costs, ownership of rights to technology developed, and the underlying agreement may fail to provide us with significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if the collaborators or third parties fail to perform; \n•\nthe interests of our collaborators or third parties may not always align with our interests, and such parties may not protect and enforce any intellectual property rights or pursue regulatory approvals or market a product in the same manner or to the same extent that we would, which could adversely affect our revenue, or may adopt tax strategies that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition; \n90\nTable of Contents\n•\nthe inability of the parties to cooperate effectively, which could adversely affect product sales or the clinical development or regulatory approvals of product candidates under joint control, could result in termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates or could result in litigation or arbitration;\n•\nany failure on the part of our collaborators or third parties to comply with applicable laws, including tax laws, regulatory requirements and/or applicable contractual obligations or to fulfill any responsibilities they may have to protect and enforce any intellectual property rights underlying our products could have an adverse effect on our revenue or reputation as well as involve us in possible legal proceedings; \n•\ndisruptions, turnover or changes in strategy, priorities or capabilities at our collaborators resulting from, for example, a change in control, may impact the commercialization or manufacturing of our shared products and may result in loss of revenue or higher operating expense; and\n•\nany improper conduct or actions on the part of our collaborators or third parties could subject us to civil or criminal investigations and monetary and injunctive penalties, require management attention, impact the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting and/or adversely impact our business and our reputation.\nGiven these risks, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed, revenue from products could decline and/or we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these arrangements.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms including those contained in the PPACA, IRA, OBBBA and executive orders.\nIn the U.S., federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payors continue to focus on the cost of healthcare. Legislative and regulatory proposals, enactments to reform healthcare insurance programs (including those in the IRA and OBBBA) and increasing pressure from social sources could significantly influence the manner in which our products are prescribed, purchased and reimbursed. For example, provisions of the PPACA have resulted in changes in the way healthcare is paid for by both governmental and private insurers, including increased rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, the requirement that manufacturers participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under Medicare Part D and under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act and similar state legislation. These changes have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our business. \nIn July 2025 the U.S. signed into law the OBBBA, which enacts significant potential changes to Medicaid funding and rescinds or does not continue elements of the PPACA. The OBBBA implements additional eligibility rules on government health plans, expands administrative procedures around enrollment, modifies how states can obtain federal funding for Medicaid and no longer extends ACA premium subsidies. Additional federal and state guidance is expected to be issued in order to implement these OBBBA provisions, most of which have effective dates in 2027 and 2028. At this time, we are unable to determine the overall impact that the OBBBA will have on our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the impact the OBBBA will have on the pharmaceutical industry as a whole because any such impact will depend upon developing interpretations of the OBBBA provisions and implementing regulations, which may be material.\nWe may face uncertainties as a result of efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. There is no assurance that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nThere is substantial public attention on the costs of prescription drugs and we expect drug pricing and other healthcare costs to continue to be subject to political and societal pressures globally. In addition, there have been, and are expected to continue to be, legislative proposals to address prescription drug pricing. We face uncertainties regarding potential healthcare reforms, governmental policy and prioritization. The uncertainty about the future of the PPACA and healthcare laws may put downward pressure on drug pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. For example, we expect the IRA's drug pricing controls and Medicare Part D redesign to have an adverse impact on sales, particularly for our products that are more substantially reliant on Medicare reimbursement.\nAdditionally, the current government administration has introduced various measures to address prescription drug pricing and access, including through issuance of an executive order aiming to establish a MFN drug pricing policy that would tie U.S. drug prices to the prices paid for drugs in other countries. If HHS sets MFN pricing targets for prescription drugs, including the use of international pricing reference to set drug prices in the U.S., or if legislation is passed enabling generic drug or biosimilar entry sooner than expected, our business could be materially harmed, including with respect to our ability to set adequate pricing for new drugs to recover our research and development costs. The timing and extent of implementation of any of the measures described above is uncertain and we cannot fully predict their impact on our product candidates and our business. The adoption of these and any other \n91\nTable of Contents\ngovernment controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our product candidates from coverage, limit payments for pharmaceuticals, limit our ability to launch products in certain markets and impact healthcare systems and drug markets in the U.S. and abroad, thereby negatively affecting our revenue and adversely impacting our business.\nThere is also significant economic pressure on state budgets, that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our drugs. Some states have considered legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices of drugs, including laws to allow importation of pharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside the U.S. and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases. State Medicaid programs are requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expense may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding limitation on prices and reimbursement for our products. \nIn the E.U. and some other international markets, the government provides healthcare at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Many countries have announced or implemented measures, and may in the future implement new or additional measures, to reduce healthcare costs to limit the overall level of government expenditures. These measures vary by country and may include, among other things, patient access restrictions, suspensions on price increases, prospective and possible retroactive price reductions and other recoupments and increased mandatory discounts or rebates, recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries. These measures have negatively impacted our revenue and may continue to adversely affect our revenue and results of operations in the future.\nOur success in commercializing biosimilars is subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in the development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilars. If we are unsuccessful in such activities, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilar products require specialized expertise and are very costly and subject to complex regulation. Our success in commercializing biosimilars is subject to a number of risks, including:\n•\nReliance on Third Parties.\n We are dependent, in part, on the efforts of collaboration partners and other third parties for the development and manufacturing of biosimilars products. These third parties are independent entities subject to their own unique operational, strategic and financial risks that are outside of our control and may be affected by events outside of our control. For example, one of our contract manufacturers for IMRALDI and BENEPALI was acquired by a third party in December 2024 which may impact the contract manufacturer's operational, strategic or financial risk. If these third parties fail to perform successfully, or reduce their third party manufacturing production, our biosimilar product development or commercialization of biosimilar products could be delayed, revenue from biosimilar products could decline and/or we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these arrangements;\n•\nCompetitive Challenges.\n Biosimilar products face significant competition, including from innovator products and biosimilar products offered by other companies that may receive greater acceptance or more favorable reimbursement. Local tendering processes may restrict biosimilar products from being marketed and sold in some jurisdictions. The number of competitors in a jurisdiction, the timing of approval and the ability to market biosimilar products successfully in a timely and cost-effective manner are additional factors that may impact our success in this business area;\n•\nRegulatory Compliance.\n Biosimilar products may face regulatory hurdles or delays due to the evolving and uncertain regulatory and commercial pathway of biosimilars products in certain jurisdictions;\n•\nAbility to Provide Adequate Supply.\n Manufacturing biosimilars is complex. If we encounter any persistent manufacturing or supply chain difficulties we may be unable to meet demand. We are dependent on a third-party for the manufacture of our biosimilar products and such third-party may not perform its obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner or in compliance with applicable regulations and may be unable or unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our existing or future biosimilar products;\n•\nIntellectual Property and Regulatory Challenges.\n Biosimilar products may face extensive intellectual property clearances and infringement litigation, injunctions or regulatory challenges, which could prevent the commercial launch of a product or delay it for many years or result in imposition of monetary damages, penalties or other civil sanctions and damage our reputation; and\n92\nTable of Contents\n•\nFailure to Gain Market and Patient Acceptance.\n Market success of biosimilar products will be adversely affected if patients, physicians and/or payors do not accept biosimilar products as safe and efficacious products offering a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our data, intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business may be harmed. \nOur success, including our long-term viability and growth, depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and defend patent and other intellectual property rights, including certain regulatory forms of exclusivity, that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. Patent protection and/or regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. and other important markets remains uncertain and depends, in part, upon decisions of the patent offices, courts, administrative bodies and lawmakers in these countries. We may fail to obtain, defend or preserve patent and other intellectual property rights, including certain regulatory forms of exclusivity, or the protection we obtain may not be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all countries where we conduct business, which could result in financial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price. In addition, settlements of such proceedings often result in reducing the period of exclusivity and other protections, resulting in a reduction in revenue from affected products.\nIn many markets, including the U.S., manufacturers may be allowed to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator's product and do not need to conduct clinical trials before marketing a competing version of a product after there is no longer patent or regulatory exclusivity. In such cases, manufacturers often charge significantly lower prices and a major portion of the company's revenue may be reduced in a short period of time. In addition, manufacturers of generics and biosimilars may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or other intellectual property protections.\nFurthermore, our products may be determined to infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. Legal proceedings, administrative challenges or other types of proceedings are and may in the future be necessary to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Legal proceedings may also be necessary to determine the rights, obligations and payments claimed during and after the expiration of intellectual property license agreements we have entered with third parties. Such proceedings are unpredictable and are often protracted and expensive. Negative outcomes of such proceedings could hinder or prevent us from manufacturing and marketing our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. A failure to obtain necessary licenses for an infringed product or technology could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain could reduce our profits from the covered products and services. Any of these circumstances could result in financial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.\nRisks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulation of Our Products and Product Candidates\nSuccessful preclinical work or early/late stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage trials, regulatory approval or commercial viability of a product.\nPositive results in preclinical work or early/late stage clinical trials have in the past and may in the future fail to be replicated in subsequent or confirmatory trials. Additionally, success in preclinical work or early/late stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful or that regulatory approval will be obtained. Even if later stage clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may delay or decline approval of our product candidates. Regulatory authorities may disagree with our view of the data, require additional studies, disagree with our trial design or endpoints. Regulatory authorities may also fail to approve the facilities or processes used to manufacture a product candidate, our dosing or delivery methods or companion devices. Regulatory authorities have in the past and may in the future grant marketing approval that is more restricted than anticipated, including limiting indications to narrow patient populations and the imposition of safety monitoring, educational requirements, requiring confirmatory trials and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The occurrence of any of these events could result in significant costs and expense, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and/or cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.\nClinical trials and the development of biopharmaceutical products is a lengthy and complex process. If we fail to adequately manage our clinical activities, our clinical trials or potential regulatory approvals may be delayed or denied.\nConducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. Our ability to complete clinical trials in a timely fashion depends on a number of key factors, including protocol design, regulatory and institutional review \n93\nTable of Contents\nboard approval, patient enrollment rates and compliance with current Good Clinical Practices. If we or our third-party clinical trial providers or third-party CROs do not successfully carry out these clinical activities, our clinical trials or the potential regulatory approval of a product candidate may be delayed or denied.\nWe have opened clinical trial sites and are enrolling patients in a number of countries where our experience is limited. In most cases, we use the services of third parties to carry out our clinical trial related activities and rely on such parties to accurately report their results. Our reliance on third parties for these activities may impact our ability to control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials. One CRO has responsibility for a substantial portion of our activities and reporting related to our clinical trials and if such CRO does not adequately perform, many of our trials may be significantly affected, including adversely affecting our expenses associated with such trials. We may need to replace our CROs, which may result in the delay of the affected trials or otherwise adversely affect our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize our product candidates.\nAdverse safety events or restrictions on use and safety warnings for our products can negatively affect our business, product sales and stock price.\nAdverse safety events involving our products, generic or biosimilar versions of our products or products from the same class as one of our products may have a negative impact on our business. Discovery of safety issues with our products could create product liability and have or could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling or safety monitoring, withdrawal of products from the market and/or the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. Adverse safety events may also damage physician, patient and/or investor confidence in our products and our reputation. Any of these could result in adverse impacts on our results of operations. \nRegulatory authorities are making greater amounts of stand-alone safety information directly available to the public through periodic safety update reports, patient registries and other reporting requirements. The reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or products similar to ours and public rumors about such events may increase claims against us and may also cause our product sales to decline or lead to periods of stock price volatility.\nRestrictions on use or safety warnings that may be required to be included in the label of our products may significantly reduce expected revenue for those products or require significant expense or divert management time.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nA breakdown or breach of our information systems could subject us to liability or interrupt our business operations.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information systems and data to operate our business. Changes in how we operate have caused us to modify our business practices in ways that heighten this dependence, including changing the requirement that most of our office-based employees in the U.S. and our other key markets work from the office, with many of our employees now working in hybrid or full-remote positions. As a result, we are increasingly dependent upon our information systems to operate our business and our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of our information systems and data, which includes use of cloud technologies, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Breakdowns, invasions, corruptions, destructions and/or breaches, which may include impacts such as, but not limited to, comprising the capacity, reliability or security of our information systems or those of our business partners, including our cloud technologies, and/or unauthorized access to our data and information could subject us to significant liability, negatively impact our business operations, and/or require replacement of technology and/or sizeable ransom payments. Our information systems, including our cloud technologies, continue to increase in multitude and complexity, increasing our vulnerability when breakdowns, malicious intrusions and random attacks occur. Data privacy or security breaches also pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public.\nCybersecurity threats and incidents are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, particularly when they impact vendors, customers or suppliers, and other companies in our supply chain. Cybersecurity threats and incidents are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent threat actors, including nation states, organized crime groups, “hacktivists” and may include or target employees or contractors acting with careless or malicious intent. Recent developments in the threat landscape include use of adversarial AI techniques and machine learning, as well as an increased number of cyber extortion attacks, with higher financial ransom demand amounts and increasing sophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and methodology. Geopolitical instability may increase the risk of cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity threats or incidents may include deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, a denial-of-service attack, a malicious website, the use of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information systems and data. Cybersecurity threats and incidents also include manufacturing, hardware or software supply chain attacks, which could cause a delay in the manufacturing of products or products \n94\nTable of Contents\nproduced for contract manufacturing or lead to a data privacy or security breach. Our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. In addition, our increased use of cloud technologies heightens these and other operational risks, and any failure by cloud or other technology service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential or propriety information.\nWhile we continue to build and improve our systems and infrastructure, including our business continuity plans, there can be no assurance that our efforts will detect and prevent cybersecurity threats or incidents in our systems and any such incidents could materially adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in material financial, legal, operational or reputational harm to us, loss of competitive advantage or loss of consumer confidence. Our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nRegulations continue to change as regulators worldwide consider new rules. For example, the SEC has adopted additional disclosure rules regarding cyber security risk management, strategy, governance and incident reporting by public companies. These regulations or other regulations being considered in Europe and around the world may impact the manner in which we operate.\nRegulators currently impose new data privacy and security requirements, including monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation established regulations regarding the handling of personal data, and provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance. U.S. data privacy and security laws, such as the CCPA, and others that may be passed, similarly introduce requirements with respect to personal information, and non-compliance with the CCPA may result in liability through private actions (subject to statutorily defined damages in the event of certain data breaches) and enforcement. Failure to comply with these current and future laws, policies, industry standards or legal obligations or any security incident resulting in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause patients, healthcare providers and the general public to lose trust in us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe increasing use of AI-based software presents new risks and challenges and could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nAs with many developing technologies, AI-based software presents risks and challenges. For example, algorithms may be flawed, data sets may be insufficient, of poor quality or contain biased information; and inappropriate or controversial data practices could impair results. The use of AI-based software is increasingly being used in the biopharmaceutical industry, including by us, for research, marketing, manufacturing and commercialization, and we anticipate increasing our usage of technology that uses AI in the future. If the analyses that AI-based software assist in producing are deficient or inaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability and brand or reputational harm. Use of AI-based software internally, by third parties or by threat actors may also lead to cybersecurity risks or the release of confidential proprietary information, including personal data, which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of our intellectual property or violate our internal policies, data protection laws or contractual requirements. The use of AI-based software may also result in unauthorized access of personal data or the intellectual property of third parties. Since the use of AI is subject to new or evolving laws and regulations, compliance may impose operational costs and limit our ability to use AI-based software, and failure to comply may result in potential government actions, litigation, fines, penalties or adverse publicity.\nManufacturing issues could substantially increase our costs, limit supply of our products and/or reduce our revenue.\nThe process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated and subject to numerous risks, including:\n•\nRisks of Reliance on Third Parties and Single Source Providers.\n We rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers for many aspects of our manufacturing process for our products and product candidates. In some cases, due to the unique manner in which our products are manufactured, we rely on single source providers of raw materials and manufacturing supplies. These third parties are independent entities subject to their own unique operational, strategic and financial risks that are outside of our control and may be affected by events outside of our control. Additionally, these third parties may not perform their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner or in compliance with applicable regulations, and they may be unable or unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our existing or future products. Finding alternative providers could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the specialized nature of the services and the need to obtain regulatory approval of any significant changes to our suppliers or manufacturing methods. We cannot be certain that we could reach agreement with alternative providers or that the FDA or other regulatory authorities would approve our use of such alternatives.\n•\nGlobal Bulk Supply Risks. \nWe rely on our manufacturing facilities for the production of drug substance for our large molecule products and product candidates. Our global bulk supply of these products and product \n95\nTable of Contents\ncandidates depends on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities, which could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor or raw material shortages, geopolitical instability, public health epidemics, natural disasters, adverse weather events, power failures, cyber-attacks and many other factors.\n•\nRisks Relating to Compliance with current GMP (cGMP).\n We and our third-party providers are required to maintain compliance with cGMP and other stringent requirements, as applicable, and are subject to inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities to confirm compliance. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or operations or those of third parties to receive regulatory approval or pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions and damage our reputation.\n•\nRisk of Product Loss.\n The manufacturing process for our products is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, oxidation, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or manufacturing facilities, we may need to close our manufacturing facilities for an extended period of time to investigate and remediate the contaminant.\nAny adverse developments affecting our manufacturing operations or the operations of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the commercial supply of our products.\nFurthermore, factors such as geopolitical instability, public health epidemics, natural disasters, adverse weather events, labor or raw material shortages, imposition of tariffs or trade restrictions, power failures, cyber-attacks and other supply chain disruptions could result in difficulties and delays in manufacturing our products, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or result in product shortages. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expense for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share as patients and physicians turn to competing therapeutics, diminish our profitability or damage our reputation. \nIn addition, although we have business continuity plans to reduce the potential for manufacturing disruptions or delays and reduce the severity of a disruptive event, there is no guarantee that these plans will be adequate, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nManagement, personnel and other organizational changes may disrupt our operations, and we may have difficulty retaining personnel or attracting and retaining qualified replacements on a timely basis for the management and other personnel who may leave the Company, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our operations.\nChanges in management, other personnel and our overall retention rate may disrupt our business, and any such disruption could adversely affect our operations, programs, growth, financial condition or results of operations. New members of management may have different perspectives on programs and opportunities for our business, which may cause us to focus on new opportunities or reduce or change emphasis on our existing programs.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel in a highly competitive environment. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract or retain them. We may face difficulty in attracting and retaining talent for a number of reasons, including management changes, integration related to the acquisition of HI-Bio, the underperformance or discontinuation of one or more marketed, pre-clinical or clinical programs, recruitment by competitors or changes in the overall labor market. Changes in our organizational structure or in our flexible working arrangements could also impact productivity and morale as well as our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees. We cannot ensure that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary for our operations or that the loss of any personnel will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the healthcare industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of business.\nOur activities, and the activities of our collaborators, distributors and other third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions, and are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our business practices. The FDA and comparable foreign agencies directly regulate many of our most critical business activities, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting, product risk management and our compliance with good practice quality guidelines and regulations. Our interactions with physicians and other \n96\nTable of Contents\nhealthcare providers that prescribe or purchase our products are also subject to laws and government regulation designed to prevent fraud and abuse in the sale and use of products and place significant restrictions on the marketing practices of healthcare companies. Healthcare companies are facing heightened scrutiny of their relationships with healthcare providers and have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of laws and government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of healthcare business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations or violations related to environmental matters. There is also enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including testing, insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. The U.S. government has challenged some of our donations to third-party charities that provide patient assistance. If we, or our vendors or donation recipients, are found to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or government guidance in the operation of these or other patient assistance programs, we could be subject to significant fines or penalties. Risks relating to compliance with laws and regulations may be heightened as we continue to expand our global operations and enter new therapeutic areas with different patient populations, which may have different product distribution methods, marketing programs or patient assistance programs from those we currently utilize or support. \nConditions and regulations governing the healthcare industry are subject to change, with possible retroactive effect, including:\n•\nnew laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or judicial decisions, related to healthcare availability, pricing or marketing practices, compliance with employment practices, method of delivery, payment for healthcare products and services, compliance with health information and data privacy and security laws and regulations, tracking and reporting payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, extensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption prohibitions, product serialization and labeling requirements and used product take-back requirements; \n•\nchanges and the potential imposition of new or changing standards in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes, staffing, resources or perspectives that may delay or prevent certain processes, including, but not limited to, the approval of new products, product labels and/or formulations and approvals required for manufacturing facilities and may result in lost market opportunity; \n•\ngovernment shutdowns, funding disputes, reorganizations, furloughs or reductions in staffing and/or resources or changes in priorities or focus may result in delays to the review and approval process, slowing the time necessary for new drug candidates and other regulatory matters to be reviewed and/or approved, which may adversely affect our business;\n•\nrequirements that provide for increased transparency of clinical trial results and quality data, such as the EMA's clinical transparency policy, which could impact our ability to protect trade secrets and competitively-sensitive information contained in approval applications or could be misinterpreted leading to reputational damage, misperception or legal action, which could harm our business; and\n•\nchanges in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products.\nAdditionally, conditions and regulations governing the healthcare industry in the U.S. are subject to greater risk of change and uncertainty as a result of changes in legislative and regulatory priorities and personnel.\nViolations of governmental regulation may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as against executives overseeing our business. We could also be required to repay amounts we received from government payors or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we submitted to the government. In addition, legal proceedings and investigations are inherently unpredictable, and large judgments or settlements sometimes occur. While we believe that we have appropriate compliance controls, policies and procedures in place to comply with the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, there is a risk that acts committed by our employees, agents, distributors, collaborators or third-party providers might violate such laws or regulations. Whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation or litigation related to alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expense, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business.\nOur sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.\n97\nTable of Contents\nWe are increasing our presence in international markets, subjecting us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenue. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in international markets will succeed. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability and may have a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices. Certain countries may require local clinical trial data as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents or distributors and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we collaborate with or acquire in emerging markets.\nOur sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including:\n•\nthe impact of public health epidemics on the global economy and the delivery of healthcare treatments;\n•\nless favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws; \n•\nthe inability to obtain necessary foreign regulatory approvals of products in a timely manner; \n•\nlimitations and additional pressures on our ability to obtain and maintain product pricing, reimbursement or receive price increases, including those resulting from governmental or regulatory requirements;\n•\nincreased cost of goods due to factors such as inflation and supply chain disruptions;\n•\nadditional complexity in manufacturing or conducting clinical research internationally, including materials manufactured in China or working with CROs in China;\n•\ndelays in clinical trials relating to geopolitical instability related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the military conflict in the Middle East;\n•\nthe inability to successfully complete subsequent or confirmatory clinical trials in countries where our experience is limited;\n•\nlonger payment and reimbursement cycles and uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable; \n•\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely impact our revenue, net income and value of certain of our investments; \n•\nthe imposition of governmental controls; \n•\ndiverse data privacy and protection requirements;\n•\nincreasingly complex standards for complying with foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may conflict with corresponding U.S. laws and regulations; \n•\nthe anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation across the globe, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and elsewhere and escalation of investigations and prosecutions pursuant to such laws;\n•\ncompliance with complex import and export control laws;\n•\nchanges in tax laws; and\n•\nthe imposition of tariffs or reciprocal tariffs, trade protection measures, embargoes, import or export licensing requirements and the imposition of trade sanctions and other similar restrictions.\nOur international operations are also subject to regulation under U.S. law. For example, the U.S. federal government has initiated Section 232 investigations including with respect to pharmaceutical imports into the U.S. The result of these Section 232 investigations and any subsequent rulemaking could result in the government taking actions such as trade protection measures, embargoes, import or export licensing requirements, the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions, which could have adverse consequences to our business and operations.\nAdditionally, the U.S. FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and damage to our reputation. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could adversely impact our business and financial results. In addition, while we believe that we have appropriate compliance controls, policies and procedures in place to comply with the FCPA, there is a risk that acts committed by our employees, agents, distributors, collaborators or third-party providers might violate the FCPA and we might be held responsible. If our employees, agents, distributors, collaborators or third-party providers are found to have engaged in such practices, \n98\nTable of Contents\nwe could suffer severe penalties and may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe built a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility and are building a gene therapy, clinical packaging and other manufacturing facility, which will result in the incurrence of significant investment with no assurance that such investment will be recouped.\nIn order to support our future growth and drug development pipeline, we have expanded our large molecule production capacity by building a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland with no assurance that the additional capacity will be required or this investment will be recouped.\nAlthough the Solothurn facility was approved by the FDA for LEQEMBI, there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will approve the Solothurn facility for the manufacturing of other products.\nAdditionally, we are building a new gene therapy, clinical packaging and other manufacturing facility as well as modernizing and automating our existing manufacturing facilities in RTP, North Carolina with no assurance that these investments will be fully utilized. \nIf we are unable to fully utilize our manufacturing facilities, our business may be harmed. Charges resulting from excess capacity may occur and would have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or unfit versions of our products or stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nThird parties might illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or unfit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing, distribution and testing standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit or unfit drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or unfit drugs sold under our brand name. Inventory that is stolen from warehouses, plants or while in-transit, and that is subsequently improperly stored and sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about our products and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear and create uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we may fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend the company or the public's legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our products. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on social media. We may also encounter criticism on social media regarding our company, management, product candidates or products. The immediacy of social media precludes us from having real-time control over postings made regarding us via social media, whether matters of fact or opinion. Our reputation could be damaged by the negative publicity generated from false or misleading social media posts concerning us, which we may not be able to reverse. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.\nRisks Related to Holding Our Common Stock\nOur operating results are subject to significant fluctuations.\nOur quarterly revenue, expense and net income have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to the risks described in these \nRisk Factors\n as well as the timing of charges and expense that we may take. We have recorded, or may in the future be required to record, charges that include:\n•\nthe cost of restructurings or other initiatives to streamline our operations and reallocate resources;\n•\nthe costs associated with decisions to terminate research and development programs;\n•\nimpairments with respect to investments, fixed assets and long-lived assets, including IPR&D and other intangible assets; \n•\ninventory write-downs for failed quality specifications, charges for excess capacity, charges for excess or obsolescence and charges for inventory write-downs relating to product suspensions, expirations or recalls; \n•\nchanges in the fair value of contingent consideration or our equity investments;\n•\nbad debt expense and increased bad debt reserves;\n•\noutcomes of litigation and other legal or administrative proceedings, regulatory matters and tax matters;\n99\nTable of Contents\n•\npayments in connection with acquisitions, divestitures and other business development activities and under license and collaboration agreements;\n•\nfailure to meet certain contractual commitments; and\n•\nthe impact of public health epidemics on employees, the global economy and the delivery of healthcare.\nOur revenue and certain assets and liabilities are also subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. Our efforts to mitigate the impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates may not be successful. As a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, and other currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways. Our net income may also fluctuate due to the impact of charges we may be required to take with respect to foreign currency hedge transactions. In particular, we may incur higher than expected charges from early termination of a hedge relationship.\nOur operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the results of future periods.\nOur investments in properties may not be fully realized.\nWe own or lease real estate primarily consisting of buildings that contain research laboratories, office space and manufacturing operations. We may decide to consolidate or co-locate certain aspects of our business operations or dispose of one or more of our properties, some of which may be located in markets that are experiencing high vacancy rates and decreasing property values. If we determine that the fair value of any of our owned properties is lower than their book value, we may not realize the full investment in these properties and incur significant impairment charges or additional depreciation when the expected useful lives of certain assets have been shortened due to the anticipated closing of facilities. If we decide to fully or partially vacate a property, we may incur significant cost, including facility closing costs, employee separation and retention expense, lease termination fees, rent expense in excess of sublease income and impairment of leasehold improvements and accelerated depreciation of assets. Any of these events may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, which could increase financing costs.\nWe may seek access to the capital and credit markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations for working capital, capital expenditure, debt refinancing, debt service requirements and other business initiatives. The capital and credit markets are experiencing, and have in the past experienced, extreme volatility and disruption, which leads to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. In the event of adverse market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital or credit market financing on favorable terms which could significantly increase our financing costs. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect us and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business. \nOur indebtedness, together with our significant contingent liabilities, including milestone and royalty payment obligations, could have important consequences to our business; for example, such obligations could: \n•\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•\nlimit our ability to access capital markets and incur additional debt in the future;\n•\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development, research and development and mergers and acquisitions; and\n•\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce its value.\nWe maintain a portfolio of marketable securities for investment of our cash as well as investments in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies. Changes in the value of our investment portfolio has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our earnings. The value of our investments may decline due to, among other things, increases in interest rates, downgrades of the bonds and other securities in our portfolio, negative company-specific news, biotechnology market sentiment, instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities in our portfolio, declines in the value of collateral underlying the securities in our portfolio and other factors. Each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks through diversification of our investments and continuous monitoring of our portfolio's overall risk profile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline.\n100\nTable of Contents\nThere can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares or that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices, which may negatively affect our stock price.\nFrom time to time our Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase programs. The amount and timing of share repurchases are subject to capital availability and our determination that share repurchases are in the best interest of our shareholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our applicable agreements. Our ability to repurchase shares will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, our results of operations, our financial condition and other factors beyond our control that we may deem relevant. Additionally, the IRA includes an excise tax on share repurchases, which will increase the cost of share repurchases. A reduction in repurchases under, or the completion of, our share repurchase programs could have a negative effect on our stock price. We can provide no assurance that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices, if at all.\nSome of our collaboration agreements contain change in control provisions that may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire us.\nSome of our collaboration agreements include change in control provisions that could reduce the potential acquisition price an acquirer is willing to pay or discourage a takeover attempt that could be viewed as beneficial to shareholders. Upon a change in control, some of these provisions could result in reduced milestone, profit or royalty payments to us or give our collaboration partner rights to terminate our collaboration agreement, acquire operational control or force the purchase or sale of the programs that are the subject of the collaboration agreement.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur effective tax rate fluctuates, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts in our financial statements.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates, including withholding taxes, in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of such places. Our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past or our current expectations due to many factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from country to country, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, interpretations by tax authorities or other bodies with jurisdiction, the result of tax cases, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws, especially in the U.S. (including the OBBBA) and Switzerland, and regulations either prospectively or retrospectively and the effects of the integrations of Reata and HI-Bio. Our estimates concerning the impact of the OBBBA remain subject to developing interpretations of the provisions of the OBBBA, which may require further adjustments and changes in our estimates, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur inability to secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities and future changes in the tax laws, among other things, may result in tax obligations in excess of amounts accrued in our financial statements.\nThe enactment of some or all of the recommendations set forth or that may be forthcoming in the OECD’s project on “Base Erosion and Profit Shifting” by tax authorities and economic blocs in the countries in which we operate, could unfavorably impact our effective tax rate. Many countries have or are in the process of enacting legislation intended to implement the OECD GloBE Model Rules. The impact on the Company will depend on the timing of implementation, the exact nature of each country's GloBE legislation, guidance and regulations (including the implications of the G7 statement on the Model Rules) thereon and their application by tax authorities either prospectively or retrospectively.\nOur business involves environmental and operational risks, which include the cost of compliance and the risk of contamination or injury.\nOur business and the business of several of our strategic partners involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biologics and radioactive compounds which make us subject to changing and evolving rules and interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our business practices. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with state, federal and foreign standards, there will always be the risk of accidental contamination or injury. If we were to become liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an extended facility shutdown, we could incur significant costs, damages and penalties that could harm our business. Manufacturing of our products and product candidates also requires permits from government agencies for water supply and wastewater discharge. If we do not obtain appropriate permits, including permits for sufficient quantities of water and wastewater, we could incur significant costs and limits on our manufacturing volumes that could harm our business. Additionally, regulators have passed new environmental disclosure rules. For example, the E.U., California and certain other \n101\nTable of Contents\ncountries we do business in have promulgated new climate disclosure rules that will generally require additional disclosure. These new rules collectively will impose additional disclosure requirements relating to climate-related risks and emissions disclosures. We expect to be subject to these new laws and regulations if or when they go into effect, which would impose extensive reporting obligations about greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risks. These recently enacted and proposed regulations may require us to incur compliance and disclosure costs and will likely require substantial management attention.\n102\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2.    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nThe following table summarizes our common stock repurchase activity under our 2020 Share Repurchase Program during the third quarter of 2025:\nPeriod\nTotal Number of\nShares Purchased\n(#)\nAverage Price\nPaid per Share\n($)\nTotal Number of\nShares Purchased\nas Part of Publicly\nAnnounced Programs\n(#)\nApproximate Dollar Value\nof Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under\nOur Programs\n($ in millions)\nJuly 1, 2025 - July 31, 2025\n— \n$\n— \n— \n$\n2,050.0 \nAugust 1, 2025 - August 31, 2025\n— \n$\n— \n— \n$\n2,050.0 \nSeptember 1, 2025 - September 30, 2025\n— \n$\n— \n— \n$\n2,050.0 \nTotal\n(1)\n— \n$\n— \n(1) \nThere were no share repurchases during the third quarter of 2025.\nIn October 2020 our Board of Directors authorized our 2020 Share Repurchase Program, which is a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock.

We have a broad portfolio of medicines to treat MS, have introduced the first approved treatment for SMA, co-developed treatments to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer’s disease and launched the first approved treatment to target a genetic cause of ALS. We market the first and only drug approved in the U.S., the E.U. and certain international markets for the treatment of FA in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older. We are focused on advancing our pipeline in neurology, specialized immunology and rare diseases. We support our drug discovery and development efforts through internal research and development programs, external collaborations and acquisitions.\nOur marketed products include TECFIDERA, VUMERITY, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY and TYSABRI for the treatment of MS; SPINRAZA for the treatment of SMA; SKYCLARYS for the treatment of FA; and QALSODY for the treatment of ALS.\nWe also have collaborations with Eisai on the commercialization of LEQEMBI for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Supernus on the commercialization of ZURZUVAE for the treatment of PPD. We have certain business and financial rights with respect to RITUXAN for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, CLL and other conditions; RITUXAN HYCELA for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL; GAZYVA for the treatment of CLL, follicular lymphoma and, following its approval in October 2025, lupus nephritis; OCREVUS for the treatment of PPMS and RMS; LUNSUMIO for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma; COLUMVI, a bispecific antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and have the option to add other potential anti-CD20 therapies, pursuant to our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group.\nWe commercialize a portfolio of biosimilars of advanced biologics including: BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL; IMRALDI, an adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA; FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE; and BYOOVIZ, a ranibizumab biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS, in certain international markets. We also have commercialization rights related to OPUVIZ, an aflibercept biosimilar referencing EYLEA, in certain international markets.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships,\n to these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (condensed consolidated financial statements).\nBasis of Presentation\nIn the opinion of management, our condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair statement of our financial statements for interim periods in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in our 2024 Form 10-K. Our accounting policies are described in the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n in our 2024 Form 10-K and updated, as necessary, in this report. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data presented for comparative purposes was derived from our audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. The results of operations for the three and nine\n \nmonths ended September 30, 2025, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year or for any other subsequent interim period. \nWe operate as \none\n operating segment, focused on discovering, developing and delivering innovative therapies for people living with serious and complex diseases.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025 we began presenting acquired in-process research and development, upfront and milestone expense as a separate line item in our condensed consolidated statements of income. Acquired in-process research and development, upfront and milestone expense includes costs incurred in connection with collaboration and license agreements such as upfront and milestone payments and, when applicable, premiums on equity securities and asset acquisitions of acquired in-process research and development, which were previously \n14\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited, continued)\nincluded in research and development expense. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassification had no impact on our total cost and expense, net income attributable to Biogen Inc., earnings per share or total equity.\nConsolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements reflect our financial statements, those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. For consolidated entities where we own or are exposed to less than \n100.0\n% of the economics, we record net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax in our condensed consolidated statements of income equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective noncontrolling parties. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. \nIn determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, we apply a qualitative approach that determines whether we have both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to that entity. We continuously assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as changes to existing relationships or future transactions may result in us consolidating or deconsolidating one or more of our collaborators or partners.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n15\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited, continued)\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in \nNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2024 Form 10-K.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that we adopt as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed below, we do not believe that the adoption of recently issued standards have had, or may have, a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nStandard\nDescription\nEffective Date\nEffects on the financial statements\nASU No. 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nThis standard establishes incremental disaggregation of income tax disclosures pertaining to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendments in this update are required to be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply it retrospectively.\nAnnual reporting for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted.\nWe are currently evaluating the potential impact that this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and expect to apply this standard prospectively upon adoption.\nASU No. 2024-03, \nIncome Statement (Subtopic 220-40): Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures\nThis standard requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements, at each interim and annual reporting period, of specified information about certain costs and expense including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included in each relevant expense caption. This standard also requires a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated, as well as disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses, and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses.\nAnnual reporting for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted.\nWe are currently evaluating the potential impact that this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nASU No. 2025-07, \nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Derivatives Scope Refinements and Scope Clarification for Share-Based Noncash Consideration from a Customer in a Revenue Contract\nThis standard refines and expands the existing scope exceptions that exclude certain contracts, including certain R&D funding arrangements, from derivative accounting, and clarifies the accounting for share-based noncash consideration received from a customer.\nAnnual reporting for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted.\nWe have early adopted this new standard on a modified retrospective basis as of January 1, 2025. Adoption did not have a material impac\nt on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n16\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited, continued)\nNote 2:\nAcquisitions\nAlcyone Therapeutics, Inc.\nIn September 2025 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Alcyone Therapeutics, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on pediatric care through precision CNS therapeutics and dosing platforms. Alcyone's lead asset is ThecaFlex DRx, an implantable subcutaneous port and catheter device being investigated for the intrathecal delivery of ASOs, which is designed to provide an alternative to repeat lumbar punctures in chronic intrathecal administration of medicines.\nWe have agreed to pay an upfront cash payment of $\n85.0\n million upon closing, plus additional potential amounts payable upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the development and regulatory approval of ThecaFlex DRx for administering SPINRAZA and additional pipeline products.\nWe plan to account for this proposed acquisition as an asset acquisition as the value being acquired primarily relates to a single asset and plan to record the upfront payment within acquired in-process research and development, upfront and milestone expense within our condensed consolidated statements of income upon the completion of this proposed acquisition. We anticipate the\n proposed acquisition to close during the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. U\nnder the terms of this proposed acquisition, we expect to oversee the end-to-end development, manufacturing and commercialization of ThecaFlex DRx\n.\nAlcyone's remaining therapeutic assets would be divested from Alcyone into Neela Therapeutics, Inc., a newly formed independent company, prior to the closing of this proposed acquisition. We anticipate to make a convertible debt investment of up to\n $\n5.0\n million in Neela Therapeutics. Inc.\nHuman Immunology Biosciences\nOn July 2, 2024, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of HI-Bio, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on targeted therapies for patients with severe immune-mediated diseases. HI-Bio's lead asset, felzartamab, an anti-CD38 antibody, is currently being evaluated for several indications, including three leading indications, AMR, PMN and IgAN. Felzartamab has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation and ODD from the FDA for development in the treatment of PMN and AMR. Subsequent to our acquisition, felzartamab received ODD in the E.U. in IgAN and solid organ transplantation. The acquisition of HI-Bio is expected to augment our pipeline and build on our expertise in immunology.\nUnder the terms of this acquisition, we paid shareholders of HI-Bio approximately $\n1.15\n billion at closing and may pay up to a total of \n$\n650.0\n million in contingent development and regulatory milestone payments.\n The $\n1.15\n billion paid includes approximately $\n74.5\n million related to HI-Bio's outstanding, non-vested equity awards, inclusive of employer taxes, of which $\n56.4\n million was recognized as share-based compensation payments to settle non-vested equity awards attributable to the post-acquisition service period and therefore not reflected as a component of total purchase price paid. Of the total $\n56.4\n million, we recognized approximately $\n42.5\n million as a charge to research and development expense with the remaining $\n13.9\n million as a charge to selling, general and \nadministrative expense within our condensed consolidated statements of income for the \nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2025\n. \nThese amounts were associated with the accelerated vesting of stock options and RSUs previously granted to HI-Bio employees and required no future services to vest.\nUpon closing we also paid an additional \n$\n43.7\n million related to working capital adjustments as of the transaction close date, which was included as a component of total purchase price paid.\nWe funded this acquisition through available cash on hand and accounted for this acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with\n \nASC Topic 805, Business Combinations\n, and recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date.\n17\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited, continued)\nPurchase Price Consideration\nTotal consideration transferred for the acquisition of HI-Bio is summarized as follows:\n(In millions)\nAs of July 2, 2024\nCash consideration paid to HI-Bio shareholders\n(1)\n$\n1,137.3\n \nContingent consideration\n485.1\n \nTotal consideration\n$\n1,622.4\n \n(1)\n Represents total consideration paid to shareholders of HI-Bio of $\n1.15\n billion, plus an additional $\n43.7\n million related to working capital adjustments as of the transaction close date, less $\n56.4\n million of cash paid for HI-Bio's outstanding, non-vested equity awards, inclusive of employer taxes, which were recognized as compensation attributable to the post-acquisition service period and therefore not reflected as a component of total consideration.\n \nContingent Consideration:\n We may make certain contingent payments to the former shareholders of HI-Bio upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. As of the acquisition date, the maximum aggregate amount payable for these potential milestones was $\n650.0\n million. The acquisition-date fair value of these milestones was approximately $\n485.1\n million and was estimated utilizing a probability-adjusted discounted cash flow calculation using an appropriate discount rate dependent on the nature and timing of the milestone payments, which ranged from \n6.2\n% to \n7.0\n%, and \nprobabilities of technological and regulatory success ranging from \n67.0\n% to near-certain probability.\nOf the total contingent consideration, approximately $\n279.3\n million related to milestones classified as short-term and reflected as a component of accrued expense and other with the remaining $\n205.8\n million reflected as a component of other long-term liabilities within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The short-term liability related to the fourth patient dosed in a Phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab in a first and s\necond indication, which would each result in the achievement of a $\n150.0\n million milestone payment. During the second quarter of 2025 the first milestone related to the fourth patient dosed in a phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab for AMR was achieved, resulting in a $\n150.0\n million milestone payment made to the former shareholders of HI-Bio, which was paid during the third quarter of 2025. In October 2025 the second milestone related to the fourth patient dosed in a phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab for IgAN was achieved, resulting in a $\n150.0\n million milestone payment to be made to the former shareholders of HI-Bio, which we expect will be paid during the fourth quarter of 2025.\nSubsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation are being recognized as (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration within our condensed consolidated statements of income. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 fair value measurements. For additional information related to the fair value of this obligation, please read \nNote 8, Fair Value Measurements\n, to these condensed consolidated financial statements.\nOther Contractual Commitments: \nWe acquired HI-Bio's pre-existing in-license commitments under third-party agreements with MorphoSys, which included tiered royalties on potential future sales ranging from high-single digit to mid-teen percentages, as well as potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $\n130.0\n million, $\n230.0\n million and $\n640.0\n million, respectively. At the transaction close date the achievement of these milestones was not considered probable and therefore not recorded in our financial statements.\n18\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited, continued)\nPurchase Price Allocation\nWe finalized purchase accounting for this acquisition in the second quarter of 2025.\nThe following table summarizes the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, and reflects measurement period adjustments made to the amounts initially recorded as of the acquisition date on July 2, 2024. The related impact to our condensed consolidated statements of income that would have been recognized in previous periods if the adjustments were recognized as of the acquisition date is immaterial.\n(In millions)\nAmounts Recognized as of Acquisition Date\n(as adjusted)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n62.5\n \nIntangible assets:\nIPR&D - felzartamab (IgAN)\n920.0\n \nIPR&D - felzartamab (AMR)\n450.0\n \nIPR&D - felzartamab (PMN)\n265.0\n \nOther clinical programs\n7.9\n \nPrepaid expense and other assets\n(1)\n1.4\n \nOperating lease assets\n1.2\n \nAccounts payable\n(\n1.1\n)\nAccrued liabilities\n(\n35.0\n)\nDeferred tax liability\n(1)\n(\n309.3\n)\nOperating lease liabilities\n(\n1.2\n)\nTotal identifiable net assets\n1,361.4\n \nGoodwill\n(1)\n261.0\n \nTotal assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n$\n1,622.4\n \n(1)\n Includes measurement period adjustments recorded in 2025 that increased prepaid expense and other assets by $\n0.4\n million, net deferred tax liability by $\n4.9\n million and goodwill by $\n4.5\n million.\nIntang\nible assets:\n Intangible assets comprised of approximately $\n1.6\n billion of IPR&D related to HI-Bio's lead asset felzartamab. This includes $\n920.0\n million of IPR&D related to felzartamab indication for IgAN, $\n450.0\n million of IPR&D related to felzartamab indication for AMR and $\n265.0\n million of IPR&D related to felzartamab indication for PMN. The estimated fair values of the program related intangible assets were determined using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, utilizing cash flow analyses and a discount rate of \n14.5\n%. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 fair value measurements.\nGoodwill:\n Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acq\nuired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. We recognized goodwill of approximately $\n261.0\n million, which includes measurement period adjustments, and is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill recognized from our acquisition of HI-Bio is primarily the result of the deferred tax consequences from the transaction recorded for financial statement purposes.\nAcquisition-related expense:\n Acquisition-related expense, primarily comprised\n of advisory and legal fees, and other transaction costs, totaled approximately $\n2.8\n million and were recorded within selling, general and administrative expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024, included in our \n2024\n Form 10-K\n.\n19\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC.

In consideration for the PRV we received a cash payment of $\n103.0\n million upon the closing of the PRV purchase, of which approximately $\n14.4\n million was paid to Ionis. Our net portion of approximately $\n88.6\n million was recognized in gain on sale of priority review voucher, net within our condensed consolidated statements of income for the \nnine\n months ended September 30, 2024.\nSale of TOFIDENCE\nIn March 2025 we completed the sale of our regulatory and commercial rights in the U.S. for TOFIDENCE, a tocilizumab biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA, to Organon.

The Fit for Growth program is expected to generate approximately $\n1.0\n billion in gross operating expense savings by the end of 2025, some of which will be reinvested in various initiatives. The Fit for Growth program is currently estimated to include net headcount reductions of approximately \n1,400\n employees and we expect to incur total restructuring charges of approximately $\n310.0\n million, which were substantially achieved as of September 30, 2025.\n20\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impact of a $\n3.5\n million impairment charge related to a compound acquired from HI-Bio. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects impairment charges of approximately $\n20.2\n million related to intangible assets associated with the termination of Samsung Bioepis' commercialization rights during the third quarter of 2024.\nCompleted Technology\nCompleted technology primarily relates to our other marketed products and programs acquired through asset acquisitions, licenses and business combinations. Completed technology intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between \n2\n to \n31\n years, with a remaining weighted average useful life of \n12\n years.\nIPR&D Related to Business Combinations\nIPR&D represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that we acquired as part of a business combination and had not yet reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition. Included in IPR&D balances are adjustments related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe carrying value associated with our IPR&D assets as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, primarily relates to the IPR&D programs we acquired in connection with our acquisition of HI-Bio in July 2024, with an estimated fair value of approximately $\n1.6\n billion.\nPriority Review Voucher\nIn connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we acquired a rare pediatric disease PRV which may be used to obtain priority review by the FDA for a future regulatory submission or sold to a third party.

The value of revenue and operating expense measured in U.S. dollars is therefore subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options with financial institutions with the primary objective to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our international revenue and operating expense.\nForeign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options in effect as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, had durations of \n1\n to \n24\n months and \n1\n to \n12\n months, respectively. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on the portion of these foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options that are included in the effectiveness test are reported in AOCI. Realized gains and losses of such contracts and options are recognized in revenue when the sale of product in the currency being hedged is recognized and in operating expense when the expense in the currency being hedged is recorded. We recognize all cash flow hedge reclassifications from AOCI and fair value changes of excluded portions in the same line item in our condensed consolidated statements of income that have been impacted by the hedged item.\nThe notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options that were entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and operating expense is summarized as follows:\nNotional Amount\n(In millions)\nAs of September 30, 2025\nAs of December 31, 2024\nEuro\n$\n1,524.8\n \n$\n1,062.6\n \nBritish pound\n35.0\n \n133.8\n \nSwiss franc\n68.0\n \n—\n \nCanadian dollar\n9.9\n \n38.6\n \nTotal foreign currency forward contracts and options\n$\n1,637.7\n \n$\n1,235.0\n \nThe pre-tax portion of the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options that were included in AOCI in total equity is summarized as follows:\n(In millions)\nAs of September 30, 2025\nAs of December 31, 2024\nUnrealized gains\n$\n9.5\n \n$\n50.6\n \nUnrealized (losses)\n(\n112.9\n)\n(\n0.3\n)\nNet unrealized gains (losses)\n$\n(\n103.4\n)\n$\n50.3\n \nWe expect net unrealized losses of approximately $\n103.4\n million to be settled over the next 24 months, of which approximately $\n90.8\n million of these net unrealized losses are expected to be settled over the next 12 months, with any amounts in AOCI to be reported as an adjustment to revenue or operating expense. We consider the impact of our and our counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute its contractual obligations.

As part of a multi-year real estate consolidation plan that is expected to result in a reduction of approximately \n40\n% of our real estate footprint in Massachusetts, this new lease is intended to replace two existing leases, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts, including our current corporate headquarters. We expect the initial lease term of approximately \n15.5\n years to commence on May 31, 2028. The estimated minimum lease payments as a result of the new lease total approximately $\n1.5\n billion over the initial lease term. We have an option to extend the lease for three extension periods of five years each and one six month short-term extension, at then market-based rates. We will account for this lease as a right-of-use asset and lease liability upon the lease commencement date.\nFor additional information on our accounting policies relating to leases, please read \nNote 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Leases\n, to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2024 Form 10-K.\nNote 13:\nIndebtedness\n2025 Senior Notes\nOn May 12, 2025, we issued senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $\n1.75\n billion, consisting of the following:\n•\n$\n400.0\n million of \n5.050\n% Senior Notes due January 15, 2031, valued at \n99.981\n% of par;\n•\n$\n650.0\n million of \n5.750\n% Senior Notes due May 15, 2035, valued at \n99.924\n% of par; and\n•\n$\n700.0\n million of \n6.450\n% Senior Notes due May 15, 2055, valued at \n99.657\n% of par.\nOur 2025 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations and may be redeemed at our option at any time at \n100\n% of the principal amount plus accrued interest and, until a specified period before maturity, a specified make-whole amount.

Con. Res. 14\", commonly referred to as the OBBBA.\nThe OBBBA contains tax provisions, such as the permanent extension or revision of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, modifications to the international tax framework and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The provisions of the OBBBA have multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through 2027. The OBBBA did not result in any material adjustments to our total income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, and we have adjusted our deferred tax balances to reflect the impacts of the OBBBA enactment.\nTax Rate\nA reconciliation between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and our effective tax rate is summarized as follows:\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nStatutory rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nState taxes\n1.7\n \n2.5\n \n1.7\n \n1.7\n \nTaxes on foreign earnings, including valuation allowances\n(\n5.0\n)\n(\n11.9\n)\n(\n7.2\n)\n(\n7.0\n)\nTax credits\n(\n1.6\n)\n(\n1.2\n)\n(\n1.8\n)\n(\n1.7\n)\nPurchased inventory valuation step-up and intangible assets\n2.4\n \n3.3\n \n2.3\n \n2.0\n \nGILTI\n(\n1.2\n)\n(\n1.1\n)\n(\n1.0\n)\n(\n1.4\n)\nShare-based compensation awards\n—\n \n—\n \n1.1\n \n0.2\n \nOBBBA enactment\n(\n2.1\n)\n—\n \n(\n0.7\n)\n—\n \nOther, including permanent items\n1.1\n \n1.3\n \n1.4\n \n0.6\n \nEffective tax rate\n16.3\n \n%\n13.9\n \n%\n16.8\n \n%\n15.4\n \n%\n40\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited, continued)\nChanges in Tax Rate\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, the increases in our effective tax rates were partially driven by changes in the territorial mix of our profitability, partially offset by the impact of the OBBBA enactment.\nThe nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, also reflects the impacts of certain share-based compensation awards that vested during the first quarter of 2025 and a decrease in our estimate of Pillar Two minimum tax liabilities.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rates benefited from a decrease in our valuation allowance, partially offset by the impact of certain foreign uncertain tax positions. \nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\nWe and our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. We file income tax returns in various U.S. states and in U.S. federal and other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examination for years before 2021 or state, local or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2013.\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other national tax authorities routinely examine our intercompany transfer pricing with respect to intellectual property related transactions and it is possible that they may disagree with one or more positions we have taken with respect to such valuations.\nIt is reasonably possible that we will adjust the value of our uncertain tax positions related to certain transfer pricing, collaboration matters, withholding taxes and other issues as we receive additional information from various taxing authorities, including reaching settlements with such authorities.\nWe estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, could\ndecrease by up to approximately $\n35.0\n million in the next 12 months as a result of various audit closures, settlements and expiration of the statute of limitations.\nNote 18:\nOther Consolidated Financial Statement Detail\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nComponents of other (income) expense, net, are summarized as follows:\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nInterest income\n$\n(\n31.6\n)\n$\n(\n11.6\n)\n$\n(\n87.8\n)\n$\n(\n49.1\n)\nInterest expense\n67.4\n \n59.8\n \n200.0\n \n190.3\n \n(Gains) losses on investments, net\n3.8\n \n(\n39.1\n)\n34.1\n \n22.2\n \nForeign exchange (gains) losses, net\n10.3\n \n4.9\n \n16.9\n \n25.6\n \nOther, net\n(\n15.8\n)\n0.8\n \n(\n12.0\n)\n4.7\n \nTotal other (income) expense, net\n$\n34.1\n \n$\n14.8\n \n$\n151.2\n \n$\n193.7\n \nThe (gains) losses on investments, net, as reflected in the table above, relate to equity securities of certain biotechnology companies, venture capital funds where the underlying investments are in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies and non-marketable equity securities.\nThe following table summarizes our (gains) losses on investments, net that relate to our equity securities held during the following periods:\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet (gains) losses recognized on equity securities\n$\n3.8\n \n$\n(\n39.1\n)\n$\n34.1\n \n$\n21.9\n \nLess: Net (gains) losses realized on equity securities\n7.0\n \n(\n10.9\n)\n1.6\n \n(\n5.4\n)\nNet unrealized (gains) losses recognized on equity securities\n$\n(\n3.2\n)\n$\n(\n28.2\n)\n$\n32.5\n \n$\n27.3\n \n41\nTable of Contents\nBIOGEN INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited, continued)\nOCREVUS\nPursuant to the terms of our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, we receive a tiered royalty on U.S. net sales from \n13.5\n% and increasing up to \n24.0\n% if annual net sales exceed $\n900.0\n million. There will be a \n50.0\n% reduction to these royalties upon the first entry of an FDA approved biosimilar to OCREVUS.\nIn addition, we receive a gross \n3.0\n% royalty on net sales of OCREVUS outside the U.S., with the royalty period lasting \n11\n years from the first commercial sale of OCREVUS on a country-by-country basis.\nThe commercialization of OCREVUS does not impact the percentage of the co-promotion profits we receive for RITUXAN, LUNSUMIO or GAZYVA. Genentech is solely responsible for development and commercialization of OCREVUS and funding future costs. Genentech cannot develop OCREVUS in CLL, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or rheumatoid arthritis.\nOCREVUS royalty revenue is based on our estimates from third party and market research data of OCREVUS sales occurring during the corresponding period.

We have a broad portfolio of medicines to treat MS, have introduced the first approved treatment for SMA, co-developed treatments to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer’s disease and launched the first approved treatment to target a genetic cause of ALS. We market the first and only drug approved in the U.S., the E.U. and certain international markets for the treatment of FA in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older. We are focused on advancing our pipeline in neurology, specialized immunology and rare diseases. We support our drug discovery and development efforts through internal research and development programs, external collaborations and acquisitions.\nOur marketed products include TECFIDERA, VUMERITY, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY and TYSABRI for the treatment of MS; SPINRAZA for the treatment of SMA; SKYCLARYS for the treatment of FA; and QALSODY for the treatment of ALS.\nWe also have collaborations with Eisai on the commercialization of LEQEMBI for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Supernus on the commercialization of ZURZUVAE for the treatment of PPD. We have certain business and financial rights with respect to RITUXAN for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, CLL and other conditions; RITUXAN HYCELA for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL; GAZYVA for the treatment of CLL, follicular lymphoma and, following its approval in October 2025, lupus nephritis; OCREVUS for the treatment of PPMS and RMS; LUNSUMIO for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma; COLUMVI, a bispecific antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and have the option to add other potential anti-CD20 therapies, pursuant to our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group.\nWe commercialize a portfolio of biosimilars of advanced biologics including: BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL; IMRALDI, an adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA; FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE; and BYOOVIZ, a ranibizumab biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS, in certain international markets. We also have commercialization rights related to OPUVIZ, an aflibercept biosimilar referencing EYLEA, in certain international markets.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships,\n to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe seek to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines to patients around the world. To that end, we regularly review our manufacturing capacity, capabilities, processes and facilities. In order to support our future growth and drug development pipeline, we expanded our large molecule production capacity and built a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland. Solothurn is operational and has been approved for the manufacture of LEQEMBI. We believe that the Solothurn facility will support our anticipated near to mid-term needs for the manufacturing of biologic assets. The plant represents a significant increase in our overall manufacturing capacity. Additionally, we continue to invest to modernize, automate and support the capacity requirements for our pipeline and existing products at our existing manufacturing facilities in RTP, North Carolina. If we are unable to fully utilize our manufacturing facilities, we will incur additional excess capacity charges which would have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the longer term, our revenue growth will depend upon the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products as well as additional indications for our existing products, our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other rights related to our marketed products, assets originating from our research and development efforts and/or successful execution of external business development opportunities.\n54\nTable of Contents\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nThe biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. Many of our competitors are working to develop or have commercialized products similar to those we market. In addition, the commercialization of certain of our own approved products, products of our collaborators and pipeline product candidates may negatively impact future sales of our existing products.\nOur products and revenue streams continue to face increasing competition in many markets from the introduction of new originator therapies, generics, biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Some of these products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products. Accordingly, the introduction of such products as well as other lower-priced competing products has, and in the future, may significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell, which can negatively impact our revenue. In addition, in some markets, when a generic or biosimilar version of one of our products is commercialized, it may be automatically substituted for our product and significantly reduce our revenue in a short period of time.\nSales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on the availability and extent of adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. When a new pharmaceutical product is approved, the availability of government and private reimbursement for that product may be uncertain, as is the pricing and amount for which that product will be reimbursed.\nDrug prices are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are prescribed; for example the IRA has certain provisions related to drug pricing, including the ability for the U.S. government to set prices for certain drugs in Medicare. We expect drug pricing and other healthcare costs will continue to be subject to political and societal pressures on a global basis. As the policy environment remains dynamic, we will continue to monitor how uncertainty with respect to how the U.S. and foreign tariffs and the U.S. and international pricing may impact our business in the future.\nAdditionally, our ability to set the price for our products varies significantly from country to country and, as a result, so can the price or reimbursement of our products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price).\nOur failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenue and results of operations, could curtail or eliminate our ability to adequately fund research and development programs for the discovery and commercialization of new products and/or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price.\nIn addition to the impact of competition, pricing actions and other measures being taken worldwide designed to reduce healthcare costs and limit the overall level of government expenditures, our sales and operations could also be affected by other risks of doing business internationally, including the impact of public health epidemics on employees, the global economy and the delivery of healthcare treatments, geopolitical events, tariffs, supply chain disruptions, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, changes in intellectual property legal protections and changes in trade regulations and procedures.\nFor a detailed discussion on our business environment, please read \nItem 1. Business\n, in our 2024 Form 10-K. For additional information on our competition and pricing risks that could negatively impact our product sales, please read \nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n included in this report.\nTECFIDERA\nMultiple TECFIDERA generic entrants are now in North America, Brazil and certain European countries and have deeply discounted prices compared to TECFIDERA. The generic competition for TECFIDERA has significantly reduced our TECFIDERA revenue and we expect that TECFIDERA revenue will continue to decline. We are defending the validity of our EP 2 653 873 patent related to TECFIDERA which expires in 2028 in opposition proceedings before the Technical Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office in November 2025. We are also engaged in litigation in Europe to defend and enforce national counterparts of our EP 2 653 873 patent, with mixed results as we have been unsuccessful in enjoining generic entry in several significant European markets.\nFor additional information, please read \nNote 21, Litigation\n, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n55\nTable of Contents\nTYSABRI\nA biosimilar entrant of TYSABRI was approved in the U.S. and the E.U. in 2023. We expect that future sales of TYSABRI will continue to be adversely affected by the entrance of this biosimilar in certain international markets.\nGOODWILL\nWe review our goodwill for impairment annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As part of this analysis, we compare the fair value of our one reporting unit to its carrying value through the assessment of qualitative, and, if necessary, quantitative factors. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit, we will record an impairment loss equal to the difference. As of our most recent annual impairment analysis, we had no accumulated impairment losses related to goodwill.\nAn interim goodwill impairment test based on quantitative factors may be required if adverse events indicate an impairment might be present. We monitor changes to our share price between annual impairment tests, and we believe that general deterioration in macroeconomic and industry-specific conditions may not be indicators of a goodwill impairment, as such conditions may not represent a significant adverse change to our underlying operating performance, cash flows, financial condition or liquidity. Should our market capitalization decline below the carrying value of our net assets for a sustained period, we would consider the length and severity of the decline and the reason for the decline when assessing whether potential goodwill impairment exists.\nFor additional information on goodwill, please read \nNote 7, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nBUSINESS UPDATE REGARDING MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER POTENTIAL DISRUPTIONS\nSignificant portions of our business are conducted in Europe, Asia and other international geographies. Factors such as global health outbreaks, adverse weather events, geopolitical events, tariffs, inflation, labor or raw material shortages and other supply chain disruptions could result in product shortages or other difficulties and delays or increased costs in manufacturing our products. \nEconomic conditions remain uncertain as markets continue to be impacted in part by elevated inflation, higher interest rates, extreme weather events, global supply chain uncertainties and risks associated with geopolitical conflicts. Global supply chain disruptions, such as strikes, work stoppages, port congestion, port closures, trade restrictions, capacity constraints and other logistical problems, may affect our ability to do business.\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE\nGlobal disputes and interruptions in international relationships, including tariffs, trade protection measures, embargoes, import or export licensing requirements and the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions, may affect our ability to do business and the costs that we incur in providing products to our patients.\nThe U.S. has imposed a baseline tariff on imports from all countries, subject to certain exceptions. Trade-related tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs and sanctions being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China and retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on U.S. imports.\nThe U.S. Secretary of Commerce has further initiated an investigation to determine the effects on the national security of imports of pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, including finished drug products, medical countermeasures, critical inputs such as active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials and derivative products of those items, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\nThere is a high degree of uncertainty concerning what future steps countries and economic blocs will take in response to changes in global trade rules and economics.\nWe have significant manufacturing presence in the U.S. While our portfolio is evolving, approximately three quarters of our 2024 U.S. product revenue was attributable to products which were largely manufactured in the U.S. However, we, and the pharmaceutical industry, do utilize partners and production facilities located outside the U.S. for certain raw materials, ingredients, processes and components for our pharmaceutical products and their delivery devices. Engaging alternative suppliers may involve seeking additional regulatory approvals and incurring additional costs and risks associated with new suppliers. This may be costly in terms of time and resources needed or result in delays.\nKey products that are currently manufactured mainly outside the U.S. are TECFIDERA, VUMERITY and LEQEMBI. In 2024 we initiated a technology transfer process to enable us to manufacture LEQEMBI in the U.S.\n56\nTable of Contents\nAlthough certain starting materials for SKYCLARYS rely on a single supplier based in China, the manufacturing process, including active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug substance, is primarily conducted in the U.S.\nWe are working to mitigate potential exposure from tariffs across our network. \nWe currently do not expect a material impact in 2025 from potential tariffs as previously announced by the U.S. Administration during 2025, even if the exemption for pharmaceuticals were to be removed. This is based on the expected timing of any potential tariffs, our manufacturing footprint, and our inventory levels and positioning, although the actual impact of tariffs on our business and financial condition may differ materially from our current expectations. We will continue to monitor the current and future global tariff landscape as it evolves.\nGEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS\nThe ongoing geopolitical tensions related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the military conflict in the Middle East have resulted in global business disruptions and economic volatility. For example, sanctions and other restrictions have been levied on the government and businesses in Russia. Although we do not have affiliates or employees in either Russia or Ukraine, we do provide various therapies to patients in Russia through a distributor. Government sanctions on the export of certain manufacturing materials to Russia may delay or limit our ability to get new products approved. The impact of the conflict on our operations and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, its impact on regional and global economic conditions and whether the conflict spreads or has effects on countries outside Ukraine and Russia.\nWe will continue to monitor the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as the military conflict in the Middle East and assess any potential impacts on our business, supply chain, partners or customers, as well as any factors that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Revenue generated from sales in Russia and Ukraine represent less than 1.0% of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Additionally, revenue generated from sales in the Middle East region represents less than 2.0% of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nINFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 2022\nIn August 2022 the IRA was signed into law in the U.S. The IRA introduced new tax provisions, including a 15.0% corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1.0% excise tax on stock repurchases. The provisions of the IRA are effective for periods after December 31, 2022. The IRA did not result in any material adjustments to our income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Preliminary guidance has been issued by the IRS and we expect additional guidance and regulations to be issued in future periods. We continue to assess its potential impact on our business and results of operations as further information becomes available.\nThe IRA also contains substantial drug pricing reforms that may have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. This includes the following:\n(i)    allowing CMS to negotiate prices for select high-cost Medicare Part D drugs (beginning in 2026) and Part B drugs (beginning in 2028) to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, potentially resulting in higher contributions from plans and manufacturers;\n(ii)    drug inflationary rebate requirements to penalize manufacturers from raising the prices of Medicare covered single-source drugs and biologics beyond the inflation-adjusted rate, beginning in 2022 for Part D drugs and 2023 for Part B drugs;\n(iii)    to incentivize biosimilar development, the IRA provides an 8.0% Medicare Part B add-on payment for qualifying biosimilar products for a five-year period; and\n(iv)    Medicare Part D redesign which replaces the current coverage gap provisions and establishes a $2,000 cap for out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries beginning in 2025, with manufacturers being responsible for up to 10.0% of costs up to the $2,000 cap and up to 20.0% after that cap is reached. Manufacturers that qualify as either specified or specified small manufacturers will phase-in the new manufacturer liability for prescription drug costs over a 7-year period from 2025 to 2031 for certain Medicare Part D drugs dispensed to certain beneficiaries. In April 2024 CMS informed us that we qualified for the specified manufacturer exception pertaining to the Medicare Part D redesign.\nWe expect the IRA's drug pricing controls and Medicare Part D redesign may have an adverse impact on our full-year sales, particularly for our products that are more substantially reliant on Medicare reimbursement. We anticipate the IRA Medicare Part D redesign will have a modest net unfavorable impact to our 2025 revenue, ranging from approximately $50.0 million to $100.0 million, concentrated in our SKYCLARYS and MS portfolio product revenue, approximately a third of which could be associated with SKYCLARYS.\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe degree of impact from this legislation on our business depends on a number of forthcoming implementation actions by regulatory authorities, which may be further impacted by other legislative acts that may modify or replace the IRA, such as the OBBBA, as discussed below. The full extent of the IRA's impacts on our sales and, in turn, our business, remains uncertain.\n2025 LEGISLATION AND TAX REFORM\nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. signed into law the H.R.1 legislation formally titled \"An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Title II of H. Con. Res. 14\", commonly referred to as the OBBBA.\nThe OBBBA contains tax provisions, such as the permanent extension or revision of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, modifications to the international tax framework and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The provisions of the OBBBA have multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through 2027.\nThe OBBBA did not result in any material adjustments to our total income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, and we have adjusted our deferred tax balances to reflect the impacts of the OBBBA enactment. However, given the complexity of tax laws, related regulations and interpretations, our current estimates may require revision as additional information becomes available regarding the application of the OBBBA provisions.\nThe OBBBA also enacts significant potential changes to Medicaid funding and rescinds or does not continue elements of the PPACA. The OBBBA implements additional eligibility rules on government health plans, expands administrative procedures around enrollment, modifies how states can obtain federal funding for Medicaid and no longer extends ACA premium subsidies. Additional federal and state guidance is expected to be issued in order to implement these OBBBA provisions, most of which have effective dates in 2027 and 2028.\nAt this time, we are unable to determine the overall impact that the OBBBA will have on our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the impact the OBBBA will have on the pharmaceutical industry as a whole because any such impact will depend upon developing interpretations of the OBBBA provisions and implementing regulations, which may be material.\n58\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nAs described below under \nResults of Operations\n, our net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Biogen Inc. for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflects the following:\nTOTAL REVENUE\nIncreased\n$68.9 million or 2.8%\nDILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nIncreased\n$0.51 or 19.2%\nPRODUCT REVENUE, NET\nIncreased\n$77.5 million or 4.4%\n•\nMS revenue increased $7.6 million, or 0.7%\n•\nRare disease revenue increased $38.5 million, or 7.8%\n•\nThe increase in MS product revenue was primarily due to an increase in U.S. VUMERITY driven by higher demand, timing of shipments and favorable pricing dynamics, partially offset by a decrease in global TECFIDERA demand due to increased competition outside the U.S. from generic competition. MS product revenue in the U.S. also benefited from favorable commercial mix and approximately $38.0 million of favorable changes in estimates from discounts and allowances.\n•\nThe increase in rare disease product revenue was primarily due to our new product launches, including global SKYCLARYS revenue of $132.9 million and global QALSODY revenue of $26.4 million in the third quarter of 2025.\n•\nZURZUVAE revenue of $55.3 million in the third quarter of 2025 was driven by the continued launch in the U.S.\nTOTAL COST AND EXPENSE\nDecreased\n$37.4 million or 1.9%\n•\nCost of sales increased $35.7 million, or 5.6%\n•\nR&D expense decreased $80.1 million, or 15.5%\n•\nSG&A expense increased $6.4 million, or 1.1%\n•\nThe increase in cost of sales was primarily due to a charge recorded during the third quarter of 2025 of approximately $104.3 million related to a litigation matter and higher SKYCLARYS inventory step-up amortization costs, partially offset by lower cost of contract manufacturing revenue driven by the timing of batch releases and lower inventory write-offs during the third quarter of 2025.\n•\nThe decrease in R&D expense was primarily driven by continued cost reduction measures realized in connection with our portfolio prioritization initiatives and our Fit for Growth program, offset in part by higher spend on clinical trials, including litifilimab and felzartamab. Higher clinical trial spend related to litifilimab was offset by $50.0 million in R&D funding received from Royalty Pharma.\n•\nThe increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to increases in operational spending on sales and marketing activities in support of LEQEMBI and SKYCLARYS as we continue to expand our U.S. and international product launches.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n•\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $4.0 billion as of September 30, 2025, compared to approximately $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n•\nWe generated approximately $1.7 billion of net cash flow from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to approximately $2.1 billion in the prior year comparative period.\n•\nThe year-over-year reduction in net cash flow from operations was due in part to higher worldwide tax payments in 2025 of approximately $840.7 million driven by the timing of estimated payments.\n•\nIn May 2025 we issued our 2025 Senior Notes for an aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion. In June 2025 we used the net proceeds to redeem our 4.050% Senior Notes due September 15, 2025, prior to maturity.\n59\nTable of Contents\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\n2025 ACQUISITIONS, COLLABORATIVE AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS\nALCYONE THERAPEUTICS, INC.\nIn September 2025 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Alcyone Therapeutics, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on pediatric care through precision CNS therapeutics and dosing platforms.

This increase was partially offset by a decrease in rest of world Interferon revenue as patients continue to transition to higher efficacy therapies.\n•\nGlobal TECFIDERA revenue decreased $64.6 million, from $232.8 million in 2024 to $168.2 million in 2025, or 27.7%, driven by a decrease in demand resulting from multiple TECFIDERA generic entrants.\n•\nGlobal VUMERITY revenue increased $114.3 million, from $451.4 million in 2024 to $565.7 million in 2025, or 25.3%, primarily due to an increase in U.S. VUMERITY driven by higher demand and a favorable change in estimate of approximately $40.0 million related to rebates and discounts in the U.S., partially offset by charges related to the IRA redesign.\n•\nGlobal TYSABRI revenue decreased $31.7 million, from $1,299.6 million in 2024 to $1,267.9 million in 2025, or 2.4%, primarily due to increased competition in rest of world, including the impacts from a biosimilar entrant of TYSABRI in Europe. The decrease was partially offset by a favorable change in estimate of approximately $16.0 million related to rebates and discounts and favorable inventory dynamics in the U.S.\n•\nGlobal Interferon revenue decreased $12.1 million, from $732.0 million in 2024 to $719.9 million in 2025, or 1.7%, driven by a decrease in demand as patients transition to higher efficacy therapies, offset in part by a favorable change in estimate of approximately $32.0 million related to rebates and discounts in the U.S.\n•\nGlobal TECFIDERA revenue decreased $171.4 million, from $739.3 million in 2024 to $567.9 million in 2025, or 23.2%, driven by a decrease in demand as a result of multiple TECFIDERA generic entrants.\nMS revenue includes sales from TECFIDERA, VUMERITY, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, TYSABRI and FAMPYRA. Effective January 1, 2025, our collaboration and license agreement for FAMPYRA global commercialization rights was terminated and we expect to recognize minimal revenue in 2025.\nIn 2025 we expect total MS revenue will continue to decline as a result of increasing competition for many of our MS products in both the U.S. and rest of world markets. We expect TECFIDERA revenue will be adversely impacted by accelerating generic competition in certain markets in the E.U. for at least the remainder of the year. Additionally, a biosimilar entrant of TYSABRI was approved in the U.S. and the E.U. in 2023. We expect that future sales of TYSABRI will continue to be adversely affected by the entrance of this biosimilar in certain international markets.\n65\nTable of Contents\nRARE DISEASE\n•\nU.S. SPINRAZA revenue increased $0.1 million, from $153.1 million in 2024 to $153.2 million in 2025, or 0.1%.\n•\nRest of world SPINRAZA revenue decreased $7.5 million, from $228.3 million in 2024 to $220.8 million in 2025, or 3.3%, partially due to lower demand and pricing adjustments during the third quarter of 2025, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange.\n•\nGlobal SKYCLARYS revenue increased $30.6 million, from $102.3 million in 2024 to $132.9 million in 2025, or 29.9%, primarily related to an increase in rest of world sales volumes driven by the continued launch in Europe and certain markets in the Middle East, partially offset by an unfavorable Medicare-related adjustment in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2025 resulting from the IRA redesign.\n•\nGlobal QALSODY revenue increased $15.3 million, from $11.1 million in 2024 to $26.4 million in 2025, or 137.8%, primarily related to an increase in rest of world sales volumes driven by the continued launch in international markets.\n•\nU.S. SPINRAZA revenue decreased $2.0 million, from $458.9 million in 2024 to $456.9 million in 2025, or 0.4%.\n•\nRest of world SPINRAZA revenue increased $40.8 million, from $692.9 million in 2024 to $733.7 million in 2025, or 5.9%, partially due to a one-time VAT refund received in 2025 of approximately $18.1 million and the timing of shipments in rest of world markets, partially offset by lower demand and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange.\n•\nGlobal SKYCLARYS revenue increased $106.8 million, from $280.3 million in 2024 to $387.1 million in 2025, or 38.1%, primarily related to an increase in rest of world sales volumes driven by the continued launch in Europe and certain markets in the Middle East.\n•\nGlobal QALSODY revenue\n \nincreased $41.2 million, from $20.7 million in 2024 to $61.9 million in 2025, or 199.0%, primarily related to an increase in rest of world sales volumes driven by the continued launch in international markets.\nRare disease revenue includes sales from SPINRAZA, QALSODY and SKYCLARYS, which became commercially available in the E.U. during the first quarter of 2024.\nIn 2025 we expect growth in rare disease revenue as we continue to launch SKYCLARYS in the U.S., Europe and in certain rest of world markets. We anticipate global SPINRAZA revenue growth to be relatively flat in 2025.\n66\nTable of Contents\nBIOSIMILARS\n•\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period of 2024, the increase in biosimilar revenue was primarily due to an increase in pricing driven by a one-time VAT refund received during the third quarter of 2025. The increase was offset by a decrease in sales volumes related to IMRALDI.\n•\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, the decrease in biosimilar revenue was primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes related to IMRALDI, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange and a decrease in pricing due to competitive pressures in Europe\n.\nBiosimilars revenue includes sales from BENEPALI, IMRALDI, FLIXABI, BYOOVIZ and TOFIDENCE. In 2025 we completed the sale of our rights to TOFIDENCE and BYOOVIZ.\nWe continue to work with our third-party contract manufacturers for IMRALDI and BENEPALI to address supply constraints. If not resolved these supply constraints could have an adverse impact on 2025 sales. In addition, one of our contract manufacturers for IMRALDI and BENEPALI was acquired by a third party in December 2024. We have evaluated the impact this will have on our biosimilars business and have mitigation activities in progress designed to ensure supply continuity.\n67\nTable of Contents\nREVENUE FROM ANTI-CD20 THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS\nOur share of RITUXAN, including RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO collaboration operating profits in the U.S., royalty revenue on sales of OCREVUS and other revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs are summarized in the table below.

Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is generally expected to be the following quarter.\nBIOGEN'S SHARE OF PRE-TAX PROFITS IN THE U.S. FOR RITUXAN, GAZYVA AND LUNSUMIO\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, the increases in our share of pre-tax profits in the U.S. for RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO were primarily due to increases in sales volumes of GAZYVA of 8.7% and 12.9%, respectively.\nOTHER REVENUE FROM ANTI-CD20 THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS\nOther revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs consists of our share of pre-tax co-promotion profits from RITUXAN in Canada, royalty revenue on sales of LUNSUMIO outside the U.S. and royalty revenue on net sales of COLUMVI in the U.S.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, including information regarding the pre-tax profit-sharing formula and its impact on future revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships,\n to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nALZHEIMER'S COLLABORATION REVENUE\nAlzheimer's collaboration revenue consists of our 50.0% share of LEQEMBI product revenue, net and cost of sales, including royalties, as we are not the principal. We began recognizing Alzheimer's collaboration revenue upon the accelerated approval of LEQEMBI in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2023.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recognized Alzheimer's collaboration revenue of approximately $42.7 million and $130.6 million, respectively, compared to $18.6 million and $33.2 million, respectively, in the prior year comparative periods. The increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes driven by the continued launch of LEQEMBI in the U.S. and international markets.\nAdditionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Alzheimer's collaboration revenue reflects the favorable impact from the timing of shipments to China during the second quarter of 2025 as we optimized our global inventory positions.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Eisai, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, \nto our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n68\nTable of Contents\nCONTRACT MANUFACTURING, ROYALTY AND OTHER REVENUE\nContract manufacturing, royalty and other revenue is summarized as follows:\n \nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nContract manufacturing revenue\n$\n141.5 \n$\n221.9 \n$\n648.8 \n$\n474.1 \nRoyalty and other revenue\n9.7 \n9.7 \n40.3 \n48.3 \nTotal contract manufacturing, royalty and other revenue\n$\n151.2 \n$\n231.6 \n$\n689.1 \n$\n522.4 \nCONTRACT MANUFACTURING REVENUE\nContract manufacturing revenue primarily reflects amounts earned under contract manufacturing agreements with our strategic customers and batches of LEQEMBI related to our collaboration with Eisai.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, the decrease in contract manufacturing revenue was primarily due to lower manufacturing batch releases during the third quarter of 2025 driven by the acceleration of timing for manufacturing batch releases during the first half of 2025, as discussed below.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, the increase in contract manufacturing revenue was primarily driven by the accelerated timing of certain batch commitments related to our contract manufacturing business during the first half of 2025 in preparation for expected plant maintenance activities in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nFull-year contract manufacturing revenue for 2025 is anticipated to remain relatively flat when compared to 2024, due in part to planned plant maintenance activities in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nROYALTY AND OTHER REVENUE\nRoyalty and other revenue primarily reflects royalty revenue on biosimilar products from our license arrangements with Samsung Bioepis and royalties we receive from net sales on products related to patents that we have out-licensed.\nFor additional information on our license arrangements with Samsung Bioepis and our collaboration arrangements with Eisai, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, \nto our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nRESERVES FOR DISCOUNTS AND ALLOWANCES\nRevenue from product sales is recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain international markets where we operate.\nWe expect the IRA's drug pricing controls and Medicare Part D redesign may have an adverse impact on our full-year sales, particularly for our products that are more substantially reliant on Medicare reimbursement. We anticipate the IRA Medicare Part D redesign will have a modest net unfavorable impact to our 2025 revenue, ranging from approximately $50.0 million to $100.0 million, concentrated in our SKYCLARYS and MS portfolio product revenue, approximately a third of which could be associated with SKYCLARYS. \nThe degree of impact from this legislation on our business depends on a number of forthcoming implementation actions by regulatory authorities, which may be further impacted by other legislative acts that may modify or replace the IRA, such as the OBBBA. The full extent of the IRA's impacts on our sales and, in turn, our business, remains uncertain.\n69\nTable of Contents\nReserves for discounts, contractual adjustments and returns that reduced gross product revenue are summarized as follows:\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nContractual adjustments\n$\n632.2 \n$\n643.2 \n$\n1,970.6 \n$\n1,971.1 \nDiscounts\n213.7 \n207.8 \n609.2 \n612.7 \nReturns\n3.5 \n5.4 \n21.7 \n28.7 \nTotal discounts and allowances\n$\n849.4 \n$\n856.4 \n$\n2,601.5 \n$\n2,612.5 \nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, reserves for discounts and allowances as a percentage of gross product revenue were 31.2% and 32.0%, respectively, compared to 32.6% and 32.4%, respectively, in the prior year comparative periods. \nCONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS\nContractual adjustments primarily relate to Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S., pharmacy rebates, co-payment (copay) assistance, VA, 340B discounts, specialty pharmacy program fees and other government rebates or applicable allowances.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, the decreases in contractual adjustments were driven by favorable changes in estimates of approximately $45.0 million and $105.0 million, respectively, primarily due to lower managed care rebates, as well as lower co-pay assistance and Medicaid rebates in the U.S., offset in part by higher Medicare manufacturer reserves driven by the IRA Medicare Part D redesign and higher government rebates in rest of world.\nDISCOUNTS\nDiscounts include trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives and volume related discounts.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, the increase in discounts was primarily driven by higher volume discounts in the U.S. and rest of world for TYSABRI, partially offset by lower purchase discounts in rest of world.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, the decrease in discounts was primarily driven by lower purchase discounts in rest of world and lower volume discounts for U.S. biosimilars, partially offset by higher volume discounts in the U.S. for TYSABRI.\nRETURNS\nProduct return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Provisions for estimated product returns are recognized in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, the decreases in returns were primarily driven by lower returns in the U.S., partially offset by higher returns in rest of world.\nFor additional information on our revenue reserves, please read \nNote 5, Revenue,\n to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n70\nTable of Contents\nCOST AND EXPENSE\nA summary of total cost and expense is as follows:\n \nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions, except percentages)\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nCost of sales, excluding amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets\n$\n674.4 \n$\n638.7 \n$\n35.7 \n5.6 \n%\nResearch and development\n436.1 \n516.2 \n(80.1)\n(15.5)\nAcquired in-process research and development, upfront and milestone expense\n2.1 \n26.5 \n(24.4)\n(92.1)\nSelling, general and administrative\n594.8 \n588.4 \n6.4 \n1.1 \nAmortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets\n135.7 \n130.3 \n5.4 \n4.1 \nCollaboration profit sharing/(loss reimbursement)\n87.2 \n69.3 \n17.9 \n25.8 \n(Gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration\n5.6 \n23.8 \n(18.2)\n(76.5)\nRestructuring charges\n7.4 \n6.8 \n0.6 \n8.8 \nOther (income) expense, net\n34.1 \n14.8 \n19.3 \n130.4 \nTotal cost and expense\n$\n1,977.4 \n$\n2,014.8 \n$\n(37.4)\n(1.9)\n%\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions, except percentages)\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nCost of sales, excluding amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets\n$\n1,908.7 \n$\n1,726.9 \n$\n181.8 \n10.5 \n%\nResearch and development\n1,269.2 \n1,467.0 \n(197.8)\n(13.5)\nAcquired in-process research and development, upfront and milestone expense\n249.4 \n42.5 \n206.9 \n486.8 \nSelling, general and administrative\n1,751.1 \n1,723.7 \n27.4 \n1.6 \nAmortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets\n378.4 \n295.5 \n82.9 \n28.1 \nCollaboration profit sharing/(loss reimbursement)\n220.3 \n197.3 \n23.0 \n11.7 \n(Gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration\n28.4 \n23.8 \n4.6 \n19.3 \nRestructuring charges\n42.0 \n24.9 \n17.1 \n68.7 \nGain on sale of priority review voucher, net\n— \n(88.6)\n88.6 \nnm\nOther (income) expense, net\n151.2 \n193.7 \n(42.5)\n(21.9)\nTotal cost and expense\n$\n5,998.7 \n$\n5,606.7 \n$\n392.0 \n7.0 \n%\nnm\n Not meaningful\n71\nTable of Contents\nCOST OF SALES, EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nProduct\n$\n384.0 \n$\n468.2 \n$\n1,261.2 \n$\n1,204.3 \nRoyalty\n290.4 \n170.5 \n647.5 \n522.6 \nTotal cost of sales\n$\n674.4 \n$\n638.7 \n$\n1,908.7 \n$\n1,726.9 \nPRODUCT COST OF SALES\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, the decrease in product cost of sales was primarily due to lower cost of contract manufacturing revenue driven by the timing of batch releases and lower inventory write-offs, partially offset by higher SKYCLARYS inventory step-up amortization costs.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, the increase in product cost of sales was primarily due to higher contract manufacturing revenue driven by the timing of batch releases and higher SKYCLARYS inventory step-up amortization costs, partially offset by lower inventory write-offs.\nContract manufacturing revenue includes LEQEMBI inventory produced for Eisai. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was adversely affected by LEQEMBI batches due to lower margins associated with this business.\nAs a result of our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we recorded a fair value step-up adjustment related to the acquired inventory of SKYCLARYS. This fair value step-up adjustment is being amortized to cost of sales within our condensed consolidated statements of income as the inventory is sold or used for clinical purposes. We expect this amount to be fully amortized by the end of 2028. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, amortization from the fair value step-up adjustment was approximately $61.5 million and $165.4 million, respectively, compared to $48.4 million and $136.6 million, respectively, in the prior year comparative periods.\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Eisai, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, \nto our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.

For additional information on our litigation matters, please read \nNote 21, Litigation\n, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n72\nTable of Contents\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nResearch and development expense, as a percentage of total revenue, was 17.2% and 20.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, the decrease in research and development was primarily driven by continued cost reduction measures realized in connection with our portfolio prioritization initiatives and our Fit for Growth program as well as $42.5 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized in 2024 related to the HI-Bio acquisition. This decrease was offset in part by higher spend on clinical trials, including litifilimab and felzartamab. Higher clinical trial spend related to litifilimab was offset by $50.0 million in research and development funding received from Royalty Pharma.\nEARLY STAGE PROGRAMS\nQ3 2025 vs. Q3 2024\nThe decrease in early stage program expense was driven by a decrease in costs associated with:\n•\nadvancement of felzartamab for AMR, IgAN and PMN to late stage.\nThe decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with:\n•\ndevelopment of salanersen for the treatment of SMA\nLATE STAGE PROGRAMS\nQ3 2025 vs. Q3 2024\nThe increase in late stage program expense was driven by an increase in costs associated with:\n•\nthe development of felzartamab for AMR, IgAN and PMN; and\n•\ndevelopment of litifilimab for the treatment of CLE and SLE, offset by Royalty Pharma funding of $50.0 million.\nMARKETED PROGRAMS\nQ3 2025 vs. Q3 2024\nThe decrease in marketed program expense was driven by a decrease in costs associated with:\n•\ndecreased spend on LEQEMBI for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\nThe decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with:\n•\ni\nncreased spend on SKYCLARYS for the treatment of pediatric FA.\n73\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expense, as a percentage of total revenue, was 16.7% and 20.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, the decrease in research and development was primarily driven by continued cost reduction measures realized in connection with our portfolio prioritization initiatives and our Fit for Growth program, approximately $48.5 million of step-up amortization related to SKYCLARYS inventory recorded in the second quarter of 2024 and approximately $42.5 million of equity-based compensation expense recognized in 2024 related to the HI-Bio acquisition. This decrease was offset in part by higher spend on clinical trials, including litifilimab and felzartamab. Higher clinical trial spend related to litifilimab was offset by $150.0 million in research and development funding received from Royalty Pharma.\nEARLY STAGE PROGRAMS\nYTD 2025 vs. YTD 2024\nThe decrease in early stage programs was driven by a decrease in costs associated with:\n•\ndiscontinuation of BIIB121 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome;\n•\nadvancement of litifilimab for the treatment of CLE into late stage;\n•\ndiscontinuation of BIIB143 for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain; and\n•\ndiscontinuation of BIIB105 for the treatment of ALS.\nThe decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with:\n•\ndevelopment of BIIB080 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; \n•\ndevelopment of salanersen for the treatment of SMA;\n•\ndevelopment of felzartamab for IgAN and PMN prior to advancement to late stage; and\n•\ndevelopment of felzartamab for lupus nephritis.\nLATE STAGE PROGRAMS\nYTD 2025 vs. YTD 2024\nThe increase in late stage programs was driven by an increase in costs associated with:\n•\ndevelopment of felzartamab for AMR, IgAN and PMN; and\n•\ndevelopment of litifilimab for the treatment of CLE and SLE, offset by Royalty Pharma funding of $150.0 million.\nMARKETED PROGRAMS\nYTD 2025 vs. YTD 2024\nThe decrease in marketed programs was driven by a decrease in costs associated with:\n•\ndecreased spend on LEQEMBI for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; and\n•\n$48.5 million of step-up amortization related to S\nKYCLARYS inventory recorded in the prior year comparative period.\n74\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expense is reported above based on the following classifications. The development stage reported is based upon the program status when incurred. Therefore, the same program could be reflected in different development stages in the same year. For several of our programs, the research and development activities are part of our collaborative and other relationships. Our costs reflect our share of the total costs incurred.\n•\nResearch and discovery:\n represents costs incurred to support our discovery research and translational science efforts. \n•\nEarly stage programs:\n are programs in Phase 1 or Phase 2 development.\n•\nLate stage programs:\n are programs in Phase 3 development or in registration stage.\n•\nMarketed products:\n includes costs associated with product lifecycle management activities including, if applicable, costs associated with the development of new indications for existing products.\n•\nOther research and development costs:\n A significant amount of our research and development costs consist of indirect costs incurred in support of overall research and development activities and non-specific programs, including activities that benefit multiple programs, such as management costs, as well as depreciation, information technology and facility-based expenses. These costs are considered other research and development costs in the table above and are not allocated to a specific program or stage.\nWe expect our core research and development expense to decrease in 2025, due to our portfolio prioritization initiatives, our Fit for Growth program and the research and development funding received from Royalty Pharma. We intend to continue committing significant resources to targeted research and development opportunities while continuing to invest in our pipeline, such as our acquisition of HI-Bio in July 2024, where there is a significant unmet need and where a drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated.\nACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, UPFRONT AND MILESTONE EXPENSE\nDuring the first quarter of 2025 we began presenting acquired in-process research and development, upfront and milestone expense as a separate line item in our condensed consolidated statements of income. Acquired in-process research and development, upfront and milestone expense includes costs incurred in connection with collaboration and license agreements such as upfront and milestone payments and, when applicable, premiums on equity securities and asset acquisitions of acquired in-process research and development, which were previously included in research and development expense.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, the increase in acquired in-process research and development, upfront and milestone expense was primarily due to a $30.0 million milestone payment to MorphoSys accrued during the second quarter of 2025 in connection with the first patient dosed in a Phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab for the treatment of IgAN, a $16.0 million upfront payment made to City Therapeutics in connection with the closing of our strategic research arrangement in May 2025, a $165.0 million upfront payment made to Stoke in connection with the closing of our collaboration and license agreement in February 2025, as well as a $35.0 million milestone payment to MorphoSys accrued during the first quarter of 2025 in connection with the first patient dosed in a Phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab for the treatment of AMR.\nFor additional information on our arrangements with Stoke, MorphoSys and City Therapeutics, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships,\n to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, selling, general and administrative expense increased by approximately 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively, primarily due to increases in operational spending on sales and marketing activities in support of LEQEMBI and SKYCLARYS as we continue to expand our U.S. and international product launches. The increases were partially offset by the realization of our cost-reduction measures in connection with our Fit for Growth program.\nWe expect a slight increase in full-year 2025 selling, general and administrative expense, as compared to full-year 2024, due to continued spend related to LEQEMBI and SKYCLARYS product launches in the U.S. and international markets.\nAMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nOur amortization expense is based on the economic consumption and impairment of intangible assets. Our most significant amortizable intangible assets are related to TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY and SKYCLARYS.\n75\nTable of Contents\nFor the three and \nnine \nmonths ended September 30, 2025, amortization of acquired intangible assets, excluding impairment charges, totaled \n$135.7 million and $374.9 million, respectively, \ncompared to \n$110.1 million and $275.3 million, respectively, in the prior year comparative periods. The increases were primarily due to amortization for the acquired intangible assets associated with SKYCLARYS and TYSABRI.\nFor the \nthree months ended \nSeptember 30, 2025, we had no impairment charges. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impact of a $3.5 million impairment charge related to a compound acquired from HI-Bio. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects impairment charges of approximately $20.2 million related to intangible assets associated with the termination of Samsung Bioepis' commercialization rights during the third quarter of 2024.\nFor additional information on the amortization and impairment of our acquired intangible assets, please read \nNote 7, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nCOLLABORATION PROFIT SHARING/(LOSS REIMBURSEMENT)\nCollaboration profit sharing/(loss reimbursement) includes Samsung Bioepis' 50.0% share of the profit or loss related to our biosimilars 2013 commercial agreement with Samsung Bioepis and collaboration profit sharing/(loss reimbursement) related to Supernus' 50.0% share of the profit or loss in the U.S. related to ZURZUVAE for PPD.\nFor the \nthree and \nnine months ended September 30, 2025, we recognized net profit-sharing expense of approximately $66.5 million and $171.7 million, respectively, to reflect Samsung Bioepis' 50.0% sharing of the net collaboration profits, compared to net profit-sharing expense of approximately $60.3 million and $176.8 million, respectively, in the prior year comparative periods.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recognized net profit-sharing expense of approximately $20.7 million and $48.6 million, respectively, to reflect Supernus' 50.0% share of the net collaboration results in the U.S., compared to net profit-sharing expense of approximately $9.0 million and $20.5 million, respectively, in the prior year comparative periods.\nFor additional information on our collaboration and license arrangements with Samsung Bioepis and Supernus, please read \nNote 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships,\n to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n(GAIN) LOSS ON FAIR VALUE REMEASUREMENT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION\nConsideration payable for certain of our business combinations include future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event or events. We record an obligation for such contingent consideration payments at fair value on the acquisition date. We then revalue our contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations, other than changes due to payments, are recognized as a (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration in our condensed consolidated statements of income. In connection with our acquisition of HI-Bio in July 2024 we recorded contingent consideration obligations related to potential milestone payments.\nFor the three \nand \nnine months ended September 30, 2025, changes in fair value of our contingent consideration obligations were primarily due to the passage of time.\nDuring the second quarter of 2025 the first milestone related to the fourth patient dosed in a phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab for AMR was achieved, resulting in a $150.0 million milestone payment made to the former shareholders of HI-Bio, which was paid during the third quarter of 2025. In October 2025 the second milestone related to the fourth patient dosed in a phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab for IgAN was achieved, resulting in a $150.0 million milestone payment to be made to the former shareholders of HI-Bio, which we expect will be paid during the fourth quarter of 2025.\nFor additional information on our acquisition of HI-Bio, please read \nNote 2, Acquisitions\n, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n76\nTable of Contents\nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES\n2023 FIT FOR GROWTH RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM\nIn 2023 we initiated cost saving measures as part of our Fit for Growth program to reduce operating costs, while improving operating efficiency and effectiveness. The Fit for Growth program is expected to generate approximately $1.0 billion in gross operating expense savings by the end of 2025, some of which will be reinvested in various initiatives. The Fit for Growth program is currently estimated to include net headcount reductions of approximately 1,400 employees and we expect to incur total restructuring charges of approximately $310.0 million, which were substantially achieved as of September 30, 2025.\nTotal charges incurred from our 2023 Fit for Growth program are summarized as follows:\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n(In millions)\nSeverance\nCosts\nAccelerated Depreciation and Other Costs\nTotal\nSeverance Costs\nAccumulated Depreciation and Other Costs\nTotal\nSelling, general and administrative\n$\n— \n$\n0.4 \n$\n0.4 \n$\n— \n$\n9.1 \n$\n9.1 \nResearch and development\n— \n0.5 \n0.5 \n— \n3.5 \n3.5 \nRestructuring charges\n7.4 \n— \n7.4 \n4.6 \n— \n4.6 \nTotal charges\n$\n7.4 \n$\n0.9 \n$\n8.3 \n$\n4.6 \n$\n12.6 \n$\n17.2 \nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n(In millions)\nSeverance Costs\nAccelerated Depreciation and Other Costs\nTotal\nSeverance Costs\nAccumulated Depreciation and Other Costs\nTotal\nSelling, general and administrative\n$\n— \n$\n(2.8)\n$\n(2.8)\n$\n— \n$\n12.5 \n$\n12.5 \nResearch and development\n— \n6.9 \n6.9 \n— \n10.6 \n10.6 \nRestructuring charges\n41.6 \n— \n41.6 \n20.2 \n— \n20.2 \nTotal charges\n$\n41.6 \n$\n4.1 \n$\n45.7 \n$\n20.2 \n$\n23.1 \n$\n43.3 \nOther Costs:\n Includes costs associated with items such as asset abandonment and write-offs, facility closure costs, pre-tax gains and losses resulting from the termination of certain leases, employee non-severance expense, consulting fees and other costs.\nFor additional information on our cost saving initiatives, please read \nNote 4, Restructuring,\n to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, the change in other (income) expense, net primarily reflects higher net gains on our holdings in equity securities in 2024, compared to net losses in 2025, as well as higher interest income in 2025 driven by higher cash balances.\nFor the\n \nnine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, the change in other (income) expense, net primarily reflects higher interest income in 2025 driven by higher cash balances.\nWe expect net interest expense will decrease as a result of higher interest income in 2025 driven by higher cash balances, partially offset by higher interest expense as a result of the issuance of our 2025 Senior Notes. For additional information related to our 2025 Senior Notes, please read \nNote 13, Indebtedness\n, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nNET (GAINS) LOSSES IN EQUITY SECURITIES\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, net unrealized gains and realized losses on our holdings in equity securities were approximately $3.2 million and $7.0 million, respectively, compared to net unrealized and realized gains of approximately $28.2 million and $10.9 million, respectively, in the prior year comparative period. \n•\nThe net unrealized gains recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2025, primarily reflect an increase in the aggregate fair value of our investment in Denali common stock of approximately $3.8 million.\n77\nTable of Contents\n•\nThe net unrealized gains recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflect an increase in the aggregate fair value of our investments in Denali and Sangamo common stock of approximately $53.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of Sage common stock of approximately $22.7 million.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net unrealized and realized losses on our holdings in equity securities were approximately $32.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively, compared to net unrealized losses and realized gains of approximately $27.3 million and $5.4 million, respectively, in the prior year comparative period.\n•\nThe net unrealized losses recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily reflect a decrease in the aggregate fair value of our investment in Denali common stock of approximately $41.9 million, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of Sage common stock of approximately $23.0 million.\n•\nThe net unrealized losses recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflect a decrease in the aggregate fair value of our investments in Sage common stock of approximately $90.2 million, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of Denali and Sangamo common stock of approximately $70.1 million.\nINCOME TAX PROVISION\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions, except percentages)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nIncome before income tax (benefit) expense\n$\n557.3 \n$\n451.0 \n$\n1,612.5 \n$\n1,614.5 \nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n90.8 \n62.5 \n270.7 \n249.0 \nEffective tax rate\n16.3 \n%\n13.9 \n%\n16.8 \n%\n15.4 \n%\nOur effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the global nature of our operations. The factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include changes in tax laws, variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings among multiple jurisdictions, the amount and characterization of our research and development expense, the levels of certain deductions and credits, acquisitions and licensing transactions.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, the increases in our effective tax rates were partially driven by changes in the territorial mix of our profitability, partially offset by the impact of the OBBBA enactment.\nThe nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, also reflects the impacts of certain share-based compensation awards that vested during the first quarter of 2025 and a decrease in our estimate of Pillar Two minimum tax liabilities.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rates benefited from a decrease in our valuation allowance, partially offset by the impact of certain foreign uncertain tax positions. \nPILLAR TWO\nThe OECD has issued model rules, which generally provide for a jurisdictional minimum effective tax rate of 15.0% as defined in those rules. Various countries have or are in the process of enacting legislation intended to implement the principles. Our income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, reflects currently enacted legislation and guidance related to the OECD model rules. This enacted legislation and guidance related to the OECD model rules did not result in any material adjustments to our income tax provision or income tax balances as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. On June 28, 2025, the G7 issued a statement stating that the G7 will work with the OECD to adjust the model rules such that the model rules would work side-by-side with the U.S. GILTI tax. At this stage, we do not believe the G7 statement impacts our financial results as of September 30, 2025.\n78\nTable of Contents\n2025 OBBBA TAX PROVISIONS\nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. signed into law the OBBBA. The OBBBA contains tax provisions, such as the permanent extension or revision of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, modifications to the international tax framework and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The provisions of the OBBBA have multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through 2027.\nThe OBBBA did not result in any material adjustments to our total income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, and we have adjusted our deferred tax balances to reflect the impacts of the OBBBA enactment. However, given the complexity of tax laws, related regulations and interpretations, our current estimates may require revision as additional information becomes available regarding the application of the OBBBA provisions.\nFor additional information on our income taxes, please read \nNote 17, Income Taxes\n, to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur financial condition is summarized as follows:\n(In millions, except percentages)\nAs of September 30, 2025\nAs of December 31, 2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n3,862.8 \n$\n2,375.0 \n$\n1,487.8 \n62.6 \n%\nMarketable securities — current\n97.6 \n— \n97.6 \nnm\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n$\n3,960.4 \n$\n2,375.0 \n$\n1,585.4 \n66.8 \n%\nBorrowings:\nCurrent portion notes payable\n$\n— \n$\n1,748.6 \n$\n(1,748.6)\nnm\nNotes payable\n6,285.1 \n4,547.2 \n1,737.9 \n38.2 \nTotal borrowings\n$\n6,285.1 \n$\n6,295.8 \n$\n(10.7)\n(0.2)\n%\nWorking capital:\nCurrent assets\n$\n8,936.6 \n$\n7,456.8 \n$\n1,479.8 \n19.8 \n%\nCurrent liabilities\n(3,290.0)\n(5,528.8)\n2,238.8 \n(40.5)\nTotal working capital\n$\n5,646.6 \n$\n1,928.0 \n$\n3,718.6 \n192.9 \n%\nnm\n Not meaningful\nOVERVIEW\nWe have historically financed and expect to continue to fund our operating and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow earned through our operations and borrowings, as well as our existing cash resources. We believe that generic and biosimilar competition for many of our key products, the continued overall decline of our MS business and our investments in the launch of key new products and the development of our pipeline will have a significant adverse impact on our future cash flow from operations.\nWe believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to additional financing resources, if needed, are sufficient to satisfy our operating, working capital, strategic alliance, milestone payment, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we may choose to opportunistically return cash to shareholders and pursue other business initiatives, including acquisition and licensing activities. We may also seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources should we identify a significant new opportunity.\nDuring the second quarter of 2025 the first milestone related to the fourth patient dosed in a phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab for AMR was achieved, resulting in a $150.0 million milestone payment made to the former shareholders of HI-Bio, which was paid during the third quarter of 2025. In October 2025 the second milestone related to the fourth patient dosed in a phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab for IgAN was achieved, resulting in a $150.0 million milestone payment to be made to the former shareholders of HI-Bio, which we expect will be paid during the fourth quarter of 2025.\n79\nTable of Contents\nFor additional information on certain risks that could negatively impact our financial position or future results of operations, please read \nItem 1A.\n \nRisk Factors\n and"
