Forward-looking statements can often be identified by words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"intends,\" and similar expressions.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, are subject to risks and uncertainties, and may differ materially from actual results due to various factors, including those described under \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this report. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. Fiscal 2025 will end on February 1, 2026 and will be a 52-week year. Fiscal 2024 was a 53-week year and ended on February 2, 2025. Fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 are referred to as \"2025,\" and \"2024,\" respectively. The first two quarters of 2025 and 2024 ended on August 3, 2025 and July 28, 2024, respectively. \n20\nTable of Contents\nComponents of this MD&A include:\n•\nOverview\n•\nFinancial Highlights and Market Conditions and Trends\n•\nQuarter-to-Date Results of Operations\n•\nYear-to-Date Results of Operations\n•\nComparable Sales\n•\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n•\nSeasonality\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n•\nOperating Locations\nWe use comparable sales as a metric to evaluate the performance of our business. Due to the 53rd week in 2024, comparable sales are calculated on a one-week shifted basis such that the 13 or 26 weeks ended August 3, 2025 is compared to the 13 or 26 weeks ended August 4, 2024 rather than July 28, 2024. Refer to the Comparable Sales section of this MD&A for further information.\nWe provide constant dollar changes, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as supplemental information to help investors understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this MD&A for reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nWe disclose material non-public information through one or more of the following channels: our investor relations website (http://corporate.lululemon.com/investors), the social media channels identified on our investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts. Information contained on or accessible through our websites is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this Quarterly Report or any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nOverview\nlululemon athletica inc. is principally a designer, distributor, and retailer of technical athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories.

On a constant dollar basis, net revenue increased 6%.\n•\nComparable sales increased 1%.\n–\nAmericas comparable sales decreased 4%, or 3% on a constant dollar basis.\n–\nChina Mainland comparable sales increased 17%, or 16% on a constant dollar basis. \n–\nRest of World comparable sales increased 12%, or 9% on a constant dollar basis.\n•\nGross profit increased 5% to $1.5 billion. \n•\nGross margin decreased 110 basis points to 58.5%. \n•\nIncome from operations decreased 3% to $523.8 million. \n21\nTable of Contents\n•\nOperating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.7%. \n•\nIncome tax expense decreased 2% to $162.6 million. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2025 was 30.5% compared to 29.6% for the second quarter of 2024. \n•\nDiluted earnings per share were $3.10 compared to $3.15 in the second quarter of 2024. \nMarket Conditions and Trends\nAcross all markets, our business continues to be negatively influenced by macroeconomic conditions, including trade policies, shifting consumer demand, inflation, foreign currency fluctuations, and geopolitical instability. These factors have had varying effects across our markets and are expected to continue to impact our business throughout 2025 and beyond. \nWhile total net revenue increased across all regions in the second quarter of 2025, comparable sales in the Americas decreased 4%, or 3% on a constant dollar basis. We experienced lower conversion rates and store traffic in the Americas, partially reflective of economic uncertainty, lower consumer confidence, changes in discretionary spending, and certain product offerings experiencing lower demand.\nImport Tariffs\nOn April 2, 2025, the United States announced the implementation of a 10% baseline tariff on imports from nearly all countries with higher country-specific tariff rates scheduled to begin April 9, 2025. The implementation of country-specific tariffs was subsequently delayed to allow negotiations. Certain countries, including Vietnam, have announced trade deals with the United States and most negotiated tariff rates are higher than the 10% baseline rate. There has been significant volatility in U.S. tariff and customs policy, and trade negotiations between the United States and other countries are ongoing.\nThe United States also approved the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, 2025, which removed the de minimis exemption for low value shipments imported into the United States in 2027. On July 30, 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order removing the de minimis exemption for all countries beginning August 29, 2025. \nThese changes in the tariff landscape, including the de minimis removal, are expected to have a significant adverse effect on our business and results of operation. The countries from which we source the majority of our products are now subject to higher tariffs on imports into the United States. Further, the majority of our sales to U.S. e-commerce guests are currently fulfilled from distribution centers in Canada, and historically a significant proportion of these orders qualified for the de minimis exemption. The removal of this exemption increases the cost of fulfilling those orders. We are taking steps to mitigate the financial impact which includes vendor negotiations and selective price increases. These actions are not anticipated to fully offset the effect of higher tariffs and the removal of the de minimis exemption, and we anticipate a significant reduction in our gross margin and operating margin. \nThe impact of increased tariffs, net of mitigating activities, resulted in a reduction to gross profit for the first two quarters of 2025 of approximately $10 million. We estimate, based on the information available to us today, that increased tariffs, and the removal of the de minimis exemption, will reduce gross profit for 2025 by approximately $240 million, net of mitigation efforts.\nThis estimate is our best current view and may change materially as conditions evolve and new information becomes available. It reflects a number of assumptions including (i) the tariff rates and timing of implementation, (ii) the duration and scope of the de minimis exemption removal, (iii) the potential application of transshipment tariff rules, (iv) our ability to execute vendor savings, and (v) customer demand elasticity and pricing response. Actual results may differ materially from this estimate, whether because these assumptions prove inaccurate or because of subsequent changes in tariff policy, trade negotiations, sourcing conditions, consumer demand for our products, or other factors outside our control. \nBecause this is an evolving area, future developments may change our expectations materially. For additional information on related risks, please see “Risk Factors” in this quarterly report.\nOur updated forecasts, inclusive of the trends above, have resulted in changes in the probability of achieving performance conditions of performance-based restricted stock units. Therefore, we recognized a reversal of stock-based compensation expense of $26.3 million during the second quarter of 2025.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations\nForeign currency fluctuations negatively impacted our financial results during the first two quarters of 2025, reducing net revenue growth by $10.7 million compared to the first two quarters of 2024, primarily due to the overall appreciation of \n22\nTable of Contents\nthe US dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. We expect ongoing exchange rate volatility to continue affecting our financial results.\nQuarter-to-Date Results of Operations: Second Quarter Results\nThe following table summarizes key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated:\n \nSecond Quarter\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n \n(In thousands)\n(Percentage of net revenue)\nNet revenue\n$\n2,525,219 \n$\n2,371,078 \n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nCost of goods sold\n1,048,017 \n958,893 \n41.5 \n40.4 \nGross profit\n1,477,202 \n1,412,185 \n58.5 \n59.6 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n951,658 \n871,959 \n37.7 \n36.8 \nAmortization of intangible assets\n1,730 \n— \n0.1 \n— \nIncome from operations\n523,814 \n540,226 \n20.7 \n22.8 \nOther income (expense), net\n9,737 \n17,994 \n0.4 \n0.8 \nIncome before income tax expense\n533,551 \n558,220 \n21.1 \n23.5 \nIncome tax expense\n162,646 \n165,298 \n6.4 \n7.0 \nNet income\n$\n370,905 \n$\n392,922 \n14.7 \n%\n16.6 \n%\nNet Revenue\n \nSecond Quarter\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nYear over year change\n \n(In thousands)\n(Percentage of net revenue)\n(In thousands)\n(Percentage)\n(Constant dollar change)\nAmericas\n$\n1,758,217 \n$\n1,741,433 \n69.6 \n%\n73.4 \n%\n$\n16,784 \n1 \n%\n1 \n%\nChina Mainland\n392,898 \n314,189 \n15.6 \n13.3 \n78,709 \n25 \n%\n24 \n%\nRest of World\n374,104 \n315,456 \n14.8 \n13.3 \n58,648 \n19 \n%\n15 \n%\nNet revenue\n$\n2,525,219 \n$\n2,371,078 \n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\n$\n154,141 \n7 \n%\n6 \n%\nThe increase in net revenue was primarily due to increased China Mainland and Rest of World net revenue.

It allows us to monitor the performance of our business without the impact of recently opened or expanded stores. We believe investors also find these metrics useful in assessing performance. \nComparable sales includes comparable company-operated store and all e-commerce net revenue. E-commerce net revenue includes buy online pick-up in store, back-back room, and ship from store net revenue in addition to our websites, other region-specific websites, digital marketplaces, and mobile apps. Our back-back room capability allows our store educators to access inventory located at our other locations and have product shipped directly to a guest's address or a store. Comparable company-operated stores have been open, or open after being significantly expanded, for at least 12 full fiscal months. Net revenue from a company-operated store is included in comparable sales beginning with the first fiscal month for which the store has a full fiscal month of sales in the prior year. \nComparable sales excludes sales from:\n•\nnew stores that have not been open for at least 12 full fiscal months;\n•\nstores which have not been in their significantly expanded space for at least 12 full fiscal months;\n31\nTable of Contents\n•\nstores which have been temporarily relocated for renovations or temporarily closed;\n•\nsales from company-operated stores that have closed; and\n•\nsales from our selling channels other than company-operated stores and e-commerce. \nThe comparable sales measures we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nCompany-operated stores acquired as a result of the acquisition of the Mexico operations will be considered comparable beginning October 2025 after 12 full fiscal months of sales from the date of acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, wholesale sales were made to a third party under a license and supply arrangement. \nIn fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of comparable sales. In the year following a 53-week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report certain financial metrics on a constant dollar basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nA constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We use constant dollar metrics to facilitate comparison of underlying performance excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management uses these constant currency metrics internally when reviewing and assessing financial performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not a substitute for, the corresponding financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nConstant Dollar Changes\nThe below changes in net revenue show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. Due to the 53rd week in 2024, the below changes in comparable sales are calculated on a one-week shifted basis such that the 13 or 26 weeks ended August 3, 2025 is compared to the 13 or 26 weeks ended August 4, 2024 rather than July 28, 2024.\nSecond Quarter 2025\nFirst Two Quarters 2025 \nChange\nForeign exchange changes\nChange in constant dollars\nChange\nForeign exchange changes\nChange in constant dollars\nNet Revenue\nAmericas\n1 \n%\n— \n%\n1 \n%\n2 \n%\n1 \n%\n3 \n%\nChina Mainland\n25 \n(1)\n24 \n23 \n— \n23 \nRest of World\n19 \n(4)\n15 \n17 \n(1)\n16 \nTotal net revenue\n7 \n%\n(1)\n%\n6 \n%\n7 \n%\n— \n%\n7 \n%\nComparable sales\n(1)\n \nAmericas\n(4)\n%\n1 \n%\n(3)\n%\n(3)\n%\n1 \n%\n(2)\n%\nChina Mainland\n17 \n(1)\n16 \n12 \n— \n12 \nRest of World\n12 \n(3)\n9 \n9 \n(1)\n8 \nTotal comparable sales\n1 \n%\n— \n%\n1 \n%\n1 \n%\n— \n%\n1 \n%\n__________\n(1)\nComparable sales includes comparable company-operated store and e-commerce net revenue.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the retail apparel industry. Our annual net revenue is typically weighted more heavily toward our fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the holiday \n32\nTable of Contents\nseason in the Americas, while our operating expenses are generally more equally distributed throughout the year. As a result, a substantial portion of our operating profits are typically generated in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. For example, we generated approximately 42% of our full year operating profit during the fourth quarter of 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and capacity under our committed revolving credit facility, including to fund short-term working capital requirements. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling or relocating existing stores, investing in our distribution centers, investing in technology and making system enhancements, funding working capital requirements, and making other strategic capital investments. We may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions, as well as in money market funds and term deposits.\nThe following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated:\nFirst Two Quarters\n2025\n2024\nYear over year change\n(In thousands)\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n209,722 \n$\n570,664 \n$\n(360,942)\nInvesting activities\n(319,960)\n(266,625)\n(53,335)\nFinancing activities\n(744,823)\n(916,543)\n171,720 \nEffect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n26,519 \n(21,355)\n47,874 \nDecrease in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(828,542)\n$\n(633,859)\n$\n(194,683)\nOperating Activities\nNet income decreased $28.9 million. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $341.8 million, primarily driven by the timing of income tax payments, accrued liabilities driven by changes in the value of forward currency contracts, and inventory purchases, partially offset by the timing of accounts payable and changes in accrued compensation. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by increased depreciation, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense.\nInvesting Activities\nThe increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increased capital expenditures and the settlement of net investment hedges, partially offset by a decrease in other investing activities. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to increased capital expenditures for company-operated stores in the Americas, partially offset by a decrease in corporate and supply chain infrastructure capital expenditures. \nFinancing Activities\nThe decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in our stock repurchases. During the first two quarters of 2025, we repurchased 2.5 million shares at a total cost including commissions and excise taxes of $715.7 million. During the first two quarters of 2024, we repurchased 2.6 million shares at a total cost including commissions and excise taxes of $888.9 million. The common stock was repurchased in the open market at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depending upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors. \nLiquidity Outlook\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our committed revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products, as well as the other factors described in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\". In addition, we may make discretionary \n33\nTable of Contents\ncapital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, or we may repurchase shares under an approved stock repurchase program, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.\nThe following table includes certain measures of our liquidity:\nAugust 3, 2025\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,155,794 \nWorking capital\n(1)\n excluding cash and cash equivalents\n815,588 \nCapacity under committed revolving credit facility\n393,242 \n_________\n(1)\nWorking capital is calculated as current assets of $3.5 billion less current liabilities of $1.6 billion.\nWe enter into standby letters of credit and guarantee to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes, and duties. As of August 3, 2025, letters of credit and guarantee totaling $14.3 million had been issued, including $6.8 million under our committed revolving credit facility. \nOur existing Americas credit facility provides for $400.0 million in commitments under an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility. The credit facility has a maturity date of December 14, 2026. As of August 3, 2025, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility other than letters of credit and guarantee of $6.8 million. Further information regarding our credit facilities and associated covenants is outlined in Note 3. Revolving Credit Facilities included in Item 1 of Part I of this report.\nThe timing and cost of our inventory purchases will vary depending on a variety of factors such as revenue growth, assortment and purchasing decisions, product costs including freight and duty, and the availability of production capacity and speed. Our inventory balance as of August 3, 2025 was $1.7 billion, an increase of 21% from July 28, 2024. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of significant judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. \nOur critical accounting policies, estimates, and judgements are discussed within \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 27, 2025. \n34\nTable of Contents\nOperating Locations \nOur company-operated stores by market as of August 3, 2025 and February 2, 2025 are summarized in the table below. \nNumber of company-operated stores by market\nAugust 3,\n2025\nFebruary 2,\n2025\nUnited States\n377 \n374 \nCanada\n72 \n71 \nMexico\n18 \n17 \nAmericas\n467 \n462 \nChina Mainland\n159 \n151 \nAustralia\n33 \n33 \nSouth Korea\n20 \n20 \nHong Kong SAR\n10 \n10 \nJapan\n10 \n10 \nSingapore\n9 \n7 \nNew Zealand\n8 \n8 \nTaiwan\n8 \n8 \nMalaysia\n5 \n5 \nThailand\n4 \n4 \nMacau SAR\n2 \n2 \nAPAC\n109 \n107 \nUnited Kingdom\n20 \n19 \nGermany\n9 \n9 \nFrance\n6 \n6 \nIreland\n4 \n4 \nSpain\n3 \n3 \nNetherlands\n2 \n2 \nSweden\n2 \n2 \nItaly\n1 \n— \nNorway\n1 \n1 \nSwitzerland\n1 \n1 \nEMEA\n49 \n47 \nTotal company-operated stores\n784 \n767 \n35\nTable of Contents\nRetail locations operated by third parties by market as of August 3, 2025 and February 2, 2025 are summarized in the table below. \nNumber of retail locations operated by third parties by market\nAugust 3,\n2025\nFebruary 2,\n2025\nUnited Arab Emirates\n11 \n10 \nSaudi Arabia\n9 \n8 \nIsrael\n8 \n7 \nKuwait\n4 \n4 \nQatar\n4 \n4 \nTurkey\n2 \n— \nBahrain\n1 \n1 \nBelgium\n1 \n— \nDenmark\n1 \n— \nTotal locations operated by third parties under license and supply arrangements\n41 \n34"
