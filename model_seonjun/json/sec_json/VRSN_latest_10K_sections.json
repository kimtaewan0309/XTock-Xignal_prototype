We help enable the security, stability, and resiliency of the Domain Name System (“DNS”) and the internet by providing Root Zone Maintainer services, operating two of the thirteen global internet root servers, and providing registration services and authoritative resolution for the .\ncom\n and .\nnet\n top-level domains (“TLDs”), which support the majority of global e-commerce. \nWe were incorporated in Delaware on April 12, 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 12061 Bluemont Way, Reston, Virginia 20190. Our telephone number at that address is (703) 948-3200. Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol VRSN. VERISIGN, the VERISIGN logo, and certain other product or service names are registered or unregistered trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. Other names used in this Form 10-K may be trademarks of their respective owners. Our primary website is \nhttps://www.verisign.com\n. The information available on, or accessible through, this website is not incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference.\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are available, free of charge, on the Investor Relations section of our website as soon as is reasonably practicable after filing such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at \nhttps://www.sec.gov\n.\nPursuant to our agreements with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”), we make available files containing all active domain names registered in the .\ncom \nand .\nnet \nregistries. Further, we also make available a summary of the active zone count registered in the .\ncom\n and \n.net\n registries and the number of \n.com\n and \n.net\n domain name registrations in the domain name base. The zone counts and information on how to obtain access to the zone files can be found at \nhttps://www.verisign.com/zone\n. The domain name base is the active zone plus the number of domain names that are registered but not configured for use in the respective top-level domain zone file plus the number of domain names that are in a client or server hold status. The domain name base may also reflect compensated or uncompensated judicial or administrative actions to keep in or remove from the active zone an immaterial number of domain names. These files and the related summary data are updated at least once per day. The update times may vary each day. The number of domain names provided in this Form 10-K are as of midnight of the date reported. \nWe announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website \nhttps://investor.verisign.com\n, SEC filings, investor events, news and earnings releases, public conference calls and webcasts. We use these channels as well as social media to communicate with our investors and the public about our company, our products and services, and other issues. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the social media channels and websites listed below. This list may be updated from time to time on our investor relations website.\nhttps://verisign.com\nhttps://blog.verisign.com\nhttps://facebook.com/verisign\nhttps://x.com/verisign\nhttps://linkedin.com/company/verisign\nhttps://youTube.com/user/verisign\nhttps://dnib.com\nThe contents of these websites are not intended to be incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file.\nServices \nWe operate the authoritative directory, for all \n.com, .net, \nand\n .name\n domain names (generic top-level domains, “gTLDs”), as well as for certain transliterations of .\ncom\n and .\nnet\n in a number of different native languages and scripts (internationalized generic top-level domains, “IDN gTLDs”). We also operate the authoritative directory for all .\ncc\n domain names (country code top-level domain, or “ccTLD”). We operate the technical or back-end systems for .\nedu\n and certain other gTLDs. As the registry \n3\nTable of Contents\nor service provider for these top-level domains, our services allow individuals and organizations to establish their online identities, while providing the secure, always-on access they need to communicate and transact reliably with online audiences. \n \nWe operate the \n.com, .net,\n and \n.name \ngTLDs and the IDN gTLDs under registry agreements with ICANN and also, with respect to the \n.com\n gTLD, a Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce (“DOC”). We operate the .\ncc\n ccTLD under an agreement with Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Under separate agreements, we provide technical or back-end services for .\nedu\n and for certain other gTLDs.\nWe also perform the Root Zone Maintainer function under an agreement with ICANN for the core of the internet’s DNS and operate two of the thirteen root zone servers that contain authoritative data for the top of the DNS hierarchy.\nOur global constellation of DNS servers provides internet protocol (“IP”) address information in response to queries, enabling the use of browsers, email systems, and other systems on the internet. In addition, we own and maintain our shared registration system that allows registrars to enter new second-level domain names into Verisign-operated central directories and to submit modifications, transfers, re-registrations, and deletions for existing second-level domain names (“Shared Registration System”). \nDomain names in the registries we operate can be registered for between one and 10 years. Unlike other gTLDs, the prices we charge for \n.com\n, \n.net \nand\n .name \ndomain name registrations\n \nare subject to restrictions in our agreements with ICANN and our prices may be increased only according to those restrictions. Retail pricing for these domain name registrations is established by registrars. For \n.com\n domain name registrations, we pay ICANN on a quarterly basis $0.2575 for each annual domain name registration and a fixed fee of $6,250. For \n.name \ndomain name registrations, we pay ICANN on a quarterly basis $0.25 for each annual domain name registration. For \n.net \ndomain name registrations, we remit to ICANN a $0.75 fee per annual domain name registration that is collected from registrars.\nRevenues for \n.cc\n domain names and our IDN gTLDs are based on prices that are not subject to the same pricing restrictions as those for the .\ncom\n, .\nnet\n and .\nname \ngTLDs. The fees for our performance of technical or back-end services for \n.edu\n and certain other gTLDs are based on the terms of our agreements with those respective businesses\n. \n \nOperations Infrastructure \nOur main operations infrastructure consists of secure data centers in Dulles, Virginia; Ashburn, Virginia; and New Castle, Delaware; as well as more than 200 other points of presence around the world. Our domain name servers refer requestors to the associated authoritative name servers for second level domains in the registries we operate or support, thus enabling DNS resolution for \n.com\n and \n.net\n domain names and for domain names in the other registries that we operate, or for which we provide technical or back-end services. Our servers process hundreds of billions of transactions daily. Our operations infrastructure operates continuously, supporting the security, integrity and availability of our services, which are critical for our business and internet users. The performance and availability of our infrastructure are critical for our business. Key features of our operations infrastructure include: \n \n•\nDistributed Servers:  \nWe operate a large number of high-speed servers globally to support localized transaction volume and performance demands. In conjunction with our proprietary software, processes and procedures, this purpose-built global constellation of servers offers rapid failover, global and local load balancing, and threshold monitoring on critical servers. \n \n•\nNetworking:  \nWe deploy and maintain a redundant and diverse global network, maintain high-speed, redundant connections to numerous internet service providers, and maintain network interconnection relationships globally to ensure that our critical services are readily accessible to end users. \n \n•\nSecurity and Availability:  \nWe incorporate architectural concepts such as protected domains, restricted nodes, and distributed access control in our system architecture. In addition, we employ firewalls and intrusion detection software, endpoint and network detection and response systems as well as proprietary security mechanisms at many points across our infrastructure. We perform continuous internal vulnerability testing and periodic controls audits, and also contract with third-party security organizations to perform periodic penetration tests and security risk assessments on our systems. We have engineered resiliency and diversity into how we host classes of products throughout our set of interconnected sites to reduce the risk of unknown vendor defects and zero-day security vulnerabilities. \n•\nData Integrity:  \nWe use several proprietary systemic integrity checks and validations to ensure data correctness when updating and publishing the DNS records for the registries we operate. \n \nWe continuously seek to enhance our infrastructure and capabilities to support both normal and peak system load plus attack volumes based on historical experience, as well as to address projected internet attack trends.\n4\nTable of Contents\n \nCall Centers and Service Desk:  \nWe provide customer support services over the phone, by email and through web-based self-help systems. Our support teams are staffed with trained technical customer support personnel. Support is available for customers 24 hours a day. \n \nOperations Support and Monitoring:  \nThrough our network operations center, we have an extensive monitoring capability that enables us to track the status and performance of our critical systems, network and services. Our network operations center monitors our systems continuously. \n \nDisaster Recovery Plans:  \nWe have disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities that are designed to deal with the loss of entire data centers and other facilities. We maintain data centers with mirrored services that allow failover with no data loss and no loss of function or capacity. Our critical data services (including domain name registration) use advanced storage systems and techniques such as synchronous mirroring and remote replication to our global resolution sites to provide data protection. We periodically operate services at alternate data centers during maintenance windows to ensure the availability of our data centers for disaster recovery.\nMarketing, Sales and Distribution \nWe seek to expand our business through focused marketing campaigns and programs that target growth in \n.com\n,\n .net\n and \n.cc \ndomain names, both domestically and internationally through our registrars. We provide tools to be used by both registrars and end users to enable them to find relevant domain names. We have marketing and sales offices and account management teams in several countries around the world.\nResearch and Development \nWe believe that timely development of new and enhanced capabilities for our DNS registration and resolution infrastructure and of new and enhanced ways to ensure the security, stability, and resiliency of our services, are vital to protect our business in an ever-increasing cyberthreat environment, to adapt to evolving internet protocols and standards, and to remain competitive in the marketplace. We also invest in R&D that benefits the DNS and internet community in which we operate more broadly. \nOur future success will depend, in large part, on our ability to continue to maintain and enhance our current technologies and services and to develop new ones. We actively investigate and incubate new concepts and evaluate new business ideas through our innovation pipeline. We expect that most of the future enhancements to our existing services and our new services will be the result of internal development efforts in collaboration with suppliers, other vendors, customers, and the technology community. Under certain circumstances, we may also acquire or license technology from third parties. \nCompetition\nWe face competition in the domain name registry space from other gTLD and ccTLD registries that are competing for the business of entities and individuals that are seeking to obtain a domain name registration. In addition to the registries we operate or for which we provide technical or back-end services, there are numerous other operational gTLD registries, ASCII ccTLD registries, IDN ccTLD registries, and IDN gTLD registries. Under our agreements with ICANN, we are subject to certain restrictions in the operation of \n.com\n, \n.net\n and \n.name\n on pricing, bundling, marketing, methods of distribution, introduction of new registry services, and use of registrars, that do not apply to ccTLDs and other gTLDs and therefore may create a competitive disadvantage. Among our competitors operating gTLD and ccTLD registries are China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), DENIC eG, Nominet, Identity Digital, Public Interest Registry (PIR),\n \nCentralNic, Google, .xyz, GoDaddy, and Radix.\nDemand for domain names could be negatively impacted to the extent end-users establish their online identities using social media (such as Facebook, Instagram or Tiktok) or transact business on e-commerce platforms (such as Amazon, Etsy and Taobao) instead of registering domain names. Furthermore, demand for domain names could also be negatively impacted by the activities of providers of web and mobile applications that allow end-users to locate and access content.\nAlternative namespaces, new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure. Our industry is characterized by collaborative relationships involving our competitors. In the past, certain of our competitors have consolidated or vertically integrated. Our ability to participate and benefit from such collaborative arrangements or consolidations may be limited and such collaborative arrangements and consolidations could harm our competitive position and adversely impact our business.\n5\nTable of Contents\nIndustry Regulation \nThe DNS is governed under a multi-stakeholder model comprised of civil society, the private sector, including for-profit and not-for-profit organizations such as ICANN, governments, including the U.S. government, academia, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations. ICANN plays a central coordination role in this bottom-up multi-stakeholder system. ICANN is mandated through its bylaws to uphold a private sector-led multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance for the public benefit. ICANN’s multi-stakeholder policy development processes have created, and will continue to create, policies, programs, and standards that directly or indirectly impact our business. Certain policies can be adopted as Consensus or Temporary Policies, which we are obligated to follow under our agreements with ICANN.\nWe are also subject to country-level laws and regulations in the United States and in international locations. In China, we are required to maintain licenses for .\ncom,\n .\nnet, \nand \n.cc\n under regulations issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Additionally, in many jurisdictions in which we operate, including California, the European Union, the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere, strict data security and data privacy regulations have been, or are being, adopted. Because we do not possess extensive personal registrant information, we have not yet experienced significant impacts from these regulations. However, compliance costs and other business impacts could become significant if we begin to receive personal registrant information in our .\ncom\n and .\nnet\n gTLDs. Other regulations, or changes to regulations, including those related to cybersecurity, may also significantly impact our business operations.\n \n.com Generic\n \nTop-Level Domain\nOur operation of the .\ncom\n gTLD is subject to the terms of a registry agreement with ICANN (as amended, the “.\ncom\n Registry Agreement”). The current term of the \n.com\n Registry Agreement is six years and must be renewed or extended by November 30, 2030. Although the \n.com\n Registry Agreement contains a “presumptive” right of renewal, ICANN could terminate or refuse to renew the Registry Agreement in certain prescribed circumstances. See “Risk Factors - Any loss or modification of our right to operate the .\ncom\n and .\nnet\n gTLDs could have a material adverse impact on our business and result in loss of revenues.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information. \nOther significant terms within the .\ncom\n Registry Agreement include performance specifications and service level agreements, including for example, for the availability of our DNS resolution services, our Shared Registration System, and our Registration Data Directory services, which include our Whois and Registration Data Access Protocol services. The .\ncom\n Registry Agreement contains marketing limitations, including limitations on our ability to bundle products and the manner in which we provide marketing support to ICANN-accredited registrars. We are also required under the .\ncom\n Registry Agreement to provide ICANN-accredited registrars with nondiscriminatory access to our systems to register or take other actions related to domain names. In order to introduce new Registry Services or make material changes to existing Registry Services, we must follow prescribed procedures which permit ICANN to review and approve such services. \nThe .\ncom\n Registry Agreement permits an increase to the Maximum Price (as defined in the\n .com\n Registry Agreement) of \n.com\n domain name registrations by up to 7% over the previous year in each of the final four years of each six-year period. The first such six-year period began on October 26, 2018. The restrictions in the \n.com\n Registry Agreement relating to vertical integration apply solely to the \n.com\n gTLD. \nOur operation of the .\ncom\n gTLD is also subject to the terms of a Cooperative Agreement with the DOC. The Cooperative Agreement has undergone various amendments with the most recent, Amendment 35, on October 26, 2018. On November 30, 2024, the Cooperative Agreement was automatically renewed on the same terms for a successive six-year term and will automatically renew on November 30, 2030, unless the DOC provides written notice of non-renewal within 120 days prior to the end of the then-current term. The Cooperative Agreement requires the mutual consent of the DOC and the Company to change its terms. In addition, under Amendment 35, we have agreed to continue to operate the .\ncom\n gTLD in a content-neutral manner and to work within ICANN processes to promote the development of content-neutral policies for the operation of the DNS.\nThe Cooperative Agreement further provides that we shall be entitled at any time during the term of the \n.com\n Registry Agreement to seek to remove the pricing restrictions contained in the \n.com\n Registry Agreement if we demonstrate to the DOC that market conditions no longer warrant pricing restrictions in the \n.com\n Registry Agreement, as determined by the DOC.\nDOC approval of changes to or the renewal of the .\ncom\n Registry Agreement was limited by Amendment 35 to only the following circumstances: (1) changes to the pricing provisions (other than as approved in Amendment 35, which are described above), (2) changes to the vertical integration provisions, (3) changes to the security, stability and resiliency posture as reflected in the functional or performance specifications (including the service level agreements), (4) changes to the conditions for renewal or termination of the \n.com\n Registry Agreement, or (5) changes to the Whois service (except as mandated by ICANN through Temporary or Consensus Policies). As was the case with prior amendments, Amendment 35 is not intended to confer federal antitrust immunity on the Company with respect to the .\ncom\n Registry Agreement.\n6\nTable of Contents\n.net Generic Top-Level Domain\nOur operation of the .\nnet g\nTLD is subject to the terms of a registry agreement with ICANN (as amended, the “\n.net\n Registry Agreement”). The \n.net \nRegistry Agreement was renewed on June 29, 2023. The current term of this agreement is six years and must be renewed or extended by July 1, 2029. The terms of the .\nnet\n Registry Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the .\ncom\n Registry Agreement, except as to ICANN fees as described earlier and that the annual price for new and renewal .\nnet\n domain name registrations may be increased by 10% each year. Our operation of the .\nnet \ngTLD is not subject to the terms of the Cooperative Agreement.\nRoot Operations \nWe operate two of the world’s thirteen root servers. Along with the ICANN community, we are involved in discussions to establish criteria for operations of the root server system including the root servers that we operate. We also publish the root zone file, as the Root Zone Maintainer, under the Root Zone Maintainer Service Agreement (“RZMA”) with ICANN. The RZMA was renewed on October 20, 2024 and the current term of the RZMA ends on October 20, 2032. The RZMA is subject to an automatic eight-year renewal, unless earlier modified or terminated. \nThe descriptions of the \n.com\n Registry Agreement, the Cooperative Agreement, and the \n.net\n Registry Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of the complete agreements that are incorporated by reference as exhibits in this Form 10-K. \nHuman Capital Management\nOur employees are mission driven and values focused. Their dedication to these principles forms the backbone that enables Verisign to provide for the security, stability, and resiliency of the DNS and the internet. We recognize the importance of talent and culture in driving an environment that fosters high performance, inclusion, and integrity in all aspects of our work.\n We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent, and we routinely monitor and present our progress in these areas to executive management and the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2024, we had 932 employees, of which 929 were full-time. 863 employees (representing approximately 93% of our total workforce) were based in the U.S., and 69 employees (representing approximately 7% of our total workforce) were based outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 30% of our global workforce was female, and approximately 45% of our U.S. employees were ethnically and racially diverse. No U.S.-based employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. Based on periodic monitoring, we believe that our employee turnover is relatively low compared to competitive benchmarks and historical trends. We attribute our strong retention rates to our employees’ passion for and focus on the Company’s mission and values, our continual development of talent, and our delivery of competitive and equitable reward programs. We regularly review our workforce policies, procedures, and training programs, as well as our overall workforce demographics, in an effort to create a high performing, ethical, respectful, and collaborative work environment where employees can thrive.\nEmployee Engagement: \nIn order to deliver on our mission, we believe it is important to have a diverse and engaged workforce that exhibits our values, which include: being stewards of the internet, being passionate about technology, respecting others, exhibiting integrity, taking responsibility, and holding ourselves to a higher standard. We strive to create an environment where employees feel a sense of belonging and feel empowered to bring their diverse skills, perspectives, and talents to bear. These principles are integrated into our operating model and are foundational to our ability to attract, retain, and develop top talent and allow us to drive stronger overall performance and decision making. In 2024, we reinforced the importance of creating a respectful and inclusive workplace through training sessions. Additionally, our five employee resource groups serve to educate and further drive connection and a sense of belonging across the workplace. To monitor engagement levels and well-being we routinely conduct employee surveys and review key workforce statistics. In our most recent survey conducted in October 2024, approximately 96% of our employee population participated. The survey results indicated that our employees remain highly engaged, have a strong commitment to our mission and values, and are proud to work at Verisign. These sentiments are reflected in our workforce statistics, including our average employee tenure of approximately 10 years.\nCompensation, Pay Equity, and Employee Benefits:\n To align with our philosophy of providing compelling total rewards, we have practices in place to deliver fair and equitable compensation for employees based on their contribution and performance. We benchmark and regularly review our compensation and benefits against the market to confirm they remain competitive. We offer a broad and comprehensive set of benefits to meet the diverse needs of our workforce. In addition, we regularly perform analyses on base pay, annual incentives, and long-term incentives to help calibrate compensation and ensure pay equity.\nTalent Development and Acquisition:\n We are committed to the continued development of our people. Strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur on a regular basis. We believe that employee development is anchored in acquiring skills and work experiences that meet the needs of the business and the individual. We focus on leadership capability development and provide  opportunities that enhance technical and soft skills to equip our workforce for current and future growth. Our learning opportunities are a blend of on-the-job experiences and instructor-led and on-demand learning sessions that meet the unique \n7\nTable of Contents\ndevelopment needs of our workforce. Additionally, all employees are required to complete annual ethics and compliance and monthly data security trainings. Our managers regularly hold conversations with employees about career management, coaching, and other development opportunities to help encourage and drive the growth of our talent.\n \nWe are focused on the competitive labor market, and we work diligently to ensure comprehensive sourcing strategies are in place which enable the attraction of the best talent. \nEmployee Health, Safety and Well-being:\n We are committed to maintaining a safe and healthy environment for our employees. We have a robust physical safety and security program, including a life safety program which trains employees on appropriate emergency responses. We also offer a holistic wellness experience for our employees through our Mindful Connections program that supports employees across three pillars: physical, emotional, and financial. We support a hybrid work posture where our employees operate under team agreements that set the foundation for operating norms and allow employees to create work schedules that align with corporate and individual needs. This provides employees more flexibility to manage a healthy work-life balance. Our offices remain key to enabling collaboration, networking, and strategic discussion.\nThe following table shows a comparison of our consolidated employee headcount, by function: \nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEmployee headcount by function:\nCost of revenues\n256 \n247 \n242 \nResearch and development\n246 \n244 \n255 \nSelling, general and administrative\n430 \n417 \n420 \nTotal\n932 \n908 \n917 \nIntellectual Property \nWe rely on a combination of copyrighted software, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, know-how, restrictions on disclosure, and other methods to protect our proprietary assets. We also enter into confidentiality and/or intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, customers and business partners. We also control access to and distribution of proprietary documentation and other confidential information.\nWe have been issued numerous patents in the U.S. and abroad, covering a wide range of our technologies. Additionally, we continue to file patent applications with respect to certain of our technologies in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and internationally. Patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded, they may not provide sufficient protection of our technologies. We continue to consider opportunities for strategic growth and use of our patent portfolio.\nWe have obtained trademark registrations for the VERISIGN mark and VERISIGN logo in the U.S. and certain countries, and have pending trademark applications for the VERISIGN logo in a number of other countries. We have common law rights in other proprietary names. We take steps to enforce and monitor potential infringement of Verisign’s trademarks. We rely on the strength of our Verisign brand to help differentiate ourselves in the marketing of our products and services.\nOur principal intellectual property consists of, and our success is dependent upon, proprietary software used in our business and certain methodologies (many of which are patented or for which patent applications are pending) and technical expertise and proprietary know-how we use in both the design and implementation of our current and future registry services. We own our proprietary Shared Registration System through which registrars submit second-level domain name registrations for each of the registries we operate, as well as the ATLAS distributed lookup system which processes hundreds of billions of queries per day. Some of the software and protocols used in our business are in the public domain or are otherwise available to our competitors, and some are based on open standards set by organizations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force. To the extent any of our patents are considered “standard essential patents,” we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents.\n \n8\nTable of Contents\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our executive officers as of February 13, 2025:\nName\nAge\nPosition\nD.

You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nOverview\nWe are a global provider of critical internet infrastructure and domain name registry services, enabling internet navigation for many of the world’s most recognized domain names. We help enable the security, stability, and resiliency of the DNS and the internet by providing Root Zone Maintainer Services, operating two of the thirteen global internet root servers, and providing registration services and authoritative resolution for the .\ncom\n and .\nnet\n TLDs, which support the majority of global e-commerce. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 169.0 million .\ncom\n and .\nnet\n registrations in the domain name base. The number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising, e-commerce, and the number of internet users, which is partially driven by greater availability of internet access, as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars. The number of domain name registrations under our management may be negatively impacted by certain factors, including overall economic conditions, competition from ccTLDs, other gTLDs, services that offer alternatives for an online presence, such as social media, and ongoing changes in the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses. Factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users, and how they navigate the internet, as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names, can negatively impact our business and the demand for new domain name registrations and renewals.\n2024 Business Highlights and Trends\n•\nWe recorded revenues of $1,557.4 million in 2024, which represents an increase of 4% as compared to 2023.\n•\nWe recorded operating income of $1,058.2 million during 2024, which represents an increase of 6% as compared to 2023. \n•\nWe finished 2024 with 169.0 million \n.com \nand \n.net\n registrations in the domain name base, which represents a 2.1% decrease from December 31, 2023.\n•\nDuring 2024, we processed 37.4 million new domain name registrations for .\ncom\n and .\nnet\n compared to 39.4 million in 2023.\n•\nThe final \n.com\n and \n.net \nrenewal rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 72.2% compared to 73.5% for the same quarter of 2023. Renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter.\n•\nWe repurchased 6.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $1.21 billion in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, there was $1.02 billion remaining for future share repurchases under the share repurchase program.\n•\nWe generated cash flows from operating activities of $902.6 million in 2024, which represents an increase of 6% as compared to 2023.\n•\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased the annual registry-level wholesale fee for each new and renewal .\ncom\n domain name registration from $9.59 to $10.26. \n24\nTable of Contents\n•\nOn November 25, 2024, we renewed the .\ncom\n Registry Agreement with ICANN, pursuant to which we will remain the sole registry operator for the .\ncom\n registry through November 30, 2030. Pursuant to the renewed .\ncom\n Registry Agreement, we cannot increase the price of a .\ncom\n domain name registration during the first two years of the six year contract term.\nCritical Accounting Estimates \nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n \nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. We believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements: \n \nIncome taxes\nWe operate in multiple tax jurisdictions in the United States and internationally. Tax laws and regulations in these jurisdictions are complex, interrelated, and periodically changing. Significant judgment or interpretation of these laws and regulations is often required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, including, for example, the calculations of taxable income in each jurisdiction, deferred taxes, and the availability and amount of deductions and tax credits. We have recognized $281.3 million of deferred tax assets, net as of December 31, 2024. Our income tax expense was $236.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The final taxes payable are also dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from various tax examinations. See Note 11, “Income Taxes” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues:\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenues\n12.3 \n13.2 \n14.1 \nResearch and development\n6.2 \n6.1 \n6.0 \nSelling, general and administrative\n13.6 \n13.7 \n13.7 \nTotal costs and expenses\n32.1 \n33.0 \n33.8 \nOperating income\n67.9 \n67.0 \n66.2 \nInterest expense\n(4.8)\n(5.0)\n(5.3)\nNon-operating income, net\n2.5 \n3.4 \n0.9 \nIncome before income taxes\n65.6 \n65.4 \n61.8 \nIncome tax expense\n(15.2)\n(10.6)\n(14.5)\nNet income\n50.4 \n%\n54.8 \n%\n47.3 \n%\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the\n .com\n and \n.net\n domain name registries. We also derive revenues from operating domain name registries and technical systems for several other gTLDs and one ccTLD, all of which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues. For domain names registered in the \n.com\n and \n.net\n registries, we receive a fee from registrars per annual registration that is determined pursuant to our agreements with ICANN. Individual customers, called registrants, contract directly with registrars or their resellers, and the registrars, who are our direct customers, in turn register the domain names with Verisign. Changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases, to the \n25\nTable of Contents\nextent permitted by ICANN and the DOC. New registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising, e-commerce, and the number of internet users, as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars. We also offer promotional incentive-based discount programs to registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate.\nIn November 2024, we renewed the .\ncom\n Registry Agreement with ICANN, pursuant to which we will remain the sole registry operator for the .\ncom\n registry through November 30, 2030. Under the .\ncom\n Registry Agreement, we are permitted to increase the price of a \n.com\n domain name registration by up to 7% in each of the final four years of each six-year period. The first such six-year period began on October 26, 2018. We increased the annual registry-level wholesale fee for each new and renewal .\ncom\n domain name registration from $8.97 to $9.59 effective September 1, 2023, and from $9.59 to $10.26 effective September 1, 2024. Under the \n.net\n Registry Agreement, which renewed in June 2023, we are permitted to increase the price of \n.net\n domain name registrations by up to 10% each year during the term of our agreement with ICANN, through June 30, 2029. We increased the annual registry-level wholesale fee for each new and renewal \n.net\n domain name registration from $9.02 to $9.92 effective February 1, 2023, and from $9.92 to $10.91 effective February 1, 2024. All fees paid to us for \n.com\n and \n.net\n registrations are in U.S. dollars.\nA comparison of revenues is presented below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n%\nChange\n2023\n%\nChange\n2022\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nRevenues\n$\n1,557.4 \n4 \n%\n$\n1,493.1 \n5 \n%\n$\n1,424.9 \nThe following table compares the .\ncom\n and \n.net\n domain name registrations in the domain name base:\n \nAs of December 31,\n2024\n%\nChange\n2023\n%\nChange\n2022\n.com\n and \n.net\n domain name registrations in the domain name base\n169.0 million\n(2)\n%\n172.7 million\n(1)\n%\n173.8 million\nRevenues increased in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the .\ncom\n and .\nnet\n price increases, partially offset by a decline in the .\ncom\n and .\nnet\n domain name base, and the elimination of revenue from the operation of the .\ngov\n gTLD, which was transitioned to another service provider in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nDemand for \n.com\n and\n .net\n domain names has been primarily driven by continued internet growth and marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars. However, competitive pressure from ccTLDs, other gTLDs, services that offer alternatives for an online presence, such as social media, ongoing changes in internet practices and behaviors of consumers and business, as well as the motivation of existing domain name registrants managing their investment in domain names, such as for resale at increased prices or for revenue generation through website advertising, and global economic conditions, has limited the demand for \n.com\n and\n .net\n domain names and may continue to do so in the future. While the core value proposition of a domain name remains strong, challenging economic and regulatory conditions have continued to weaken demand for \n.com\n and\n .net \ndomain name registrations in China, and some registrars, particularly in the U.S., have shifted their focus to increasing profitability through higher retail pricing and a decrease in marketing activities targeting new customer acquisition. The combination of these factors has negatively impacted our renewal rates and the volume of new \n.com\n and \n.net\n domain name registrations, resulting in a decline in our domain name base.\n26\nTable of Contents\nGeographic revenues\nWe generate revenues in the U.S.; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); Australia, China, Japan, Singapore, and other Asia Pacific countries (“APAC”); and certain other countries, including Canada and Latin American countries. \nThe following table presents a comparison of the Company’s geographic revenues: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n%\nChange\n2023\n%\nChange\n2022\n(Dollars in millions)\nU.S\n$\n1,035.5 \n4 \n%\n$\n994.7 \n6 \n%\n$\n937.6 \nEMEA\n249.6 \n9 \n%\n228.2 \n1 \n%\n226.0 \nAPAC\n175.7 \n1 \n%\n174.8 \n4 \n%\n167.7 \nOther\n96.6 \n1 \n%\n95.4 \n2 \n%\n93.6 \nTotal revenues\n$\n1,557.4 \n4 \n%\n$\n1,493.1 \n5 \n%\n$\n1,424.9 \nRevenues in the table above are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located; however, this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located. Revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating, relocating, or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers. Revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region, registering domain names in another region. The majority of our revenue growth was generated from registrars based in the U.S. and EMEA, while revenue growth in APAC was limited during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of a 13% decline in revenues from China due to the lower demand noted above.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel who manage the operational systems, depreciation expenses, operational costs associated with the delivery of our services, fees paid to ICANN, customer support and training, costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities, telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead.\nA comparison of cost of revenues is presented below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n%\nChange\n2023\n%\nChange\n2022\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nCost of revenues\n$\n191.4 \n(3)\n%\n$\n197.3 \n(2)\n%\n$\n200.7 \nCost of revenues decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to decreases in depreciation expenses and telecommunication expenses, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits expenses and a combination of other individually insignificant factors. Depreciation expenses decreased by $7.4 million due to a decrease in capital expenditures in recent periods. Telecommunication expenses decreased by $3.9 million primarily due to savings on renewals of colocation agreements. Compensation and benefits expenses increased by $2.6 million primarily due to annual salary increases.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel, including salaries and other personnel-related expenses, consulting fees, facilities costs, computer and communications equipment, support services used in our service and technology development, and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead.\nA comparison of research and development expenses is presented below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n%\nChange\n2023\n%\nChange\n2022\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nResearch and development\n$\n96.7 \n6 \n%\n$\n91.0 \n6 \n%\n$\n85.7 \n27\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expenses increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefit expenses and a combination of several other individually insignificant factors. Compensation and benefits expenses increased by $3.0 million primarily due to annual salary increases.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses for our executive, administrative, legal, finance, information technology, human resources, sales, and marketing personnel, travel and related expenses, trade shows, costs of computer and communications equipment and support services, consulting and professional service fees, costs of marketing programs, costs of facilities, management information systems, support services, and certain tax and license fees, offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types.\nA comparison of selling, general and administrative expenses is presented below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n%\nChange\n2023\n%\nChange\n2022\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nSelling, general and administrative\n$\n211.1 \n3 \n%\n$\n204.2 \n4 \n%\n$\n195.4 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expenses, equipment and software expenses and professional services expenses, partially offset by an increase in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types. Compensation and benefits expenses increased by $4.4 million primarily due to annual salary increases. Equipment and software expenses increased by $3.6 million primarily due to increases in expenses related to network security and other software services. Professional services expenses increased by $2.9 million primarily due to an increase in external consulting costs related to various projects. Overhead expenses allocated to other cost types increased by $3.1 million due to an increase in total allocable expenses.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense remained consistent during 2024 compared to 2023. \nNon-operating income, net\nSee Note 10, “Non-operating Income, Net” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \nIncome tax expense\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(Dollars in millions)\nIncome tax expense\n$\n236.2 \n$\n158.9 \n$\n206.4 \nEffective tax rate\n23 \n%\n16 \n%\n23 \n%\nThe effective tax rate for each of the periods in the table above differed from the statutory federal rate of 21%, due to state income taxes and U.S. taxes on foreign earnings, net of foreign tax credits, offset by a lower foreign effective tax rate. \nDuring 2023, we recognized $69.3 million of income tax benefits related to a step-up in tax basis of certain non-U.S. intellectual property, recognition of previously unrecognized income tax benefits as the related statutes of limitations lapsed, and a beneficial change in certain state income apportionment rules. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $282.2 million, net of valuation allowances, but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities. With the exception of a portion of deferred tax assets related to intellectual property, certain state and foreign net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, together with future taxable income, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets.\nThe income tax expense for 2024 includes the impact of the OECD Pillar 2 minimum tax adopted by applicable tax jurisdictions. While our foreign income taxes increased as a result of the Pillar 2 minimum tax, the overall impact was not material as the additional taxes in these jurisdictions were partly offset by related foreign tax credits in the U.S.\n28\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents our principal sources of liquidity:\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n \n(In millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n206.7 \n$\n240.1 \nMarketable securities\n393.2 \n686.3 \nTotal\n$\n599.9 \n$\n926.4 \n The marketable securities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy, which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities. The cash equivalents consist of amounts invested in money market funds, time deposits and U.S. Treasury bills purchased with original maturities of three months or less. As of December 31, 2024, all of our debt securities have contractual maturities of less than one year. Our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible. For additional information on our investment portfolio, see Note 2, “Financial Instruments,” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nEffective July 25, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of $1.11 billion, in addition to the $388.0 million that remained available for repurchases under the share repurchase program, for a total repurchase authorization of up to $1.50 billion under the program. In 2024, we repurchased 6.6 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $183.84 for an aggregate cost of $1.21 billion under our share repurchase program. In 2023, we repurchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $210.28 for an aggregate cost of $882.8 million. As of December 31, 2024, there was approximately $1.02 billion remaining available for future share repurchases under the share repurchase program.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $750.0 million principal amount outstanding of 2.70% senior unsecured notes due 2031, $550.0 million principal amount outstanding of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2027, and $500.0 million principal amount outstanding of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due April 2025 (“2025 Senior Notes”). Under existing market conditions, we intend to refinance all of our 2025 Senior Notes through the issuance of new long-term debt. As of December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings and $200.0 million in borrowing capacity under our credit facility which matures in 2028. If a suitable refinancing arrangement is not available due to a change in market conditions, we intend to utilize the credit facility to repay $200.0 million of the 2025 Senior Notes.\nWe believe existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and funds generated from operations, together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure requirements, and to service our debt for the next 12 months and beyond. We regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs. Our most significant future cash requirements include interest and principal payments on the senior notes issuances described above, income tax payments, purchase obligations and registry fees related to the operation of certain top-level domains. These items are detailed in Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIn summary, our cash flows were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n902.6 \n$\n853.8 \n$\n831.1 \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n286.3 \n(97.4)\n355.7 \nNet cash used in financing activities\n(1,221.5)\n(889.8)\n(1,035.8)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(0.8)\n(0.1)\n(0.8)\nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(33.4)\n$\n(133.5)\n$\n150.2 \nCash flows from operating activities \n \nOur largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures and other general operating expenses, as well as payments related to taxes, interest and facilities.\n29\nTable of Contents\n \nNet cash provided by operating activities increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes, partially offset by an increase in cash paid to employees and vendors. Cash received from customers increased primarily due to the impact of the .\ncom\n and the \n.net\n price increases. Cash paid for income taxes decreased primarily due to comparatively lower federal and foreign income tax payments, partially offset by higher state income tax payments and a higher installment payment for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Cash paid to employees and vendors increased primarily due to increases in operating expenses and the timing of payments. \nCash flows from investing activities \n \nThe changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases, maturities and sales of marketable securities, and purchases of property and equipment.\nWe had net cash inflows from investing activities in 2024, compared to net cash outflows from investing activities in 2023, primarily due to an increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, net of purchases of marketable securities, and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment, primarily related to the purchase of a building in 2023.\nCash flows from financing activities \n \nThe changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases, proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan and payment of excise tax on share repurchases.\n \nNet cash used in financing activities increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and payment of excise tax on share repurchases in 2024.\nDilution from RSUs \nGrants of stock-based awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that these stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages. As of December 31, 2024, there were a total of 0.7 million unvested RSUs which represent potential dilution of less than 1.0%. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding RSUs vest and are settled. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of RSU grants to employees; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future if and as we use our available cash for other purposes.",
