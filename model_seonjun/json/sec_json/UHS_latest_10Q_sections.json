Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors \nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and in \nPart II, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part I, Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors, \nas\n \nincluded herein. Those factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any of our forward-looking statements.\n \nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control.  Many factors, including those set forth herein in \nItem 1A. Risk Factors \nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024,\n \nand other important factors disclosed in this Quarterly Report, and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:\n•\nas discussed below in \nSources of Revenue, \nwe receive revenues from various state and county-based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate. We receive annual Medicaid revenues of approximately $100 million, or greater, from each of Texas, California, Nevada, Washington, D.C., Illinois, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Florida, Mississippi and Washington. Most of these programs are approved on a year-to-year basis and there is no assurance that these revenues will continue at their current rates or at all. We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state-based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states; \n•\nlegislation adopted on July 4, 2025 (the One Big Beautiful Bill Act), attaches work and community service requirements to eligibility for Medicaid benefits that will have the effect of limiting Medicaid enrollment and expenditure. That legislation also places limits on provider fees used to increase federal Medicaid funding to states. The legislation prohibits states not previously having expanded Medicaid eligibility to 138% of federal poverty level from increasing the rate of current provider fees which fund certain state supplemental payments or increasing the base of the fee to a class or items of services that the fee did not previously cover. That current provider fee threshold will remain at 6%.  For states having expanded Medicaid eligibility under the legislation, the provider fee threshold will be reduced by 0.5% annually between federal fiscal years 2028 and 2032 with the resulting threshold ultimately becoming 3.5%. The legislation also eliminates certain insurance exchange premium tax credits beyond 2025 and exchange enrollment is expected to be adversely impacted. Extension of the tax credits is currently the subject of United States Congressional debate as part of the federal budget negotiation, and we cannot predict whether these subsidies will ultimately be adopted in federal fiscal year 2026. All of these factors, which could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, may be expected to reduce our revenue and likely increase the level of uncompensated care provided by our facilities;  \n•\nthere are additional legislative changes that are likely to result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level. For example, Congress has reduced to $0 the penalty for failing to maintain health coverage that was part of the original Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA\") as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Biden administration had issued executive orders implementing a special enrollment period permitting individuals to enroll in health plans outside of the annual open enrollment period and reexamining policies that may undermine the ACA or the Medicaid program. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was passed on August 16, 2022, which among other things, allows for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") to negotiate prices for certain single-source drugs reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. The American Rescue Plan Act’s expansion of subsidies to purchase coverage through an ACA exchange, which the IRA continued through 2025, has increased exchange enrollment.  However, the Trump administration has already taken steps to undo these Biden-era initiatives, including adopting legislation eliminating certain exchange premium tax credits; \n•\nthere have been numerous political and legal efforts to expand, repeal, replace or modify the ACA since its enactment, some of which have been successful, in part, in modifying the ACA, as well as court challenges to the constitutionality of the legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court held in \nCalifornia v. Texas\n that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the legislation’s requirement to obtain minimum essential health insurance coverage, or the individual mandate.  The Court dismissed the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. The legislation faced its most recent challenge when the Supreme Court, in the June 2025 \nKennedy v.\n \nBraidwood Management \ndecision, opined in favor of ACA HIV preventive care coverage. The impacts of this decision cannot be predicted. Any future efforts to challenge, replace or replace the ACA or expand or substantially amend its provision is unknown.  See below in \nSources of Revenues and Health Care Reform \nfor additional disclosure;\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nadditional possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payers or government based payers, including Medicare or Medicaid in the United States, and government based payers in the United Kingdom;\n•\nthe healthcare industry is labor intensive and salaries, wages and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supplies expense and other operating expenses. In the past, staffing shortages have, at times, required us to hire expensive temporary personnel and/or enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel. At certain facilities, particularly within our behavioral health care segment, there have been occasions when we were unable to fill all vacant positions and, consequently, we were required to limit patient volumes. We have also experienced general inflationary cost increases related to certain of our other operating expenses. Many of these factors, which had a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations in prior years, have moderated more recently. However, we cannot predict future inflationary increases, which if significant, could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations.  We have experienced inflationary pressures, primarily in personnel costs, although those pressures have moderated more recently. The extent of any future impacts from inflation on our business and our results of operations will be dependent upon how long the elevated inflation levels persist and the extent to which the rate of inflation further increases, if at all, neither of which we are able to predict. If elevated levels of inflation were to persist or if the rate of inflation were to accelerate, our expenses could increase faster than anticipated and we may utilize our capital resources sooner than expected. Further, given the complexities of the reimbursement landscape in which we operate, our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws, which in certain circumstances, limit our ability to increase prices;\n•\nin our acute care segment, we have experienced a significant increase in hospital based physician related expenses, especially in the areas of emergency room care, anesthesiology and radiology. We have implemented various initiatives to mitigate the increased expense, to the degree possible, which has moderated the rate of increase.  However, significant increases in these physician related expenses could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations;\n•\nthe increase in interest rates during the past few years has increased our interest expense significantly increasing our expenses and reducing our free cash flow and our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms. As such, the effects of increased borrowing rates have adversely impacted our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict future changes to interest rates, however, significant increases in our borrowing rates could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations;\n•\nsignificant tariffs or other restrictions, if imposed on our imported pharmaceutical ingredients, medical devices, medical equipment and their ingredients and components, could escalate costs of medications, medical devices and medical equipment and disrupt our supply chains. While we continue to evaluate the potential impact of the new tariffs on our business, given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of any new tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the U.S. and the impacted foreign countries, we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful. Therefore, changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular, increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from where our products or materials are made (either directly or through our suppliers) could have an impact on our competitive position, business operations and financial results;       \n•\nthe Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025 extended appropriations to federal agencies for continuing projects and activities through September 30, 2025. In the past several years political disputes concerning authorization of a federal budget have led to shutdown of substantial portions of the federal government and other federal budget authorization delays have occurred. Currently, the United States Congress has failed to approve a federal budget for federal fiscal year 2026 and a federal shutdown began on October 1, 2025. Federal budget delays and federal government shutdowns are unpredictable and may occur in the future. We cannot predict whether or not there will be future legislation halting a federal government shutdown, however, our operating cash flows and results of operations could be materially unfavorably impacted by the federal government shutdown;\n•\nas part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the \"CAA\"), Congress passed legislation aimed at preventing or limiting patient balance billing in certain circumstances. The CAA addresses surprise medical bills stemming from emergency services, out-of-network ancillary providers at in-network facilities, and air ambulance carriers. The CAA prohibits surprise billing when out-of-network emergency services or out-of-network services at an in-network facility are provided, unless informed consent is received.  In these circumstances providers are prohibited from billing the patient for any amounts that exceed in-network cost-sharing requirements. HHS, the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury have issued rules to implement the legislation. The rules have limited the ability of our hospital-based physicians to receive payments for services at usually higher out-of-network rates in certain circumstances, and, as a result, have caused us to increase subsidies to these physicians or to replace their services at a higher cost level;\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nin June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo \nand \nRelentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce\n, which modified the regulatory interpretation standard established 40 years ago by \nChevron v. National Resources Defense Council\n. \nChevron\n doctrine generally required courts to defer to federal agencies in their interpretation of federal statutes when a statute was silent or ambiguous with respect to a specific issue.  In \nLoper Bright\n, the Supreme Court held that courts are no longer required to grant such deference, though they may consider an agency’s statutory interpretation. As it is highly regulated, the health care industry could be significantly impacted by the \nLoper Bright\n decision, particularly in the areas of Medicare reimbursement, decision making by the Food & Drug Administration and health care fraud and abuse compliance, where parties may no longer be able to rely on federal agencies’ policies, rules and guidance;\n•\nour ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same; \n•\nthe impact of a shift of care from inpatient to lower cost outpatient settings and controls designed to reduce inpatient services;\n•\nthe outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, inquiries, false claims act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters, and the effects of adverse publicity relating to such matters, as disclosed in\n Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies, \nincluding, but not limited to, the jury verdict returned against Cumberland Hospital for Children and Adolescents located in New Kent, Virginia, an indirect subsidiary of ours, and the verdict in the Pinnacle litigation in Washoe County, Nevada, against certain subsidiaries of ours;   \n•\neffective March, 2025, our excess commercial insurance coverage for professional and general liability claims contains less favorable terms than previous years including coverage exclusions for incidents involving sexual molestation or abuse, higher premiums and lower aggregate limitations; \n•\ncompetition from other healthcare providers (including physician owned facilities) in certain markets;\n•\ntechnological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;\n•\nour ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor and related expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals;\n•\ndemographic changes;\n•\nthere is a heightened risk of future cybersecurity threats, including ransomware attacks targeting healthcare providers. If successful, future cyberattacks could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any costs that we incur as a result of a data security incident or breach, including costs to update our security protocols to mitigate such an incident or breach could be significant. Any breach or failure in our operational security systems, or any third-party security systems that we rely on, can result in loss of data or an unauthorized disclosure of or access to sensitive or confidential member or protected personal or health information and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, significant penalties or fines, litigation, loss of customers, significant damage to our reputation and business, and other liability or losses. We may also incur additional costs related to cybersecurity risk management and remediation. There can be no assurance that we or our service providers, if applicable, will not suffer losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all the costs resulting from such events;\n•\nthe availability of suitable acquisition and divestiture opportunities and our ability to successfully integrate and improve our acquisitions since failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits from certain of our prior or future acquisitions could result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangibles;\n•\nthe impact of severe weather conditions, including the effects of hurricanes, flash floods, wildfires and climate change;\n•\nour ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;\n•\nour inpatient acute care and behavioral health care facilities may experience decreasing admission and length of stay trends;\n•\nour financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payers and there can be no assurance that failure of the payers to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nthe Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the “Joint Committee”), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. Current legislation has extended these reductions through 2032.  We cannot predict whether Congress will restructure the implemented Medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress going forward;\n•\nuninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities unfavorably impact our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;\n•\nchanges in our business strategies or development plans;\n•\nwe have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the pound sterling. We have international subsidiaries that operate in the United Kingdom.  We routinely hedge our exposures to foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations, but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations. To the extent that these hedges are inadequate, our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses, and;\n•\nother factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nGiven these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Our actual results and financial condition could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. We assume no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies or estimates from those disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \nRecent Accounting Standards:\n For a summary of accounting standards, please see \nNote 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n, as included herein.\nResults of Operations\nClinical Staffing, Inflation, future Medicaid reductions and Tariffs:\n \nThe healthcare industry is labor intensive and salaries, wages and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supplies expense and other operating expenses.

In addition, insurance exchange subsidies are scheduled to expire later this year which could unfavorably impact insurance exchange enrollment. Extension of these subsidies is currently the subject of Congressional debate as part of the federal budget negotiation, and we cannot predict whether these subsidies will ultimately be adopted in federal fiscal year 2026. As these provisions become effective over the next several years, they may be expected to reduce our revenues and likely increase the level of uncompensated care provided by our facilities. Please see \nSources of Revenue \nbelow\n \nfor additional disclosure related to Medicaid supplemental payment programs in various states in which we operate.\n \nSignificant tariffs or other restrictions, if imposed on our imported pharmaceutical ingredients, medical devices, medical equipment and their ingredients and components, could escalate costs of medications, medical devices and medical equipment and disrupt our supply chains. While we continue to evaluate the potential impact of the new tariffs on our business, given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of any new tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the U.S. and the impacted foreign countries, we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful. Therefore, changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular, increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from where our products or materials are made (either directly or through our suppliers) could have an impact on our competitive position, business operations and financial results.\n \nAlthough our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited, as discussed above, we have been requesting and negotiating increased rates from commercial insurers to defray our increased cost of providing patient care. In addition, we have implemented various productivity enhancement programs and cost reduction initiatives including, but not limited to, the following: team-based patient care initiatives designed to optimize the level of patient care services provided by our licensed nurses/clinicians; efforts to reduce utilization of, and rates paid for, premium pay labor; consolidation of medical supply vendors to increase purchasing discounts; review and reduction of clinical variation in connection with the utilization of medical supplies, and; various other efforts to increase productivity and/or reduce costs including investments in new information technology applications.\nFinancial results for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and is used in the discussion below for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% of Net\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% of Net\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,495,245\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,963,027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating charges:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,071,898\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,912,308\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n48.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther operating expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,294,721\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,090,197\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplies expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n414,583\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n390,250\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n155,060\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n149,567\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLease and rental expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37,295\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n36,540\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtotal-operating expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,973,557\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n88.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,578,862\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n90.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome from operations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n521,688\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n384,165\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n38,431\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44,660\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther (income) expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(13,629\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.3\n\n\n)%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2,028\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.1\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n496,886\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n341,533\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n117,781\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n75,623\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n379,105\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n265,910\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,148\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,196\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to UHS\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n372,957\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n258,714\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues increased by 13.4%, or $532 million, to $4.495 billion during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $3.963 billion during the third quarter of 2024. The net increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $431 million, or 11.3%, increase in net revenues generated from our acute care hospital services and behavioral health services operated during both periods (which we refer to as “Same Facility”), and; (ii) an other combined net increase of $101 million, consisting primarily of $58 million of combined net revenues generated during the third quarter of 2025 at two newly constructed acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada (West Henderson Hospital which opened during the fourth quarter of 2024), and Washington, D.C.

The net increase was due to:\n•\nan increase of $99 million at our acute care facilities, as discussed below in \nAcute Care Hospital Services\n;\n•\nan increase of $28 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in \nBehavioral Health Care Services\n;\n•\nan increase of $10 million from an increase in the market value of certain equity securities;\n•\nan increase of $6 million from a decrease in interest expense, as discussed below in \nOther Operating Results-Interest Expense\n, and\n;\n•\na $12 million other combined net increase.\nNet income attributable to UHS increased by $114 million, or 44%, to $373 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $259 million during the third quarter of 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to:\n•\na $155 million increase in income before income taxes, as discussed above;\n•\na decrease of $42 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from: (i) the increase in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $155 million increase in income before income taxes, and; (ii) a $3 million increase in the provision for income taxes due to a decrease in the net benefit recorded in connection with \"ASU 2016-09\", Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, net of the impact of executive compensation limitations pursuant to IRC section 162(m) ($0.6 million net benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to $3.9 million during the third quarter of 2024).\nFinancial results for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and is used in the discussion below for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% of Net\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% of Net\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12,878,781\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n11,714,213\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating charges:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,037,953\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,611,304\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n47.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther operating expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,563,039\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,165,483\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplies expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,236,249\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,181,886\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n455,409\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n438,050\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLease and rental expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n109,348\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n108,165\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtotal-operating expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,401,998\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n88.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,504,888\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n89.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome from operations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,476,783\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,209,325\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n113,851\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n146,385\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther (income) expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(27,767\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.2\n\n\n)%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,315\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,390,699\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,059,625\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n327,354\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n233,563\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,063,345\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n826,062\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20,490\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16,362\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to UHS\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,042,855\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n809,700\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues increased by 9.9%, or $1.165 billion, to $12.879 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $11.714 billion during the first nine months of 2024. The net increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $974 million, or 8.6%, increase in net revenues generated from our acute care hospital services and behavioral health services, on a Same Facility basis, and; (ii) an other combined net increase of $191 million consisting primarily of $128 million of combined net revenues generated during the first nine months of 2025 at two newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals, as mentioned above.\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome before income taxes (before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased by $331 million, or 31%, to $1.391 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $1.060 billion during the first nine months of 2024. The net increase was due to:\n•\nan increase of $169 million at our acute care facilities, as discussed below in \nAcute Care Hospital Services\n;\n•\nan increase of $82 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in \nBehavioral Health Care Services\n;\n•\nan increase of $33 million from a decrease in interest expense, as discussed below in \nOther Operating Results-Interest Expense\n;\n•\nan increase of $20 million from an increase in the market value of certain equity securities, and; \n•\n$27 million of other combined net increases.\nNet income attributable to UHS increased by $233 million, or 29%, to $1.043 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $810 million during the first nine months of 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to:\n•\na $331 million increase in income before income taxes, as discussed above;\n•\na decrease of $94 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from: (i) the increase in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $331 million increase in income before income taxes, and; (ii) a $14 million increase in the provision for income taxes due to a decrease in the net benefit recorded in connection with ASU 2016-09 ($1.9 million net benefit recorded during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to $15.5 million during the first nine months of 2024).\nAdjustments to self-insured professional and general liability reserves:\nOur estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.\n \nAs a result of unfavorable trends experienced, included in our results of operations were increases to our reserves for self-insured professional and general liability claims amounting to $35 million during each of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025, and $30 million and $44 million during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Approximately $22 million of the increase is included in our same facility basis acute care hospital services' results during each of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025, respectively, and approximately $13 million is included in our same facility basis behavioral health services' results during each of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025, respectively. Approximately $23 million and $33 million of the increase is included in our same facility basis acute care hospital services' results during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and approximately $7 million and $11 million is included in our same facility basis behavioral health services' results during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n \nAcute Care Hospital Services\nThe following table sets forth certain operating statistics for our acute care hospital services for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSame Facility Basis\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAll\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSame Facility Basis\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAll\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage licensed beds\n\n\n \n\n\n6,869\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,797\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,161\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,797\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,798\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,735\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,043\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,735\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage available beds\n\n\n \n\n\n6,697\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,625\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,989\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,625\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,626\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,563\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,871\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,563\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient days\n\n\n \n\n\n401,148\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n401,479\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n412,353\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n401,479\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,216,788\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,212,669\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,243,297\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,212,669\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage daily census\n\n\n \n\n\n4,360.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,363.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,482.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,363.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,457.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,425.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,554.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,425.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy-licensed beds\n\n\n \n\n\n63.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n62.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n65.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n65.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n65.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy-available beds\n\n\n \n\n\n65.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n65.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n65.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n66.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmissions\n\n\n \n\n\n84,368\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n83,149\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n86,984\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n83,149\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n254,141\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n249,474\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n260,459\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n249,474\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLength of stay\n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAcute Care Hospital Services-Same Facility Basis\nWe believe that providing our results on a “Same Facility” basis (which is a non-GAAP measure), which includes the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance. Our Same Facility results also neutralize (if applicable) the effect of items that are non-operational in nature\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nincluding items such as, but not limited to, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived and intangible assets and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.\nOur Same Facility basis results reflected on the table below also exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below \nSources of Revenue-Summary of Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs.\n However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under \nAll Acute Care Hospital Services\n. The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses. Prior year amounts related to certain facilities previously included in our Behavioral Health Care Services’ results have been reclassified into our Acute Care Hospital Services' results as of May 1, 2024 to conform with current year presentation. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance, the Same Facility results should be examined in connection with our net income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for our

periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nDuring the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, net revenues from our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, increased by $277 million or 12.8%. The increase included approximately $68 million representing the Same Facility basis, acute care hospital services' portion of the $90 million aggregate benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2025 in connection with the Washington, D.C., Medicaid state directed payment program, covering the period of October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025, as mentioned above.\n \nIncome before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased by $133 million, or 65%, amounting to $339 million, or 13.9% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to $206 million, or 9.5% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2024. The increase included the above-mentioned $68 million benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2025 in connection with the Washington, D.C., Medicaid state directed payment program, covering the period of October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025.\n \nDuring the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, net revenue per adjusted admission increased by 9.8% while net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 11.5%, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, inpatient admissions to our acute care hospitals increased by 1.5% while adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased by 2.0%. Patient days at these facilities decreased by 0.1% and adjusted patient days increased by 0.4% during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.8 days during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 65% and 66% during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOn a Same Facility basis, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $41 million, or 4.6%. Contributing to the increase in salaries, wages and benefits was an increase in our patient volumes during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024. As a percentage of net revenues, salaries, wages and benefits expense decreased to 38.6% during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to 41.7% during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther operating expenses increased by $95 million, or 15.8%, during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2025. Operating expenses incurred by our commercial health insurer, consisting primarily of medical costs, increased by $45 million, or 35.8% (due to a corresponding increase in membership), during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024. Excluding the operating costs of our commercial insurer from each period, other operating expenses increased by $49 million, or 10.4%. Contributing to the increased operating expenses during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024, was a $21 million, or 13.3%, aggregate increase in physician expenses incurred at certain hospitals. As a percentage of net revenues, other operating expenses increased to 28.6% during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to 27.8% during the comparable quarter of 2024.\nSupplies expense increased by $12 million, or 3.5%, during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the third quarter of 2024, due, in part, to an increase in patient volumes. As a percentage of net revenues, supplies expense decreased to 14.2% during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to 15.4% during the third quarter of 2024.\nNine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable prior year period, net revenues from our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, increased by $580 million or 9.1%.

The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.8 days and 4.9 days during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 67% during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\n \nOn a Same Facility basis, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $122 million, or 4.7%. Contributing to the increase in salaries, wages and benefits was an increase in our patient volumes during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the comparable period of 2024. As a percentage of net revenues, salaries, wages and benefits expense decreased to 39.4% during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to 41.1% during the first nine months of 2024.\nOther operating expenses increased by $214 million, or 12.2%, during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the comparable period of 2025.

(ii) an other combined net increase of $99 million consisting primarily of $58 million of combined net revenues generated during the third quarter of 2025 at two newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals, as mentioned above, and a $40 million increase in provider tax assessments (which had no impact on income before income taxes since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses).\n \nIncome before income taxes increased by $99 million, or 49%, to $300 million, or 11.4% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to $201 million, or 8.9% of net revenues during the comparable quarter of 2024. The increase resulted primarily from: (i) the $133 million, or 65%, increase in income before income taxes from our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, as discussed above, partially offset by; (ii) a $19 million pre-tax loss incurred during the third quarter of 2025 at the recently completed and opened Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center, and; (iii) an $18 million legal reserve established during the third quarter of 2025 in connection with the verdict in the Pinnacle litigation in Washoe County, Nevada, against certain subsidiaries of ours, as disclosed in\n Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies.\n \n \nDuring the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $74 million, or 8.3%. The increase was due primarily to the above-mentioned $41 million, or 4.6%, increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, as well as the salaries, wages and benefits expense incurred at the two above-mentioned newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals.\n \nOther operating expenses increased by $178 million, or 25.4%, during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024.  The increase was due primarily to: (i) the $95 million above-mentioned increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis; (ii) a $40 million increase in provider tax assessments; (iii) a combined increase of $26 million in operating expenses incurred at the two above-mentioned newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals, and; (iv) the above-mentioned $18 million legal reserve established during the third quarter of 2025 in connection with the verdict in the Pinnacle litigation in Washoe County, Nevada, against certain subsidiaries of ours.\n \nSupplies expense increased by $22 million, or 6.5%, during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024.

The increase resulted primarily from: (i) the $237 million, or 38%, increase in income before income taxes from our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, as discussed above, partially offset by; (ii) a $47 million pre-tax loss incurred during the first nine months of 2025 at Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center, and; (iii) an $18 million legal reserve established during the third quarter of 2025 in connection with the verdict in the Pinnacle litigation in Washoe County, Nevada, against certain subsidiaries of ours.\n \nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $201 million, or 7.7%. The increase was due primarily to the above-mentioned $122 million increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, as well as the salaries, wages and benefits expense incurred at the two above-mentioned newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals.\nOther operating expenses increased by $340 million, or 16.9%, during the first nine months of 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024. The increase was due to: (i) the $214 million above-mentioned increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis; (ii) a $50 million increase in provider tax assessments; (iii) a combined increase of $58 million in operating expenses incurred at the two above-mentioned newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals, and; (iv) the above-mentioned $18 million legal reserve established during the third quarter of 2025 in connection with the verdict in the Pinnacle litigation in Washoe County, Nevada, against certain subsidiaries of ours.\n \nSupplies expense increased by $52 million, or 5.2%, during the first nine months of 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024. The increase was due to the above-mentioned $28 million increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, as well as the supplies expense incurred at the two above-mentioned newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals.\n \nCharity Care and Uninsured Discounts:\nThe following tables show the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nUncompensated care:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmounts in millions\n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharity\n \ncare\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n348\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n227\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n834\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n644\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUninsured discounts\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n716\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n705\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n76\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,103\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n72\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,925\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal uncompensated care\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,064\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n932\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,937\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,569\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nEstimated cost of providing uncompensated care:\nThe estimated costs of providing uncompensated care as reflected below were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.

Our Same Facility results also neutralize (if applicable) the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived and intangible assets and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.\nOur Same Facility basis results reflected on the table below also excludes from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below \nSources of Revenue-Summary of Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs.\n However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under \nAll Behavioral Health Care Services\n. The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses. Prior year amounts related to certain facilities previously included in our Behavioral Health Care Services’ results have been reclassified into our Acute Care Hospital Services' results as of May 1, 2024 to conform with current year presentation. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance, the Same Facility results should be examined in connection with our net income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for our behavioral health care facilities, on a Same Facility basis, and is used in the discussions below for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollar amounts in

The increase was due primarily to the above-mentioned $62 million, or 6.6%, increase related to our behavioral health facilities, on a Same Facility basis, as well as $24 million of other combined net increases consisting primarily of increased provider tax assessments.\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSupplies expense increased by $2 million, or 1.1%, during the first nine months of 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024.\n \nSources of Revenue\nOverview:\n We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.\nHospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control. The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis. We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.\nPatients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year. Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts.\nSources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:\n Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, and the federal and state budget deficits in general may affect the availability of government funds to provide additional relief in the future. Changes resulting from the outcome of the 2024 elections and subsequent legislative and administrative initiatives have included increased scrutiny of Medicare Advantage programs, work requirements for Medicaid waiver program eligibility, increased focus on hospital outpatient site neutral payment policies, and similar initiatives that may reduce the availability of funding for federal healthcare programs or make eligibility for benefits more difficult. Legislation adopted on July 4, 2025 will have the effect of substantially decreasing federal funding for state Medicaid Programs. Any significant reduction in federal Medicaid funding to states would likely result in states reducing Medicaid payments to us which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”) was enacted and its two primary goals were to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses. The ACA revised reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high-quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals. The ACA provides for reductions to Medicaid DSH payments which are scheduled to begin in FFY 2026.\nA 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling limited the federal government’s ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the ACA that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain Medicaid coverage requirements. Pursuant to that decision, the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion by reducing their existing Medicaid funding. Therefore, states can choose to expand or not to expand their Medicaid program without risking the loss of federal Medicaid funding. As a result, many states, including Texas, have not expanded their Medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding. CMS has previously granted section 1115 demonstration waivers providing for work and community engagement requirements for certain Medicaid eligible individuals. CMS has also released guidance to states interested in receiving their Medicaid funding through a block grant mechanism. The Biden administration withdrew certain previously issued section 1115 demonstrations aligned with these policies, but Georgia had imposed work and community engagement requirements under a Medicaid demonstration program that launched July 1, 2023. President Trump, more favorable to work and community engagement requirements in his first administration, sought and obtained legislative work and community engagement applicable to a significant percentage of Medicaid program beneficiaries. We anticipate this change will lead to reductions in Medicaid coverage and likely increases in uncompensated care.\n \nOn December 14, 2018, a Texas Federal District Court deemed the ACA to be unconstitutional in its entirety. The Court concluded that the ACA mandate that individuals maintain coverage was no longer permissible under Congress’s taxing power as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 reducing the individual mandate’s tax to $0 (i.e., it no longer produces revenue, which is an essential feature of a tax). The Court also held that because the individual mandate is “essential” to the ACA and is inseverable from the rest of\n \n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthe law, the entire ACA is unconstitutional. That ruling was ultimately appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which decided in \nCalifornia v. Texas\n that the plaintiffs in the matter lacked standing to bring their constitutionality claims.  The Court did not reach the plaintiffs’ merits arguments, which specifically challenged the constitutionality of the ACA's individual mandate and the entirety of the ACA itself. As a result, the ACA will continue to be law, and the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") and its respective agencies will continue to enforce regulations implementing the law. However, on September 7, 2022, the ACA faced its most recent challenge when a Texas Federal District Court judge, in the case of \nBraidwood Management v. Becerra\n, ruled that a requirement that certain health plans cover services without cost sharing violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution and that the coverage of certain HIV prevention medication violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The decision was ultimately appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which opined in favor of the ACA HIV prevention coverage. The impact of this litigation cannot be predicted.\nThe ACA also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare. The ACA amends several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers. While Congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is not required to “have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of” the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found in violation of such law, the ACA also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The ACA provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil False Claims Act. In December, 2024, CMS changed the standard for identification of an overpayment and now requires the report and return of an overpayment if a provider or supplier has actual knowledge of the existence of an overpayment or acts in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of an overpayment. The ACA also expanded the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid. These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.\nWe have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities. These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law. The ACA permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a “grandfather” clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital. The ACA also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities. A repeal of the ACA, in whole or in relevant part, may result in physicians being able to expand ownership interest in hospitals.\nIn addition to legislative changes, the ACA can be significantly impacted by executive branch actions. The Biden administration had issued executive orders implementing a special enrollment period permitting individuals to enroll in health plans outside of the annual open enrollment period and reexamining policies that may undermine the ACA or the Medicaid program. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021's expansion of subsidies to purchase coverage through an exchange contributed to increased exchange enrollment in 2021. The IRA’s extension of subsidies through 2025 increased exchange enrollment in years sequent to 2021. However, the Trump administration has already taken steps to undo these Biden-era initiatives, including those intended to increase ACA exchange and Medicaid enrollment.\nIt remains unclear what portions of the ACA may remain, or whether any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation.  Any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally, and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by our hospitals.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation will not have a negative financial impact on our hospitals, including their ability to compete with alternative healthcare services funded by such potential legislation, or for our hospitals to receive payment for services. Extension of these subsidies is currently the subject of Congressional debate as part of the federal budget negotiation, and we cannot predict whether these subsidies will ultimately be adopted in federal fiscal year 2026.\nFor additional disclosure related to our revenues including a disaggregation of our consolidated net revenues by major source for each of the periods presented herein, please see \nNote 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Revenue Recognition\n.\nMedicare:\n Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities. Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.\nUnder the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient’s Medicare severity diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nactual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an “outlier” payment if a particular patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold. MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,” gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.\nIn July, 2025, CMS published its IPPS 2026 final payment rule which provides for a 3.3% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments, and adjustments mandated by the Legislation are considered (including a -0.7% productivity adjustment offset), without consideration for the required Medicare DSH payments changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments is approximately 1.0%.  Instead of applying a state-level rural floor budget neutrality adjustment to the wage index, the final rule has applied a uniform, national budget neutrality adjustment to the FY 2026 wage index for the rural floor. Nevada will be subject to a 5.0% reduction in the wage index adjustment as a result of a decrease in the wage index rural floor in that state. Including DSH payments, a decrease to the Medicare Outlier threshold and certain other adjustments, we estimate our overall increase from the final IPPS 2026 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2025 through September 30, 2026) will approximate 2.7%.\nIn August, 2024, CMS published its IPPS 2025 final payment rule which provides for a 2.9% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments, and adjustments mandated by the ACA are considered, without consideration for the required Medicare DSH payments changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments is approximately 1.8%. Including DSH payments, an increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold and certain other adjustments, we estimate our overall increase from the final IPPS 2025 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025) will approximate 1.2%.\nIn August, 2023, CMS published its IPPS 2024 final payment rule which provides for a 3.1% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates (including a change in the Medicare Rural Floor calculation), documenting and coding adjustments, and adjustments mandated by the ACA are considered, without consideration for the required Medicare DSH payments changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments is approximately 6.6%. Including DSH payments, an increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold and certain other adjustments, our overall increase from the final IPPS 2024 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024) was approximately 5.4%.\nIn June, 2019, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a decision favorable to hospitals impacting prior year Medicare DSH payments (\nAzar v. Allina Health Services\n, No. 17-1484 (U.S. Jun. 3, 2019)).  In \nAllina\n, the hospitals challenged the Medicare DSH adjustments for federal fiscal year 2012, specifically challenging CMS’s decision to include inpatient hospital days attributable to Medicare Part C enrollee patients in the numerator and denominator of the Medicare/SSI fraction used to calculate a hospital’s DSH payments.  This ruling addresses CMS’s attempts to impose the policy espoused in its vacated 2004 rulemaking to a fiscal year in the 2004–2013 time period without using notice-and-comment rulemaking. This decision should require CMS to recalculate hospitals’ DSH Medicare/SSI fractions, with Medicare Part C days excluded, for at least federal fiscal year 2012, but likely federal fiscal years 2005 through 2013. In June, 2023, CMS issued a rule to retroactively negate the effects of the aforementioned Supreme Court decision. Although we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately receive additional funds, we estimate that the court ruling and final impacts on prior year hospital Medicare DSH payments range between $18 million to $28 million in the aggregate.\nThe 2011 Act included the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year. Subsequent legislation has extended this sequestration through 2032.  The CARES Act, as amended, temporarily suspended or limited the application of this sequestration from May 1, 2020 through June 30, 2022, with a return to the full 2% Medicare payment reduction thereafter.\nInpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program are paid under a Psychiatric Prospective Payment System (“Psych PPS”). Medicare payments to psychiatric hospitals are based on a prospective per diem rate with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics. The Psych PPS also contains provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department.\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn August, 2025, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2026. Under this final rule, payments to our behavioral health care hospitals and units from the market basket update are estimated to increase by 2.5% compared to federal fiscal year 2025. This amount includes the effect of the 3.2% net market basket update which reflects the offset of a 0.7% productivity adjustment. When all of the final patient level adjustments described below as well as proposed wage index values are considered, we estimate that Psych PPS payments will increase by 1.7% in FFY 2026.\nIn July, 2024, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2025. Under this final rule, payments to our behavioral health care hospitals and units from the market basket update are estimated to increase by 2.8% compared to federal fiscal year 2024. This amount includes the effect of the 3.3% net market basket update which reflects the offset of a 0.5% productivity adjustment. When all of the final patient level adjustments described below as well as proposed wage index values are considered, we estimate that Psych PPS payments will increase by 2.1% in FFY 2025.\nIn addition to the market basket update noted above, CMS made the following changes:\n•\nRevisions to the methodology for determining the payment rates under the Inpatient Psychiatric Facility (\"IPF\") PPS for psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units based on a review of the data and information collected in prior years in accordance with section 1886(s)(5)(A) of the Social Security Act, as added by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (\"CAA of 2023\"). CMS finalized revisions to the IPF patient-level adjustment factors. The patient-level adjustments include Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS–DRGs) assignment of the patient’s principal diagnosis, selected comorbidities, patient age, and the variable per diem adjustments;\n•\nImplement these revisions in a budget-neutral manner (that is, estimated payments to IPFs for FFY 2025 would be the same with or without the final revisions), and;\n•\nClarified the criteria regarding all-inclusive cost reporting. This clarification requires our behavioral health care hospitals, which are currently utilizing an all-inclusive charging practice, to modify both their billing practices and information technology applications by June 1, 2025 to ensure compliance with future regulations. We intend to be in compliance with this CMS billing requirement.\nThis final rule also includes two requests for information on future revisions to the IPF PPS facility-level adjustment factors and development of the new standardized IPF Patient Assessment Instrument, required by the CAA of 2023, which IPFs participating in the IPF Quality Reporting Program will be required to report for Rate Year 2028.\nIn July, 2023, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2024. Under this final rule, payments to our behavioral health care hospitals and units increased by approximately 3.3% compared to federal fiscal year 2023. This amount includes the effect of the 3.5% net market basket update which reflects the offset of a 0.2% productivity adjustment.\nIn July, 2025, CMS issued its OPPS proposed rule for 2026. The hospital market basket increase is 3.2% and the productivity adjustment reduction is 0.8% for a net market basket increase of 2.4%. When other statutorily required adjustments (including a 1.95% reduction for the 340B remedy discussed below) and hospital patient service mix are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2026 will aggregate to a net increase of 0.1%.\nSome key changes in the 2026 OPPS proposed rule include:\n \n340B Remedy Recoupment:\nCMS is proposing to shorten the 340B Remedy recoupment transition from 16 years to 5 years. A 2023 CMS final rule had implemented a negative OPPS recoupment adjustment of 0.5 percent for approximately 16 years to offset $7.8 billion paid to hospitals for non-drug OPPS payments between 2018 and 2022 – following the US Supreme Court decision overturning the Trump Administration’s 340B reduction policy.  CMS now proposes to increase the annual offset of 0.5 percent to 2 percent effective CY 2026 and to remain in effect until the estimated payment reduction reaches $7.8 billion, which CMS estimates will occur in CY 2031.\n \nEliminating the Inpatient Only (IPO) List:\n \nCMS is proposing to phase out the IPO list over a 3-year period, beginning with removing 285 mostly musculoskeletal procedures for CY 2026.  Procedures removed from the IPO list would be exempted from certain medical review activities related to the two-midnight policy for CY 2026 and subsequent years until CMS determines the service or procedure is more commonly performed in the Medicare population in the outpatient setting. We are unable to estimate the potential financial impact of this proposal.\n \nOn November 2, 2023, in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in \nAmerican Hospital Association v. Becerra\n (142 S. Ct. 1896 (2022)) and the district court’s remand to the agency, CMS issued a final rule outlining the remedy for the 340B-acquired drug payment policy for calendar years 2018-2022. CMS published the final rule to remedy the payment rates the Court held were invalid aspects of their past policy and will affect nearly all hospitals paid under the OPPS.  As part of the final remedy, CMS will make an adjustment to the update factor to maintain budget neutrality as required by statute. CMS finalized the 340B policy for calendar year 2018 in 2017 in a budget neutral manner that included increasing payments for non-drug items and services; this payment increase was in effect from calendar years 2018 through 2022. CMS estimates that hospitals were paid $7.8 billion more for non-drug items and services during\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthis time period than they would have been paid in the absence of the 340B payment policy.  Because CMS is now making additional payments to affected 340B covered entity hospitals to pay them what they would have been paid had the 340B policy never been implemented, CMS will make a corresponding offset to maintain budget neutrality as if the 340B payment policy had never been in effect. To carry out this required $7.8 billion budget neutrality adjustment, CMS will reduce future non-drug item and service payments by adjusting the OPPS conversion factor by minus 0.5% starting in calendar year 2026 and continuing for 16 years. As discussed above, as noted in the 2026 OPPS proposed rule, CMS is proposing to shorten the recovery period of the $7.8 billion from 17 years to 5 years starting in calendar year 2026 with a 2.0% reduction to non-drug item and service payments.\nThe estimated impact of this 2.0% reduction on our projected 2026 results of operations related to both Medicare and Medicare Advantage is approximately $13 million.\nIn November, 2024, CMS issued its OPPS final rule for 2025. The hospital market basket increase is 3.4% and the productivity adjustment reduction is 0.5% for a net market basket increase of 2.9%. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, including a 14.2% increase to the partial hospitalization rate, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2025 will aggregate to a net increase of 3.6%.\nIn November, 2023, CMS issued its OPPS final rule for 2024. The hospital market basket increase is 3.3% and the productivity adjustment reduction is 0.2% for a net market basket increase of 3.1%. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2024 aggregated to a net increase of approximately 9.7%. This percentage reflects the impact resulting from rural floor changes to the Medicare wage index adjustment factor where certain states, such as California and Nevada, will materially benefit from this change.\nIn November, 2022, CMS issued its OPPS final rule for 2023. The hospital market basket increase is 4.1% and the productivity adjustment reduction is -0.3% for a net market basket increase of 3.8%.  The final rule provides that in light of the Supreme Court decision in \nAmerican Hospital Association v. Becerra\n, CMS applied the default rate, generally average sales price plus 6%, to 340B acquired drugs and biologicals for 2023.  During the 2018-2022 time period, we recorded an aggregate of approximately $45 million to $50 million of Medicare revenues related to the prior 340B payment policy. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, as well as impact of the aforementioned 340B Program policy change, our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2023 aggregated to a net increase of approximately 0.9% which includes a 0.3% increase to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates.\nIn November, 2019, CMS finalized its Hospital Price Transparency rule that implements certain requirements under the June 24, 2019 Presidential Executive Order related to Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First. Under this final rule, effective January 1, 2021, CMS will require: hospitals to make public: (1) their standard changes (both gross charges and payer-specific negotiated charges) for all items and services online in a machine-readable format, and; (2) standard charge data for a limited set of “shoppable services” the hospital provides in a form and manner that is more consumer friendly. On November 2, 2021, CMS released a final rule increasing the monetary penalty that CMS can impose on hospitals that fail to comply with the price transparency requirements. We believe that our hospitals are in full compliance with the applicable federal regulations. In November, 2023, CMS finalized multiple provisions, effective as of January 1, 2024, focused on increasing hospital price transparency and compliance enforcement including but not limited to: (1) standard charges data would be posted online using a CMS template, instead of using the hospital’s own form/format; (2) all standard charge information would be encoded with a specified set of data elements (e.g., hospital name; license number; payer/plan name; description of service; billing codes, among others); (3) other technical changes related to increasing consumers’ automated accessibility to hospital standard charges, and; (4) certifications regarding accuracy of standard charge data and related compliance warning notices from CMS and requiring accessibility to health system leadership regarding transparency noncompliance.\nIn September, 2024, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and the Treasury published final rules that:\n•\nMandate that insurers analyze the outcomes of their coverage to ensure there's equivalent access to mental health care, including provider networks, prior authorization rates and payment for out-of-network providers, and take action to get in compliance;\n•\nEstablish when health plans can’t use prior authorization or other tactics to make it more difficult to access mental health and substance use treatment, and;\n•\nRequire additional insurers to comply with the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act.\nWhile these rules will likely improve patient access to inpatient and outpatient mental health services, we are unable to estimate the related potential impact on our results of operations.\nMedicaid:\n Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nportion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.\nWe receive revenues from various state and county-based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate. We receive annual Medicaid revenues of approximately $100 million, or greater, from each of Texas, California, Nevada, Washington, D.C., Illinois, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Florida, Mississippi and Washington.  We also receive Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including, most significantly, Texas. Many of these programs have a Medicaid supplemental payment component that are subject to approval on a year-to-year basis and there is no assurance that these supplemental payment revenues will continue at their current rates or at all. We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state-based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. We can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nThe ACA substantially increases the federally and state-funded Medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-Medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for Medicaid starting in 2014. However, the Supreme Court has struck down portions of the ACA requiring states to expand their Medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding. Accordingly, many states in which we operate have not expanded Medicaid coverage to individuals at 133% of the federal poverty level. Facilities in states not opting to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in fiscal year 2024, as discussed below. We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nSummary of Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs:\nThe following table summarizes the revenues, healthcare provider taxes (“Provider Taxes”) and net benefit related to each of the below-mentioned Medicaid supplemental programs for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.  The Provider Taxes are recorded in other operating expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as included herein. The \"Projected Full Year 2025\" amounts reflected on the table below are, in many cases, subject to federal and potentially state approval and may be affected by any reductions or other changes in

our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas participate in Medicaid supplemental payment Section 1115 Waiver indigent care programs. The 1115 Waiver has been approved by CMS through September 30, 2030. These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties. Our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals. The supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer (“IGT”) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. However, the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any IGT on the amount of any private hospital’s indigent care obligation.\nCHIRP (including QIF)\nOn August 1, 2022, CMS approved the Comprehensive Hospital Increase Reimbursement Program (\"CHIRP\"), with a pool of $5.2 billion, for the rate period effective September 1, 2022 to August 31, 2023. On July 31, 2023, CMS approved the CHIRP program, with a pool of $6.5 billion, for the rate period of September 1, 2023 to August 31, 2024. On September 13, 2024, CMS approved the CHIRP program with a pool of $6.5 billion for the rate period September 1, 2024 to August 31, 2025 (with an amended CMS approval\n \n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\non October 1, 2024). A CHIRP preprint for the rate period September 1, 2025 to August 31, 2026 was approved by CMS in August, 2025 with a pool size of $9.2 billion. This program is estimated to increase reimbursement to our hospitals by approximately $20 million to $23 million in program year 2026.\nOn January 26, 2024, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (\"THHSC\") issued a final rule that will modify the CHIRP payments beginning with the State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2025 rate period to promote the advancement of the quality goals and strategies the program is designed to advance.\nThe final modifications include:\n•\nCreation of a new pay-for-performance incentive payment through a third component in CHIRP, the Alternate Participating Hospital Reimbursement for Improving Quality Award (\"APHRIQA\"). For state fiscal years beginning with SFY 2025, behavioral health hospitals and rural hospitals will not be included in the pay-for-performance program, and;.\n•\nThe funds for payment of the APHRIQA component will be transitioned from the existing uniform rate increase components of the Uniform Hospital Rate Increase Percentage and the Average Commercial Incentive Award and will be paid using a scorecard that directs managed care organizations to pay providers for performance achievements on quality outcome measures. Payments will be distributed under APHRIQA on a semi-annual basis that aligns with the measurement period determined for quality metrics reporting.\nCHIRP payment levels could be reduced materially if our hospitals are not able meet the required APHRIQA pay-for-performance metrics.  The Company’s hospitals in this program have met 100% of the applicable APHRIQA pay-for-performance metrics for SFY 2025.\nIn connection with the Quality Incentive Fund (“QIF”), the results of operations of certain of our acute care hospitals located in Texas included $21 million and $36 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. QIF revenues are earned pursuant to contract terms with various Medicaid managed care plans which requires the annual payout of QIF funds when a managed care service delivery area’s actual claims-based CHIRP payments are less than targeted CHIRP payments for a specific rate year.\nWe estimate that these hospitals will be entitled to approximately $32 million of aggregate QIF revenues during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nUC\n Included in these provider tax programs are reimbursements received in connection with the Texas Uncompensated Care program (\"UC\"). The size and distribution of the UC pool are determined based on charity care costs reported to THHSC in accordance with Medicare cost report Worksheet S-10 principles.\nHARP\nOn September 24, 2021, THHSC finalized New Fee-for-Service Supplemental Payment Program: Hospital Augmented Reimbursement Program (“HARP”) to be effective October 1, 2021. The HARP program continues the financial transition for providers who have historically participated in the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment program described below. The program, which was approved by CMS on August 15, 2023, will provide additional funding to hospitals to help offset the cost hospitals incur while providing Medicaid services. HARP is technically a Medicaid Upper Payment Limit as payment under this program is based on a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for the services under Medicare payment principles but is referred to as HARP by THHSC.\n \nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $6 million and $7 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively and, approximately $18 million and $21 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe expect our net reimbursements pursuant to HARP to approximate $24 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nNevada State Directed Payment Program (\"SDP\"):\nAs previously reported, in February, 2023, the Nevada Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (“DHCFP”) outlined a new provider fee on private hospitals located in Nevada that would effectively capture new Medicaid federal share for certain categories of services eligible for the new payment program. In late December, 2023, CMS approved the Medicaid managed care component of the Nevada SDP program, with an effective date of January 1, 2024. In November 2024, CMS approved an increased assessment rate which funded an increase in the SDP pool size covering the period of July 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. Payments made pursuant to this component of the Nevada SDP program, which requires annual approval by CMS, are subject to reconciliation by DHCFP based on actual Medicaid managed care utilization during 2024. There can be no assurance that the Medicaid managed care component of the Nevada SDP will continue for any period after December 31, 2025, or that it will not be modified.\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $58 million and $42 million during the\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthree-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively and, approximately $171 million and $121 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nThe Nevada SDP for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025 has been approved by CMS. We estimate that our aggregate net reimbursements pursuant to both components of the Nevada SDP program (net of related provider taxes) will approximate $229 million during the year ended December 31, 2025. The DCHFP submitted a revised SDP preprint for the period January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025. If approved as submitted, we estimate that the aggregate net benefit applicable to our facilities could increase by approximately $30 million covering the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025. This incremental increase to the Nevada SDP program is not reflected in the above Medicaid Supplemental Provider Tax table.\n \nVarious Other State Programs:\nWe receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental Medicaid payment programs. The states include, but are not limited to, the state programs listed below from which we receive significant reimbursements.\nKentucky Hospital Rate Increase Program (“HRIP”)\nIn early 2021, CMS approved the Kentucky Medicaid Managed Care Hospital Rate Increase Program. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $21 million and $19 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively and, approximately $64 million and $61 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.  In December, 2024, CMS approved the program for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025 at rates comparable to the prior year.\n \nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to HRIP will approximate $90 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nCalifornia Supplemental Payments\nIn California, the state continues to operate Medicaid supplemental payment programs consisting of three components: Fee For Service Payment, Managed Care-Pass-Through Payment and Managed Care-Directed Payment. The non-federal share for these programs are financed by a statewide provider tax. The Directed Payment method will be based on actual concurrent hospital Medicaid managed care in-network patient volume whereas the other programs are based on prior year Medicaid utilization. The CMS program approval status is outlined in the table below.\nCalifornia Hospital Fee Program CMS Approval Status\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHospital Fee Program Component\n\n\nCMS Methodology Approval\n\n\nCMS Rate Setting Approval Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStatus\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFee For Service Payment\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2024\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2024; Paid through December 31, 2024\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaged Care-Pass-Through Payment\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2024\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2022 and paid in advance through December 31, 2024\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaged Care-Directed Payment\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2024\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2022 and paid in advance through December 31, 2023\n \n\n\n\n\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $21 million and $8 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and approximately $53 million and $34 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. During the first quarter of 2025, the Department of Health Care Services submitted a final draft of the Hospital Quality Assurance Fee program 9 fee to CMS for approval for the period January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 and a subsequent amendment in July 2025.  This submission includes the Managed Care-Directed Payment preprint.  We are unable to predict the outcome, amount or timing of any related increase that may result from this submission.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $68 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nMississippi Hospital Access Program\nIn September, 2023, subject to CMS approval, Mississippi announced a $689 million, two-part Medicaid payment proposal, effective retroactively to July 1, 2023, that would be funded by annual hospital assessments to the state's Medicaid program. These hospital assessments are calculated using a formula provided under state law. The first part of the program, known as the Mississippi Hospital Access Program (“MHAP”), provides direct payments for hospitals that serve patients in the state's Medicaid managed care delivery system. Hospitals are reimbursed near the average commercial rate, which is the upper limit (\"UPL\") for Medicaid managed care\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nreimbursements. The second part of the program supplements traditional Medicaid payment rates for hospitals providing inpatient and outpatient services up to Medicaid's regulated UPL. In September 2025, CMS approved the MHAP program component for the period July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026. The UPL component was approved in April 2024.\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $11 million during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and approximately $40 million and $38 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to these supplemental payment programs will approximate $51 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nFlorida Medicaid Managed Care Directed Payment Program (“DPP”) and Low Income Payment (“LIP”)\nThe Florida DPP provides for an additional payment for Medicaid managed care contracted services. The LIP program provides payment for hospital uncompensated care under the 1115 Medicaid Waiver.  For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 no revenue was recorded in connection with the DPP program (substantially all of this DPP revenue is recorded during the fourth quarters of each year).  In connection with the LIP program, $2 million and $12 million of net reimbursements (net of provider taxes) were recorded during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025, respectively.\nWe estimate that our reimbursements pursuant to this DPP and LIP will approximate $57 million during the year ended December 31, 2025. The Florida DPP for the period of October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025 is under CMS' review for approval. The submitted DPP preprint includes a request to increase the size of the program and related DPP add-on payment levels based on a percentage of average commercial rates. If approved as submitted, we estimate that the aggregate net benefit applicable to our facilities could increase by approximately $47 million on an annual basis.  This incremental increase to the Florida DPP program is not reflected in the above Medicaid Supplemental Provider Tax table.\nIllinois Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs\nThe Illinois Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs are comprised of three components: (1) Medicaid managed care directed payment program; (2) Medicaid managed care pass-through program, and; (3) Medicaid fee for service supplemental payment program. These programs require various related legislative and regulatory approvals each year.\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $9 million during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and approximately $27 million and $28 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to these supplemental payment programs will approximate $32 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.  CMS approval of these programs for the period of January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 occurred in September 2025.\nIndiana Medicaid Managed Care DPP\nThe Indiana DPP provides for an additional payment for Medicaid managed care contracted services. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $8 million during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and approximately $24 million during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. CMS has approved this program through September 30, 2025.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $33 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nOklahoma (Transition to Managed Care and Implementation of a Medicaid Managed Care DPP)\nThe current Oklahoma Medicaid supplemental payment program in effect, prior to the planned implementation of the new DPP in 2024, is the Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program (“SHOPP”). The SHOPP component will remain in place for certain categories of Medicaid patients that will continue to be enrolled in the traditional Medicaid Fee for Service program.\nIn May, 2022, Oklahoma enacted legislation that directs the Oklahoma Health Care Authority (\"OHCA\") to: (i) transition its Medicaid program from a fee for service payment model to a managed care payment model by no later than October 1, 2023, and: (ii) concurrently implement a Medicaid managed care DPP using a managed care gap of 90% of average commercial rates. In December, 2022, the OHCA delayed the implementation date of the Medicaid managed care change and related DPP until April 1, 2024.  In September, 2023, CMS approved the DPP program for the 15-month period effective as of April 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025.  CMS approval of the DPP program for the period July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026 is pending.\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $7 million and $6 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and approximately $19 million and $14 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to these two supplemental payment programs (i.e. SHOPP and DPP) will approximate $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nSouth Carolina Health Access, Workforce and Quality (“HAWQ”) Program\nIn September 2023, CMS approved the South Carolina HAWQ Program retroactive to July 1, 2023 and subsequently approved by CMS in July, 2024 for the period of July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025. This program is a Medicaid managed care directed payment program that provides for a rate enhancement to Medicaid managed care encounters. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $4 million and $9 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and approximately $23 million and $19 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $29 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nMichigan Directed Payment Program (“DPP”)\nIn March 2024, CMS approved the Michigan Medicaid DPP retroactive to October 1, 2023 based on average commercial rates. The Michigan DPP provides for an additional payment for Medicaid managed care contracted services. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $13 million and $9 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and approximately $35 million and $29 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $47 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.  The Michigan DPP for the period of October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025 was approved by CMS.\nIdaho Upper Payment Limit (“UPL”)\nIn April 2024, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (“IDHW”) released its updated Medicaid UPL calculation for SFY 2024 (July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024) and revised its SFY 2023 (July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023) UPL calculation. Subject to CMS approval, the IDHW plans to continue this UPL program through SFY 2025 (July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025) at payment levels comparable to SFY 2024. In SFY 2026, the IDHW intends to replace the UPL program with a Medicaid managed care state directed payment program. We are unable to predict whether payments levels under the planned new state directed payment program will be comparable to the SFY 2025 UPL payment levels.\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $5 million during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and approximately $21 million and $27 million recorded during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nWashington Safety Net Assessment Program\nOn April 2, 2024, CMS approved an expanded state directed payment program in Washington whereby payments will now be based on the average commercial rates. The program was approved retroactively for the period January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024.\n \nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $13 million and $12 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and approximately $39 million and $32 million recorded during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursement pursuant to this expanded program will approximate $51 million during the year ended December 31, 2025. The program for the period of January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 was approved by CMS.\nNew Mexico State Directed Payment Program (“SDP”)\n \nIn November, 2024, CMS approved the New Mexico Medicaid SDP, retroactive to July 1, 2024, based on average commercial rates. The New Mexico SDP provides for an additional payment for Medicaid managed care contracted services.  The program requires the submission of an annual report that demonstrates that 75% of the incremental net funds were used for the delivery of and access to healthcare services in the state.\nThe New Mexico SDP for the period of January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 was approved by CMS.\n \nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $10 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025 and, approximately $25 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025.  No revenue was recorded during the three-month or nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $30 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nTennessee Directed Payment Program (“DPP”)\nTennessee SB1740, enacted in May, 2024, imposes an annual coverage assessment on covered hospitals for fiscal year 2024-2025. The total assessment on all covered hospitals in the aggregate will be equal to 6% of the federally recognized annual coverage assessment base. The assessment proceeds will be used to fund an increase to the state’s DPP payment pool to be based on average commercial rates.\n \nIn January, 2025, CMS approved the DPP payment increase for the period July 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, contingent upon CMS' approval of the state's 1115 Medicaid Waiver amendment. In addition, the DPP program for calendar year 2025 (January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025) was approved by CMS in April, 2025, also contingent upon CMS' approval of the state's 1115 Medicaid Waiver amendment which was approved by CMS in June, 2025.\nDuring the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, we recorded $11 million in net reimbursements from this program and $69 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 ($29 million of which related to the period of July 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024). No revenue was recorded during the three-month or nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 related to the DPP program.\n \nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $83 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n \nWashington, D.C. State Directed Payment program (“SDP”)\nIn September, 2025, CMS approved the SDP program for the period October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025.  This SDP program provides for an add-on to in-network Medicaid managed care paid claims.\n \nIncluded in our results of operations during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025, was $90 million of reimbursements (net of related provider taxes), covering the period of October 1, 2024 through September 30,2025 in connection with this program. We estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program, including the recently opened acute care hospital, will approximate $117 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n \nTexas DSH and Nevada SPA Programs:\nTexas DSH\nUpon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas’ low income patients, our qualifying facilities located in Texas receive additional reimbursement from the state’s DSH fund. The Texas DSH program was renewed for the state’s 2026 DSH fiscal year (covering the period of October 1, 2025 through September 30, 2026).\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $12 million and $14 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively and, approximately $27 million and $28 million was recorded during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our aggregate net reimbursements earned pursuant to the Texas DSH program will approximate $33 million during year ended December 31, 2025.\nThe ACA and subsequent federal legislation provides for a significant reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2026 (see above in Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform-Medicaid for additional disclosure related to the delay of these DSH reductions). HHS is to determine the amount of Medicaid DSH payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology. As Medicaid DSH payments to states will be cut, consequently, payments to Medicaid-participating providers, including our hospitals in Texas, will be reduced in the coming years. Based on the CMS final rule published in September, 2019 (as amended by the CARES Act and the CAA), beginning in fiscal year 2026, annual Medicaid DSH payments in Texas could be reduced by approximately 33% from current DSH payment levels. However, states have discretion in the allocation of their respective federal DSH allotment and we do not believe the state's allocation will result in a material decrease to DSH payment levels to our hospitals located in Texas. A series of federal continuing resolutions were passed by the federal government which provided for ongoing federal funding.\nIn connection with certain previous DSH and UC adverse federal court decisions, including the \nChildren’s Hospital Association of Texas v. Azar, \nwe continue to maintain reserves in the financial statements for cumulative Medicaid DSH and UC reimbursements related to our behavioral health hospitals located in Texas that amounted to $35 million as of September 30, 2025 and $34 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNevada State Plan Amendment (\"SPA\")\nCMS initially approved an SPA in Nevada in August, 2014 and this SPA has been approved for additional state fiscal years, including the 2024 fiscal year covering the period of July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024. CMS approval for the 2025 fiscal year, which is still pending, is expected to occur.\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $4 million during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and approximately $13 million during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $18 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nLegislation Commonly Known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBBA\")\nThe OBBBA was enacted into law on July 4, 2025. This legislation includes material changes to the Medicaid program and other healthcare related programs including but not limited to:\nMedicaid State Directed Payments (“SDP”)\n \n•\nIn states that expanded their Medicaid programs under the ACA (\"Expansion States\"), the SDP payment rate is capped at 100% of Medicare.\n•\nFor states that did not expand Medicaid under the ACA (\"Non-Expansion States\"), the SDP rate is capped at 110% of Medicare.\n•\nThese provisions grandfathered SDP programs already in existence or pending approval from CMS. Beginning with the 2028 state fiscal years, SDP provisions pursuant to the OBBBA are being phased in whereby grandfathered payment plans will be reduced by no more than 10% annually until the applicable Medicare rate is reached.\n \nLimits on Provider Taxes\n•\nPrior law capped Provider Taxes at 6% of net patient revenue. The new law reduces the percentage of revenue that can be taxed as a Provider Tax.\n•\nThe Provider Tax provisions pursuant to the OBBBA are largely being phased in over a 5-year period. \n•\nIn Expansion States, beginning with the 2028 state fiscal years, this percentage will be reduced by 0.5% each year until it reaches 3.5%. In Non-Expansion States, the Provider Tax percentage will remain unchanged. \n•\nEstablishes new discretion for CMS to refuse waivers of Provider Tax uniformity requirement.\n \nRural Health Transformation Program\n•\nEstablishes a $50 billion rural health grant program for states between fiscal years 2026 and 2030 to be used for payments to rural health facilities. 50% of the fund will go to states equally and 50% will be allocated based on a rural formula determined by the HHS Secretary.\n•\nAlthough certain of our hospitals that are designated by CMS as rural may be eligible for reimbursement pursuant to this fund,\n \nwe are unable to predict if any of our facilities will ultimately qualify for reimbursement and are therefore unable to quantify any potential favorable impact on our future results of operations.   \n \nMedicaid Eligibility:\n•\nInstitutes an 80-hour a month work requirement for all Medicaid individuals ages 19-64, with some exceptions. \n•\nRequires states to conduct eligibility redeterminations at least every 6 months for Medicaid expansion adults effective on or after December 31, 2026.\n•\nAlthough we cannot predict the potential unfavorable impact on our future results of operations from these changes to Medicaid eligibility requirements, these changes could reduce the overall number of Medicaid enrollees thereby potentially decreasing our Medicaid revenues (including revenues earned pursuant to various state Medicaid supplemental payment programs) while potentially increasing the level of uncompensated care provided by our facilities.   \nAs noted above, the OBBBA has specific legislative language that will reduce SDP payments as well as limit Provider Taxes used by states to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid supplemental payments.  However, certain OBBBA provisions that would impact payment levels could be subject to some interpretation by CMS and related future federal rulemaking such as the definition of an SDP grandfathered program.\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBased upon our current projected 2025 full year net benefit related to various state Medicaid supplemental payment programs, amounting to approximately $1.322 billion, as reflected on the table above in \nSummary of Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs, \nwe estimate that, commencing with the 2028 state fiscal years, our aggregate annual net benefit will be reduced, on an annually increasing and relatively pro rata basis, by approximately $420 million to $470 million in 2032. We cannot predict, among other things, if this legislation will ultimately be implemented as enacted, or if certain states may attempt to modify their respective SDP program in response to the OBBBA legislation. Given the various uncertainties and evolving state-by-state interpretations and computations related to this legislation, our forecasted estimates are subject to change, potentially by material amounts.\n \nOther Risk Factors Related To State Supplemental Medicaid Payments:\nAs outlined above, we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental Medicaid payment programs. Failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states’ share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive supplemental Medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could cause our estimates to differ by material amounts which could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nIn April, 2016, CMS published its final Medicaid Managed Care Rule which explicitly permits but phases out the use of pass-through payments (including supplemental payments) by Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (“MCO”) to hospitals over ten years but allows for a transition of the pass-through payments into value-based payment structures, delivery system reform initiatives or payments tied to services under a MCO contract. Since we are unable to determine the financial impact of this aspect of the final rule, we can provide no assurance that the final rule will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. In November, 2020, CMS issued a final rule permitting pass-through supplemental provider payments during a time-limited period when states transition populations or services from fee-for-service Medicaid to managed care.\nWe receive Medicaid SDP payments from MCOs authorized by CMS under 42 CFR § 438.6(c). Consistent with capitated rates paid by Medicaid state agencies to MCO’s for managing Medicaid beneficiary lives under a risk-based arrangement, SDP program related capitated rates must also be developed by the state in accordance with actuarial soundness standards noted at 42 CFR § 438.4 and non-compliance could result in a reduction to SDP payment levels. In general, Medicaid SDP payments under 42 CFR § 438.6(c) are subject to annual CMS approval via the submission of a preprint application by a state agency which provides details of the SDP payment methodology and conformity with the applicable federal regulations. CMS SDP preprint approval, and the timing of such approval (if it occurs), are uncertain, which can affect both the SDP payment level and the timing of SDP revenue we record.\nWe incur Provider Taxes imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services that are used by respective states to finance the non-federal share of SDP’s (or other Medicaid supplemental payment programs). Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid supplemental payment programs. States are subject to CMS both concurrent and retrospective review for their compliance with the applicable Provider Tax regulations and related federal statute. If CMS determines Provider Taxes used by a state Medicaid program to finance the non-federal share of a SDP (or other Medicaid supplemental payment programs) are not in compliance with the applicable Provider Tax regulations and related federal statute, Company SDP payments (and other Medicaid supplemental payments) could be subject to recoupment by the respective state agency when non-compliance is determined by CMS to exist.\nWe believe that the SDP (and other state supplemental payment) programs are designed by each state to be in full compliance with the applicable federal regulations and federal statutes. However, we are unable to provide assurance CMS will determine on a retroactive basis that a state’s SDP (or other Medicaid supplemental payment program) design and Medicaid financing structures is in full compliance with the applicable federal regulations and federal statute(s).\nOn April 22, 2024, CMS issued Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\") Managed Care Access, Finance, and Quality Final Rule (“Managed Care Rule”).  CMS intends for the Managed Care Rule to:\n•\nStrengthen standard for timely access to care and states’ monitoring and enforcement efforts; \n•\nEnhance quality and fiscal and program integrity standards for state directed payments (“SDPs”);\n•\nSpecify the scope of in lieu of services and settings to better address health-related social needs;\n•\nFurther specify medical loss ratio requirements, and;\n•\nEstablish a quality rating system for Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans.\n \nThe SDP provisions included in the Managed Care Rule:\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nRequires that provider payment levels for state directed payments for inpatient and outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, and the professional services at an academic medical center not exceed the average commercial rate;\n•\nProhibits the use of post-payment reconciliation processes for state directed payments that are based on fee schedules;\n•\nMakes explicit in regulation the existing requirement that state directed payments must comply with all federal laws concerning funding sources of the non-federal share, and;\n•\nRequires that states ensure each provider receiving a state directed payment attest that it does not participate in any arrangement that holds taxpayers harmless for the cost of a tax. CMS concurrently released an informational bulletin regarding CMS’ exercise of enforcement discretion until calendar year 2028 for existing health-care related tax programs with certain hold-harmless arrangements involving the redistribution of Medicaid payments.\nFee-For-Service Short-Doyle Medi-Cal (“SD/MC”) Hospitals Change In Payment Methodology:\nUnder the California Medicaid prepaid inpatient health plan program, counties are required to ensure delivery of mental health services utilizing a system of county operated and contract providers. The California Medicaid program has adopted a new reimbursement method for inpatient psychiatric services with an effective date of December 12, 2023, incorporated a cost-based ceiling to negotiated rates.  This change may require renegotiation of contracts Company hospitals have had with counties, retroactive to December 12, 2023, and may also impact prospective rate negotiations.  New California Medicaid rates could be materially lower than prior payment rates particularly if counties look to limit payment rates to a cost-based methodology rather than a market-based negotiated rate.  We are awaiting formal guidance from California as to the manner in which this change will be implemented and whether the reimbursement method will change prospectively. Further, it is uncertain at this time whether and how counties will retroactively apply this change in method retroactively to December 12, 2023, given the previously negotiated payment terms. We are unable to predict with certainty the impact of this SPA at this time.  However, under some scenarios, the adverse financial impact could be material.\nAs disclosed herein, we receive a significant amount of Medicaid and Medicaid managed care revenue from both base payments and supplemental payments. Although we are unable to estimate the impact of the Managed Care Rule on our future results of operations, if implemented as proposed, Managed Care Rule related changes could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.\nFuture changes to the terms and conditions of the various programs outlined above could materially reduce our net benefit derived from the programs which could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. In addition, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.\nA 6.2% increase to the Medicaid Federal Matching Assistance Percentage (“FMAP”) was included in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. The CAA of 2023 provided for the transitional reduction of the 6.2% enhanced FMAP during 2023 to 5.0% during the second quarter, 2.5% during the third quarter and 1.5% during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nHITECH Act: \nIn July 2010, HHS published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American\n \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria. The implementation period for these Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate. Our acute care hospitals qualified for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use” criteria. The government’s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system.\nAll of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria. However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year. Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.\nIn the 2019 IPPS final rule, CMS overhauled the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program to focus on interoperability, improve flexibility, relieve burden and place emphasis on measures that require the electronic exchange of health information between providers and patients. We can provide no assurance that the changes will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nManaged Care: \nA significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance\n \norganizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs. In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to\n \n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ngrow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payers than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payers including managed care companies.\nCommercial Insurance: \nOur hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance. Private insurance carriers\n \ntypically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital’s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy. Private insurance reimbursement varies among payers and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payer.\nCommercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services. To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers’ reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.\nSurprise Billing Interim Final Rule: \nOn September 30, 2021, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury, along with the Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”), released an interim final rule with comment period, entitled “Requirements Related to Surprise Billing; Part II.” This rule is related to Title I (the “No Surprises Act”) of Division BB of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and establishes new protections from surprise billing and excessive cost sharing for consumers receiving health care items/services. It implements additional protections against surprise medical bills under the No Surprises Act, including provisions related to the independent dispute resolution (\"IDR\") process, good faith estimates for uninsured (or self-pay) individuals, the patient-provider dispute resolution process, and expanded rights to external review. On February 28, 2022, a district judge in the Eastern District of Texas invalidated portions of the rule governing aspects of the IDR process. In light of this decision, the government issued a final rule on August 19, 2022 eliminating the rebuttable presumption in favor of the qualifying payment amount by the IDR entity and providing additional factors the IDR entity should consider when choosing between two competing offers. CMS regulations and guidance implementing the IDR process has been subject to a significant amount of provider-initiated litigation. As a result, portions of those regulations and guidance materials have been vacated by a federal district court, causing CMS to, on several occasions, pause and resume IDR process operations, causing significant delay in the processing of claims. On October 27, 2023, HHS, the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury, and OPM issued a proposed rule intended to improve the functioning of the federal IDR process. Additionally, arguments made by the plaintiffs in such litigation have included allegations that CMS’s regulations and guidance materials are favorable to payers. We cannot predict the impact of the proposed rule on our operations at this time.\nOther Sources: \nOur hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. Such patients are evaluated, at the\n \ntime of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals’ indigent and charity care policy. Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.\nHealth Care Reform: \nListed below are the Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which have been, or are scheduled to be,\n \nimplemented as a result of the ACA.\nMedicaid Federal DSH Allotment\n:\nAlthough the implementation has been delayed several times, the ACA (as amended by subsequent federal legislation) requires annual aggregate reductions in federal Medicaid DSH allotment. Commencing in federal fiscal year 2026, and continuing through 2028, DSH payments are scheduled to be reduced by $8 billion annually. The American Relief Act, 2025 (HR 10545, Public Law No. 118-158) enacted into law on December 21, 2024 postponed the scheduled ACA Medicaid DSH cuts that were to take effect January 1, 2025 to April 1, 2025.  Subsequently H.R.1968 - Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025 enacted into law on March 15, 2024 further postponed the scheduled ACA Medicaid DSH cuts that were to take effect April 1, 2025 to October 1, 2025.\nValue-Based Purchasing:\nThere is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events. Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.\nThe ACA required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on October 1, 2012. The ACA requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years. HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality\n \n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nperformance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions. As part of the FFY 2022 IPPS final rule and FFY 2023 final rule, as discussed above, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS has implemented a budget neutral payment policy to fully offset the 2% VBP withhold during each of FFY 2022 and FFY 2023. In FFY 2024, as part of the FFY 2024 IPPS final rule, CMS removed the budget neutral policy that was in place in FFY 2022 and FFY 2023.\nHospital Acquired Conditions:\nThe ACA prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions (“HAC”). Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments. As part of the FFY 2023 final rule discussed above, and as a result of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, CMS suppressed all nine measures in the HAC Reduction Program for the FY 2023 program year and eliminated the HAC reduction program’s one percent payment penalty. In FFY 2024, as part of the FFY 2024 IPPS final rule, CMS eliminated the suppression of the applicable HAC measures and as a result reinstated the HAC reduction program.\nReadmission Reduction Program:\nIn the ACA, Congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program (“HRRP”). Hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard. The HRRP currently assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates for heart failure, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\"COPD\") and elective total hip arthroplasty (\"THA\") and/or total knee arthroplasty (\"TKA\"), excluding planned readmissions, when compared to expected rates. In the fiscal year 2015 IPPS final rule, CMS added readmissions for coronary artery bypass graft (\"CABG\") surgical procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017. To account for excess readmissions, an applicable hospital's base operating DRG payment amount is adjusted for each discharge occurring during the fiscal year. Readmissions payment adjustment factors can be no more than a 3% reduction. As part of the FFY 2023 IPPS final rule discussed above, CMS modified all of the condition-specific readmission measures to include an adjustment for patient history of COVID-19 for FFY 2024.\nAccountable Care Organizations:\nThe ACA requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations (“ACOs”). The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. CMS also developed and implemented more advanced ACO payment models that require ACOs to assume greater risk for attributed beneficiaries. Through various subsidiaries, we participate in ACOs in many of our acute care hospital markets.\nInfectious Disease Outbreaks, Pandemics, or Other Public Health Emergencies or Crisis\n \nOur business and financial results may be harmed by an international, national or localized outbreak of a highly contagious or epidemic disease, including but not limited to, COVID-19 or similar corona viruses, Ebola or Zika, may put stress on the capacity of all or a part of our health care facilities, could result in an abnormally high demand for health care services, require that resources be diverted from one part of operations to another part, or disrupt the supply chain for equipment and supplies necessary for operations. In addition, unaffected individuals may decide to defer elective procedures or otherwise avoid medical treatment, resulting in reduced patient volumes and operating revenues.\nIn addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare program and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities. The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers’ rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments. Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.\nFinally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results.\n \n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Operating Results\nInterest Expense:\n \nAs reflected on the schedule below, interest expense was $38 million and $45 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $114 million and $146 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively (amounts in thousands):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevolving credit facility (a.)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,541\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,729\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n9,027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,299\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranche A term loan, extinguished (a.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n36,157\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n113,934\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranche A term loan, 2029 (a.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17,093\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,055\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n51,281\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,055\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$800 million, 2.65% Senior Notes due 2030\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,356\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,356\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16,069\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16,069\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$700 million, 1.65% Senior Notes due 2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,932\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,932\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,795\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,794\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$500 million, 2.65% Senior Notes due 2032\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,345\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,345\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,035\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,035\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$500 million, 4.625% Senior Notes due 2029 (b.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,793\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n322\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17,376\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n322\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$500 million, 5.050% Senior Notes due 2034 (c.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,352\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n353\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19,056\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n353\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtotal-revolving credit, term loan A and Senior Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45,412\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n52,249\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n131,639\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n165,861\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization of financing fees\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,245\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,255\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,749\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,769\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther combined interest expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,476\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,869\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,670\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,713\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapitalized interest on major projects\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(9,516\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(10,345\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(24,265\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(27,922\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(186\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(368\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(942\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,036\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n38,431\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n44,660\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n113,851\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n146,385\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(a.)\nOn September 26, 2024, we entered into the tenth amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended and restated at various times from March, 2011 to June, 2022 (the \"Credit Agreement\"). The tenth amendment provided for, among other things, the following: (i) an extension of the maturity date to September 26, 2029; (ii) a $100 million increase in the revolving credit facility to $1.3 billion of aggregate borrowing capacity (which as of September 30, 2025, had $965 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity, net of $332 million of borrowings outstanding and $3 million of letters of credit), and; (iii) a $1.0 billion reduction in the outstanding borrowings pursuant to the tranche A term loan facility, to $1.2 billion from $2.2 billion previously, utilizing the proceeds generated from the September, 2024, issuance of the below-mentioned senior notes due in 2029 and 2034.\n(b.)\nIn September, 2024, we completed the offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due in 2029.\n(c.)\nIn September, 2024, we completed the offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.050% Senior Notes due in 2034.\nInterest expense decreased by $6 million, or 14%, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was due primarily to a net $7 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, term loan A and senior notes. The decrease resulted from a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities (3.97% during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to 4.70% during the comparable quarter of 2024), offset by an increase in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings pursuant to these facilities ($4.46 billion during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to $4.34 billion during the third quarter of 2024).\n \nInterest expense decreased by $33 million, or 22%, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was due primarily to a net $34 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, term loan A and senior notes. The decrease resulted from a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities (3.97% during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to 4.83% during the comparable period of 2024), as well as a decrease in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings pursuant to these facilities ($4.36 billion during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to $4.50 billion during the first nine months of 2024).\n \nThe average outstanding borrowings and the average effective interest rate, which includes amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, under our revolving credit, term loan A and senior notes, were approximately $4.46 billion and 4.1%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2025, and $4.34 billion and 4.8%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2024. The average outstanding borrowings and average effective interest rate on these facilities were approximately $4.36 billion and 4.1%, respectively, during the first nine months of 2025, and $4.50 billion and 5.0%, respectively, during the first nine months of 2024.\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCosts Related to Early Extinguishment of Debt During September, 2024:\nIn connection with the financing transactions completed in September, 2024, our results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, include a pre-tax charge of approximately $6 million incurred for the costs related to the extinguishment of debt consisting of the following: (i) approximately $3 million incurred to write-off deferred charges (included in other (income) expenses, net, on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income), and; (ii) approximately $3 million resulting from certain financing fees incurred during the third quarter of 2024 (included in other operating expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income).\n \nProvision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates:\nThe effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree months ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine months ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n117,781\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n75,623\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n327,354\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n233,563\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n496,886\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n341,533\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,390,699\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,059,625\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nThe provision for income taxes increased $42 million during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024, due primarily to: (i) the increase in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $156 million increase in pre-tax income (consisting of $155 million increase in income before income taxes and a $1 million favorable change in the income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interest), and; (ii) a $3 million increase in the provision for income taxes due to a decrease in the net benefit recorded in connection with ASU 2016-09 ($0.6 million net benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to $3.9 million during the third quarter of 2024). Excluding the impact of ASU 2019-09, our effective tax rates were 24.1% and 23.8% during the third quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nThe provision for income taxes increased $94 million during the first nine months of 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024, due primarily to: (i) the increase in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $327 million increase in pre-tax income (consisting of $331 million increase in income before income taxes and a $4 million unfavorable change in the income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interest), and; (ii) a $14 million increase in the provision for income taxes due to a decrease in the net benefit recorded in connection with ASU 2016-09 ($1.9 million net benefit recorded during the nine months of 2025 as compared to $15.5 million during the nine months of 2024).  Excluding the impact of ASU 2019-09, our effective tax rates were 24.0% and 23.9% during the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nDue to recent guidance and enacted laws surrounding the global 15% minimum tax rate that will be effective after 2024 from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") as well as jurisdictions that we operate in, we anticipate adverse effects to our provision for income taxes as well as cash taxes. We do not expect these adverse effects to be material and will continue to monitor changes in tax policies and laws issued by the OECD and jurisdictions that we operate in.\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiquidity\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.290 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 and $1.409 billion during the first nine months of 2024. The net decrease of $119 million was attributable to the following:\n•\na favorable change of $257 million resulting from an increase in net income plus/minus depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, losses/gains on sales of assets and businesses, and costs related to the extinguishment of debt;\n•\nan unfavorable change of $306 million in accounts receivable (which includes the above-mentioned $90 million of net reimbursements related to the Washington, D.C. Medicaid directed payment program recorded during the third quarter of 2025, which we expect to receive during the fourth quarter of 2025, and a combined increase of $48 million during the first nine months of 2025 related to two relatively recently opened hospitals in Las Vegas, NV, and Washington, D.C.);\n•\nan unfavorable change of $41 million in payments made in settlement of self-insurance claims, net of commercial insurance reimbursements;\n•\nan unfavorable change of $28 million in accrued and deferred income taxes;\n•\nan unfavorable change of $24 million in other assets and deferred charges, and;\n•\n$23 million of other combined net favorable changes. \nDays sales outstanding (“DSO”):\n Our DSO are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the nine-month periods. The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance at September 30th of each year to obtain the DSO. Our DSO were 55 days and 52 days at September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, we used $847 million of net cash in investing activities as follows:\n•\n$734 million spent on capital expenditures including costs related to a new acute care hospital being constructed in Florida and a replacement acute care facility in California, and capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities;\n•\n$49 million paid in connection with net cash outflows from forward exchange contracts that hedge our investment in the U.K. against movements in exchange rates; \n•\n$48 million spent on the acquisition of businesses and property;\n•\n$19 million paid in connection with the purchase and development of an enterprise resource planning application, and;\n•\n$3 million received from the sales of assets and businesses.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, we used $703 million of net cash in investing activities as follows:\n•\n$698 million spent on capital expenditures including capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities;\n•\n$36 million paid in connection with net cash outflows from forward exchange contracts that hedge our investment in the U.K. against movements in exchange rates, and;\n•\n$30 million received from the sales of assets and businesses.\nNet cash used in financing activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, we used $454 million of net cash in financing activities as follows:\n•\nspent $616 million to repurchase shares of our Class B Common Stock in connection with: (i) open market purchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program ($566 million), and; (ii) income tax withholding obligations related to stock-based compensation programs ($50 million);\n•\ngenerated $209 million of additional borrowings as follows: (i) $202 million pursuant to our revolving credit facility, and; (ii) $7 million related to other debt facilities; \n•\nspent $39 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.20 per share;\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nspent $28 million on net repayments of debt as follows: (i) $23 million related to our tranche A term loan facility, and; (ii) $5 million related to other debt facilities;\n•\nreceived $19 million from the sale of ownership interests to minority members;\n•\ngenerated $12 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans, and;\n•\nspent $10 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses;\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, we used $718 million of net cash in financing activities as follows:\n•\nspent $2.472 billion on net repayments of debt as follows: (i) $2.259 billion related to our previous tranche A term loan facility which was extinguished in September, 2024, and replaced with a new $1.2 billion tranche A term loan facility; (ii) $207 million related to our revolving credit facility, and; (iii) $6 million related to other debt facilities;\n•\ngenerated $2.210 billion of proceeds from additional borrowings as follows: (i) $1.200 billion related to our new tranche A term loan facility, as mentioned above; (ii) generated approximately $500 million of net proceeds (before expenses) related to the public offering, in September, 2024, of 4.625% senior secured notes due in 2029; (iii) generated approximately $498 million of net proceeds (before expenses) related to the public offering in September, 2024 of 5.050% senior secured notes due in 2034, and; (iv) $12 million of proceeds related to other debt facilities;\n•\nspent $421 million to repurchase shares of our Class B Common Stock in connection with: (i) open market purchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program ($349 million), and; (ii) income tax withholding obligations related to stock-based compensation programs ($72 million);\n•\nspent $40 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.20 per share;\n•\ngenerated $11 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans;\n•\nspent $10 million to pay financing costs;\n•\nreceived $9 million from the sale of ownership interests to minority members, and;\n•\nspent $6 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses.\nExpected capital expenditures during remainder of 2025\nDuring the full year of 2025, we expect to spend approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion on capital expenditures which includes expenditures for capital equipment, construction of new facilities, and renovations and expansions at existing hospitals. During the first nine months of 2025 we spent approximately $734 million on capital expenditures and expect to spend approximately $266 million to $366 million during the remainder of 2025.\nWe believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed below.\nCapital Resources\nCredit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities\nIn September 2024, we entered into a tenth amendment (\"Tenth Amendment\") to our credit agreement (\"Credit Agreement\"), dated as of November 15, 2010, as amended and restated at various times from March, 2011 to June, 2022, among UHS, as borrower, the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto, as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The Tenth Amendment provided for: (i) an extension of the maturity date to September 26, 2029; (ii) a new revolving credit facility of up to $1.3 billion (which as of September 30, 2025, had $965 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity, net of $332 million of outstanding borrowings and $3 million of letters of credit), and; (iii) a new replacement tranche A term loan facility (\"Tranche A Term Loan\") of up to $1.2 billion (which had $1.17 billion of outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2025).\nPursuant to the terms of the Tenth Amendment, the Tranche A Term Loan provides for installment payments of $7.5 million per quarter commencing on December 31, 2024 through September 30, 2026, and $15.0 million per quarter commencing on December 31, 2026 through June 30, 2029. The unpaid principal balance at June 30, 2029 (scheduled to be $975.0 million) is payable on the September 26, 2029 scheduled maturity date of the Credit Agreement.\nRevolving credit and Tranche A Term Loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at our election at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the lender’s prime rate, (b) the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month term SOFR rate plus 1.1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.25% to 0.625%, or (2) the one,\n \n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthree or six month term SOFR rate plus 0.1% (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.25% to 1.625%. As of September 30, 2025, the applicable margins were 0.25% for ABR-based loans and 1.25% for SOFR-based loans under the revolving credit and term loan A facilities.  The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries (which generally excludes asset classes such as substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals, if sold to a receivables facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and certain real estate assets and assets held in joint-ventures with third parties) and is guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.\nThe Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens, indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, dividends and stock repurchases; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage. We were in compliance with all required covenants as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had combined aggregate principal of $3.0 billion from the following senior secured notes:\n•\n$700 million of aggregate principal amount of 1.65% senior secured notes due in September, 2026 (\"2026 Notes\") which were issued on August 24, 2021. Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable on March 1st and September 1st until the maturity date of September 1, 2026.\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior secured notes due in October, 2029 (\"2029 Notes\") which were issued on September 26, 2024. Interest on the 2029 Notes is payable on April 15th and October 15th, commencing April 15, 2025 until the maturity date of October 15, 2029.\n•\n$800 million of aggregate principal amount of 2.65% senior secured notes due in October, 2030 (\"2030 Notes\") which were issued on September 21, 2020. Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable on April 15th and October 15th, until the maturity date of October 15, 2030.\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of 2.65% senior secured notes due in January, 2032 (\"2032 Notes\") which were issued on August 24, 2021. Interest on the 2032 Notes is payable on January 15th and July 15th until the maturity date of January 15, 2032.\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.050% senior secured notes due in October, 2034 (\"2034 Notes\") which were issued on September 26, 2024. Interest on the 2034 Notes is payable on April 15th and October 15th, commencing on April 15, 2025 until the maturity date of October 15, 2034.\nThe 2026, 2029, 2030, 2032 and 2034 Notes (collectively \"All the Notes\") are guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) on a senior secured basis by all of our existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries that guarantee our Credit Agreement, other first lien obligations, or any junior lien obligations (the \"Subsidiary Guarantors\").  All the Notes and the Guarantees are secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on certain of the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ assets now owned or acquired in the future by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors (other than real property, accounts receivable sold pursuant to a Company-related receivables facility (as defined in the Indenture pursuant to which All the Notes were issued (the “Indentures”), and certain other excluded assets). The Company’s obligations with respect to All the Notes, the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Guarantees, and the performance of all of the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ other obligations under the Indentures, are secured equally and ratably with the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ obligations under the Credit Agreement. However, the liens on the collateral securing All the Notes and the Guarantees will be released if: (i) All the Notes have investment grade ratings; (ii) no default has occurred and is continuing, and; (iii) the liens on the collateral securing all first lien obligations (including the Credit Agreement and All the Notes) and any junior lien obligations are released or the collateral under the Credit Agreement, any other first lien obligations and any junior lien obligations is released or no longer required to be pledged. The liens on any collateral securing All the Notes and the Guarantees will also be released if the liens on that collateral securing the Credit Agreement, other first lien obligations and any junior lien obligations are released.\nIn connection with an asset purchase and sale agreement, and related lease agreements, completed with Universal Health Realty Income Trust (\"Trust\") in December 2021, our consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 reflect financial liabilities, which are included in debt, of approximately $71 million and $74 million, respectively. In connection with that transaction, as a result of our purchase option within the lease agreements related to two of our facilities, the asset purchase and sale transaction was accounted for as a failed sale leaseback in accordance with U.S. GAAP and we have accounted for the transaction as a financing arrangement. Our lease payments payable to the Trust are recorded to interest expense and as a reduction of the outstanding financial liability, and the amount allocated to interest expense is determined based upon our incremental borrowing rate and the outstanding financial liability.\nAt September 30, 2025, the carrying value and fair value of our debt were approximately $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value and fair value of our debt were approximately $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions. We consider these to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments.\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was approximately 40% as of both September 30, 2025 and  December 31, 2024.\nWe expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility, which had $965 million of available borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2025, or through refinancing the existing Credit Agreement; (ii) the issuance of other short-term and/or long-term debt, and/or; (iii) the issuance of equity. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available commitments under existing agreements, as well as access to the capital markets, provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months. However, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had combined aggregate principal of $3.0 billion from All the Notes:\n•\n$700 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes;\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes;\n•\n$800 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes;\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2032 Notes, and;\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2034 Notes.\nAll the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed pursuant to the Guarantees on a senior secured basis by the Subsidiary Guarantors.  All the Notes and the Guarantees are secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on certain of the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ assets now owned or acquired in the future by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors (other than real property, accounts receivable sold pursuant to the Company’s existing receivables facility (as defined in the Indentures pursuant to which All the Notes were issued ), and certain other excluded assets). The Company’s obligations with respect to All the Notes, the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Guarantees, and the performance of all of the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ other obligations under the Indentures, are secured equally and ratably with the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ obligations under the Credit Agreement. However, the liens on the collateral securing All the Notes and the Guarantees will be released if: (i) All the Notes have investment grade ratings; (ii) no default has occurred and is continuing, and; (iii) the liens on the collateral securing all first lien obligations (including the Credit Agreement and All the Notes) and any junior lien obligations are released or the collateral under the Credit Agreement, any other first lien obligations and any junior lien obligations is released or no longer required to be pledged. The liens on any collateral securing All the Notes and the Guarantees will also be released if the liens on that collateral securing the Credit Agreement, other first lien obligations and any junior lien obligations are released.\nAll the Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of our existing and future subsidiaries that are not and do not become Subsidiary Guarantors of All the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the collateral has been made, and the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. Consequently, liquidating the collateral securing All the Notes may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on All the Notes.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although our Credit Agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and our Credit Agreement and All the Notes contain restrictions on our ability to incur liens to secure additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, if we incur any additional indebtedness secured by liens that rank equally with All the Notes, subject to collateral arrangements, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with holders of All the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our company. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to holders of All the Notes.\nFederal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of All the Notes and the incurrence of the Guarantees. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, All the Notes or the Guarantees (or the grant of collateral securing any such obligations) could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if we or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, as applicable, (a) issued All the Notes or incurred the Guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (b) under certain circumstances received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing All the Notes or incurring the Guarantees.\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBasis of Presentation\nThe following tables include summarized financial information of Universal Health Services, Inc. and the other obligors in respect of debt issued by Universal Health Services, Inc. The summarized financial information of each obligor group is presented on a combined basis with balances and transactions within the obligor group eliminated.

Such collateral securities are secured equally and ratably with our and the Guarantors’ obligations under our Credit Agreement. For a list of our subsidiaries the capital stock of which has been pledged to secure All the Notes, see Exhibit 22.1 to this Report.\nUpon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the indentures governing All the Notes, subject to the terms of the Security Agreement relating to All the Notes provide for (among other available remedies) the foreclosure upon and sale of the Collateral (including the pledged stock) and the distribution of the net proceeds of any such sale to the holders of All the Notes, the lenders under the Credit Agreement and the holders of any other permitted first priority secured obligations on a pro rata basis, subject to any prior liens on the collateral.\nNo appraisal of the value of the collateral securities has been made, and the value of the collateral securities in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. Consequently, liquidating the collateral securities securing All the Notes may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on All the Notes.\nThe security agreement relating to All the Notes provides that the representative of the lenders under our Credit Agreement will initially control actions with respect to that collateral and, consequently, exercise of any right, remedy or power with respect to enforcing interests in or realizing upon such collateral will initially be at the direction of the representative of the lenders.\nNo trading market exists for the capital stock pledged as collateral.\nThe assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial information of Universal Health Services, Inc.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025 there have been no material changes in the off-balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds.\nAs of September 30, 2025 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled $177 million consisting of: (i) $156 million related to our self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $21 million of other debt and public utility guarantees.\n \n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nItem 3.\n \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThere have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

  "item2": "Item 2.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and A\nnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nAs of September 30, 2025, we owned and/or operated 374 inpatient facilities and 156 outpatient and other facilities located in 39 states, Washington, D.C., the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. We have changed the method of our outpatient behavioral health care facility counts during the third quarter of 2025 and substantially all of the increase from prior periods relates to that change in convention.\n \nOur facilities include the following:\n \nAcute care facilities located in the U.S.:\n•\n29 inpatient acute care hospitals;\n•\n34 free-standing emergency departments, and;\n•\n10 outpatient centers & 1 surgical hospital.\nBehavioral health care facilities (345 inpatient facilities and 111 outpatient facilities):\n \nLocated in the U.S.:\n•\n182 inpatient behavioral health care facilities, and;\n•\n102 outpatient behavioral health care facilities. \nLocated in the U.K.:\n•\n160 inpatient behavioral health care facilities, and;\n•\n2 outpatient behavioral health care facilities.\nLocated in Puerto Rico:\n•\n3 inpatient behavioral health care facilities.\n•\n7 outpatient behavioral health care facilities.\nNet revenues from our acute care hospitals, outpatient facilities and commercial health insurer accounted for 59% and 57% of our consolidated net revenues during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 57% of our consolidated net revenues during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\n \nNet revenues from our behavioral health care facilities and commercial health insurer accounted for 41% and 43% of our consolidated net revenues during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 43% our consolidated net revenues during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nOur behavioral health care facilities located in the U.K. generated net revenues of approximately $264 million and $230 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $738 million and $651 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Total assets at our U.K. behavioral health care facilities were approximately $1.532 billion as of September 30, 2025 and $1.358 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nServices provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.\nForward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors\nYou should carefully review the information contained in this Quarterly Report and should particularly consider any risk factors that we set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, this Quarterly Report and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). In this Quarterly Report, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. This Quarterly Report contains “forward-looking statements” that reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning our possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will or will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, and statements of our goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “appears,” “projects” and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense,\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nidentify forward-looking statements.  In evaluating those statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks related to healthcare industry trends and those set forth in \nPart 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors \nand \nPart II,\n \nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors \nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and in \nPart II, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part I, Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors, \nas\n \nincluded herein. Those factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any of our forward-looking statements.\n \nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or our good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control.  Many factors, including those set forth herein in \nItem 1A. Risk Factors \nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024,\n \nand other important factors disclosed in this Quarterly Report, and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Such factors include, among other things, the following:\n•\nas discussed below in \nSources of Revenue, \nwe receive revenues from various state and county-based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate. We receive annual Medicaid revenues of approximately $100 million, or greater, from each of Texas, California, Nevada, Washington, D.C., Illinois, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Florida, Mississippi and Washington. Most of these programs are approved on a year-to-year basis and there is no assurance that these revenues will continue at their current rates or at all. We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state-based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states; \n•\nlegislation adopted on July 4, 2025 (the One Big Beautiful Bill Act), attaches work and community service requirements to eligibility for Medicaid benefits that will have the effect of limiting Medicaid enrollment and expenditure. That legislation also places limits on provider fees used to increase federal Medicaid funding to states. The legislation prohibits states not previously having expanded Medicaid eligibility to 138% of federal poverty level from increasing the rate of current provider fees which fund certain state supplemental payments or increasing the base of the fee to a class or items of services that the fee did not previously cover. That current provider fee threshold will remain at 6%.  For states having expanded Medicaid eligibility under the legislation, the provider fee threshold will be reduced by 0.5% annually between federal fiscal years 2028 and 2032 with the resulting threshold ultimately becoming 3.5%. The legislation also eliminates certain insurance exchange premium tax credits beyond 2025 and exchange enrollment is expected to be adversely impacted. Extension of the tax credits is currently the subject of United States Congressional debate as part of the federal budget negotiation, and we cannot predict whether these subsidies will ultimately be adopted in federal fiscal year 2026. All of these factors, which could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, may be expected to reduce our revenue and likely increase the level of uncompensated care provided by our facilities;  \n•\nthere are additional legislative changes that are likely to result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or state level. For example, Congress has reduced to $0 the penalty for failing to maintain health coverage that was part of the original Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA\") as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Biden administration had issued executive orders implementing a special enrollment period permitting individuals to enroll in health plans outside of the annual open enrollment period and reexamining policies that may undermine the ACA or the Medicaid program. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was passed on August 16, 2022, which among other things, allows for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") to negotiate prices for certain single-source drugs reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. The American Rescue Plan Act’s expansion of subsidies to purchase coverage through an ACA exchange, which the IRA continued through 2025, has increased exchange enrollment.  However, the Trump administration has already taken steps to undo these Biden-era initiatives, including adopting legislation eliminating certain exchange premium tax credits; \n•\nthere have been numerous political and legal efforts to expand, repeal, replace or modify the ACA since its enactment, some of which have been successful, in part, in modifying the ACA, as well as court challenges to the constitutionality of the legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court held in \nCalifornia v. Texas\n that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the legislation’s requirement to obtain minimum essential health insurance coverage, or the individual mandate.  The Court dismissed the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. The legislation faced its most recent challenge when the Supreme Court, in the June 2025 \nKennedy v.\n \nBraidwood Management \ndecision, opined in favor of ACA HIV preventive care coverage. The impacts of this decision cannot be predicted. Any future efforts to challenge, replace or replace the ACA or expand or substantially amend its provision is unknown.  See below in \nSources of Revenues and Health Care Reform \nfor additional disclosure;\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nadditional possible unfavorable changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by third party payers or government based payers, including Medicare or Medicaid in the United States, and government based payers in the United Kingdom;\n•\nthe healthcare industry is labor intensive and salaries, wages and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures, as are supplies expense and other operating expenses. In the past, staffing shortages have, at times, required us to hire expensive temporary personnel and/or enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel. At certain facilities, particularly within our behavioral health care segment, there have been occasions when we were unable to fill all vacant positions and, consequently, we were required to limit patient volumes. We have also experienced general inflationary cost increases related to certain of our other operating expenses. Many of these factors, which had a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations in prior years, have moderated more recently. However, we cannot predict future inflationary increases, which if significant, could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations.  We have experienced inflationary pressures, primarily in personnel costs, although those pressures have moderated more recently. The extent of any future impacts from inflation on our business and our results of operations will be dependent upon how long the elevated inflation levels persist and the extent to which the rate of inflation further increases, if at all, neither of which we are able to predict. If elevated levels of inflation were to persist or if the rate of inflation were to accelerate, our expenses could increase faster than anticipated and we may utilize our capital resources sooner than expected. Further, given the complexities of the reimbursement landscape in which we operate, our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws, which in certain circumstances, limit our ability to increase prices;\n•\nin our acute care segment, we have experienced a significant increase in hospital based physician related expenses, especially in the areas of emergency room care, anesthesiology and radiology. We have implemented various initiatives to mitigate the increased expense, to the degree possible, which has moderated the rate of increase.  However, significant increases in these physician related expenses could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations;\n•\nthe increase in interest rates during the past few years has increased our interest expense significantly increasing our expenses and reducing our free cash flow and our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms. As such, the effects of increased borrowing rates have adversely impacted our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict future changes to interest rates, however, significant increases in our borrowing rates could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations;\n•\nsignificant tariffs or other restrictions, if imposed on our imported pharmaceutical ingredients, medical devices, medical equipment and their ingredients and components, could escalate costs of medications, medical devices and medical equipment and disrupt our supply chains. While we continue to evaluate the potential impact of the new tariffs on our business, given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of any new tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the U.S. and the impacted foreign countries, we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful. Therefore, changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular, increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from where our products or materials are made (either directly or through our suppliers) could have an impact on our competitive position, business operations and financial results;       \n•\nthe Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025 extended appropriations to federal agencies for continuing projects and activities through September 30, 2025. In the past several years political disputes concerning authorization of a federal budget have led to shutdown of substantial portions of the federal government and other federal budget authorization delays have occurred. Currently, the United States Congress has failed to approve a federal budget for federal fiscal year 2026 and a federal shutdown began on October 1, 2025. Federal budget delays and federal government shutdowns are unpredictable and may occur in the future. We cannot predict whether or not there will be future legislation halting a federal government shutdown, however, our operating cash flows and results of operations could be materially unfavorably impacted by the federal government shutdown;\n•\nas part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the \"CAA\"), Congress passed legislation aimed at preventing or limiting patient balance billing in certain circumstances. The CAA addresses surprise medical bills stemming from emergency services, out-of-network ancillary providers at in-network facilities, and air ambulance carriers. The CAA prohibits surprise billing when out-of-network emergency services or out-of-network services at an in-network facility are provided, unless informed consent is received.  In these circumstances providers are prohibited from billing the patient for any amounts that exceed in-network cost-sharing requirements. HHS, the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury have issued rules to implement the legislation. The rules have limited the ability of our hospital-based physicians to receive payments for services at usually higher out-of-network rates in certain circumstances, and, as a result, have caused us to increase subsidies to these physicians or to replace their services at a higher cost level;\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nin June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo \nand \nRelentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce\n, which modified the regulatory interpretation standard established 40 years ago by \nChevron v. National Resources Defense Council\n. \nChevron\n doctrine generally required courts to defer to federal agencies in their interpretation of federal statutes when a statute was silent or ambiguous with respect to a specific issue.  In \nLoper Bright\n, the Supreme Court held that courts are no longer required to grant such deference, though they may consider an agency’s statutory interpretation. As it is highly regulated, the health care industry could be significantly impacted by the \nLoper Bright\n decision, particularly in the areas of Medicare reimbursement, decision making by the Food & Drug Administration and health care fraud and abuse compliance, where parties may no longer be able to rely on federal agencies’ policies, rules and guidance;\n•\nour ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the ability of our competitors to do the same; \n•\nthe impact of a shift of care from inpatient to lower cost outpatient settings and controls designed to reduce inpatient services;\n•\nthe outcome of known and unknown litigation, government investigations, inquiries, false claims act allegations, and liabilities and other claims asserted against us and other matters, and the effects of adverse publicity relating to such matters, as disclosed in\n Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies, \nincluding, but not limited to, the jury verdict returned against Cumberland Hospital for Children and Adolescents located in New Kent, Virginia, an indirect subsidiary of ours, and the verdict in the Pinnacle litigation in Washoe County, Nevada, against certain subsidiaries of ours;   \n•\neffective March, 2025, our excess commercial insurance coverage for professional and general liability claims contains less favorable terms than previous years including coverage exclusions for incidents involving sexual molestation or abuse, higher premiums and lower aggregate limitations; \n•\ncompetition from other healthcare providers (including physician owned facilities) in certain markets;\n•\ntechnological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing, or reduce the demand for healthcare;\n•\nour ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals and the impact on our labor and related expenses resulting from a shortage of nurses, physicians and other healthcare professionals;\n•\ndemographic changes;\n•\nthere is a heightened risk of future cybersecurity threats, including ransomware attacks targeting healthcare providers. If successful, future cyberattacks could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any costs that we incur as a result of a data security incident or breach, including costs to update our security protocols to mitigate such an incident or breach could be significant. Any breach or failure in our operational security systems, or any third-party security systems that we rely on, can result in loss of data or an unauthorized disclosure of or access to sensitive or confidential member or protected personal or health information and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, significant penalties or fines, litigation, loss of customers, significant damage to our reputation and business, and other liability or losses. We may also incur additional costs related to cybersecurity risk management and remediation. There can be no assurance that we or our service providers, if applicable, will not suffer losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all the costs resulting from such events;\n•\nthe availability of suitable acquisition and divestiture opportunities and our ability to successfully integrate and improve our acquisitions since failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits from certain of our prior or future acquisitions could result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangibles;\n•\nthe impact of severe weather conditions, including the effects of hurricanes, flash floods, wildfires and climate change;\n•\nour ability to continue to obtain capital on acceptable terms, including borrowed funds, to fund the future growth of our business;\n•\nour inpatient acute care and behavioral health care facilities may experience decreasing admission and length of stay trends;\n•\nour financial statements reflect large amounts due from various commercial and private payers and there can be no assurance that failure of the payers to remit amounts due to us will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations;\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nthe Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “2011 Act”) imposed annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the “Joint Committee”), which was tasked with making recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. Current legislation has extended these reductions through 2032.  We cannot predict whether Congress will restructure the implemented Medicare payment reductions or what other federal budget deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress going forward;\n•\nuninsured and self-pay patients treated at our acute care facilities unfavorably impact our ability to satisfactorily and timely collect our self-pay patient accounts;\n•\nchanges in our business strategies or development plans;\n•\nwe have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the pound sterling. We have international subsidiaries that operate in the United Kingdom.  We routinely hedge our exposures to foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations, but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations. To the extent that these hedges are inadequate, our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses, and;\n•\nother factors referenced herein or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nGiven these uncertainties, risks and assumptions, as outlined above, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

In the past, staffing shortages have, at times, required us to hire expensive temporary personnel and/or enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other clinical staff and support personnel. At certain facilities, particularly within our behavioral health care segment, there have been occasions when we were unable to fill all vacant positions and, consequently, we were required to limit patient volumes. We have also experienced general inflationary cost increases related to certain of our other operating expenses. Many of these factors, which had a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations in prior years, have moderated more recently. However, we cannot predict future inflationary increases, which if significant, could have a material unfavorable impact on our future results of operations.\nWe have experienced inflationary pressures, primarily in personnel costs, although those pressures have moderated more recently. The extent of any future impacts from inflation on our business and our results of operations will be dependent upon how long the elevated inflation levels persist and the extent to which the rate of inflation further increases, if at all, neither of which we are able to predict. If elevated levels of inflation were to persist or if the rate of inflation were to accelerate, our expenses could increase faster than anticipated and we may utilize our capital resources sooner than expected. Further, given the complexities of the reimbursement landscape in which we operate, our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited due to various federal, state and local laws, which in certain circumstances, limit our ability to increase prices.\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLegislation adopted on July 4, 2025 attaches work and community service requirements to eligibility for Medicaid benefits that will have the effect of limiting Medicaid enrollment and expenditures and the legislation also places limits on provider taxes used to increase federal Medicaid funding to states.  In addition, insurance exchange subsidies are scheduled to expire later this year which could unfavorably impact insurance exchange enrollment. Extension of these subsidies is currently the subject of Congressional debate as part of the federal budget negotiation, and we cannot predict whether these subsidies will ultimately be adopted in federal fiscal year 2026. As these provisions become effective over the next several years, they may be expected to reduce our revenues and likely increase the level of uncompensated care provided by our facilities. Please see \nSources of Revenue \nbelow\n \nfor additional disclosure related to Medicaid supplemental payment programs in various states in which we operate.\n \nSignificant tariffs or other restrictions, if imposed on our imported pharmaceutical ingredients, medical devices, medical equipment and their ingredients and components, could escalate costs of medications, medical devices and medical equipment and disrupt our supply chains. While we continue to evaluate the potential impact of the new tariffs on our business, given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of any new tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs or trade barriers by the U.S. and the impacted foreign countries, we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful. Therefore, changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular, increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from where our products or materials are made (either directly or through our suppliers) could have an impact on our competitive position, business operations and financial results.\n \nAlthough our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing healthcare to Medicare and Medicaid patients is limited, as discussed above, we have been requesting and negotiating increased rates from commercial insurers to defray our increased cost of providing patient care. In addition, we have implemented various productivity enhancement programs and cost reduction initiatives including, but not limited to, the following: team-based patient care initiatives designed to optimize the level of patient care services provided by our licensed nurses/clinicians; efforts to reduce utilization of, and rates paid for, premium pay labor; consolidation of medical supply vendors to increase purchasing discounts; review and reduction of clinical variation in connection with the utilization of medical supplies, and; various other efforts to increase productivity and/or reduce costs including investments in new information technology applications.\nFinancial results for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and is used in the discussion below for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% of Net\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% of Net\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,495,245\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,963,027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating charges:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,071,898\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,912,308\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n48.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther operating expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,294,721\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,090,197\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplies expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n414,583\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n390,250\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n155,060\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n149,567\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLease and rental expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37,295\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n36,540\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtotal-operating expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,973,557\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n88.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,578,862\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n90.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome from operations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n521,688\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n384,165\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n38,431\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44,660\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther (income) expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(13,629\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.3\n\n\n)%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2,028\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.1\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n496,886\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n341,533\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n117,781\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n75,623\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n379,105\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n265,910\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,148\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,196\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to UHS\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n372,957\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n258,714\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues increased by 13.4%, or $532 million, to $4.495 billion during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $3.963 billion during the third quarter of 2024. The net increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $431 million, or 11.3%, increase in net revenues generated from our acute care hospital services and behavioral health services operated during both periods (which we refer to as “Same Facility”), and; (ii) an other combined net increase of $101 million, consisting primarily of $58 million of combined net revenues generated during the third quarter of 2025 at two newly constructed acute care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada (West Henderson Hospital which opened during the fourth quarter of 2024), and Washington, D.C.

This increase was primarily attributable to:\n•\na $155 million increase in income before income taxes, as discussed above;\n•\na decrease of $42 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from: (i) the increase in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $155 million increase in income before income taxes, and; (ii) a $3 million increase in the provision for income taxes due to a decrease in the net benefit recorded in connection with \"ASU 2016-09\", Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, net of the impact of executive compensation limitations pursuant to IRC section 162(m) ($0.6 million net benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to $3.9 million during the third quarter of 2024).\nFinancial results for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and is used in the discussion below for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% of Net\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmount\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% of Net\nRevenues\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12,878,781\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n11,714,213\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating charges:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,037,953\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,611,304\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n47.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther operating expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,563,039\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,165,483\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplies expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,236,249\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,181,886\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n455,409\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n438,050\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLease and rental expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n109,348\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n108,165\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtotal-operating expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,401,998\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n88.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,504,888\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n89.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome from operations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,476,783\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,209,325\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n113,851\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n146,385\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther (income) expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(27,767\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.2\n\n\n)%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,315\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,390,699\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,059,625\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n327,354\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n233,563\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,063,345\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n826,062\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20,490\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16,362\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income attributable to UHS\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,042,855\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n809,700\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues increased by 9.9%, or $1.165 billion, to $12.879 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $11.714 billion during the first nine months of 2024. The net increase was primarily attributable to: (i) a $974 million, or 8.6%, increase in net revenues generated from our acute care hospital services and behavioral health services, on a Same Facility basis, and; (ii) an other combined net increase of $191 million consisting primarily of $128 million of combined net revenues generated during the first nine months of 2025 at two newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals, as mentioned above.\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIncome before income taxes (before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased by $331 million, or 31%, to $1.391 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 as compared to $1.060 billion during the first nine months of 2024. The net increase was due to:\n•\nan increase of $169 million at our acute care facilities, as discussed below in \nAcute Care Hospital Services\n;\n•\nan increase of $82 million at our behavioral health care facilities, as discussed below in \nBehavioral Health Care Services\n;\n•\nan increase of $33 million from a decrease in interest expense, as discussed below in \nOther Operating Results-Interest Expense\n;\n•\nan increase of $20 million from an increase in the market value of certain equity securities, and; \n•\n$27 million of other combined net increases.\nNet income attributable to UHS increased by $233 million, or 29%, to $1.043 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $810 million during the first nine months of 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to:\n•\na $331 million increase in income before income taxes, as discussed above;\n•\na decrease of $94 million resulting from an increase in the provision for income taxes resulting primarily from: (i) the increase in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $331 million increase in income before income taxes, and; (ii) a $14 million increase in the provision for income taxes due to a decrease in the net benefit recorded in connection with ASU 2016-09 ($1.9 million net benefit recorded during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to $15.5 million during the first nine months of 2024).\nAdjustments to self-insured professional and general liability reserves:\nOur estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including, among other things, the number of asserted claims and reported incidents, estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts, estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience, and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies.\n \nAs a result of unfavorable trends experienced, included in our results of operations were increases to our reserves for self-insured professional and general liability claims amounting to $35 million during each of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025, and $30 million and $44 million during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Approximately $22 million of the increase is included in our same facility basis acute care hospital services' results during each of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025, respectively, and approximately $13 million is included in our same facility basis behavioral health services' results during each of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025, respectively. Approximately $23 million and $33 million of the increase is included in our same facility basis acute care hospital services' results during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and approximately $7 million and $11 million is included in our same facility basis behavioral health services' results during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n \nAcute Care Hospital Services\nThe following table sets forth certain operating statistics for our acute care hospital services for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSame Facility Basis\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAll\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSame Facility Basis\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAll\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage licensed beds\n\n\n \n\n\n6,869\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,797\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,161\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,797\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,798\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,735\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,043\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,735\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage available beds\n\n\n \n\n\n6,697\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,625\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,989\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,625\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,626\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,563\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,871\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,563\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient days\n\n\n \n\n\n401,148\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n401,479\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n412,353\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n401,479\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,216,788\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,212,669\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,243,297\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,212,669\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage daily census\n\n\n \n\n\n4,360.3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,363.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,482.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,363.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,457.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,425.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,554.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,425.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy-licensed beds\n\n\n \n\n\n63.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n62.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n65.6\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n65.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n65.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy-available beds\n\n\n \n\n\n65.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n65.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n65.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n66.3\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67.4\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmissions\n\n\n \n\n\n84,368\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n83,149\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n86,984\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n83,149\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n254,141\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n249,474\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n260,459\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n249,474\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLength of stay\n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAcute Care Hospital Services-Same Facility Basis\nWe believe that providing our results on a “Same Facility” basis (which is a non-GAAP measure), which includes the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance. Our Same Facility results also neutralize (if applicable) the effect of items that are non-operational in nature\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nincluding items such as, but not limited to, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived and intangible assets and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.\nOur Same Facility basis results reflected on the table below also exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below \nSources of Revenue-Summary of Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs.\n However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under \nAll Acute Care Hospital Services\n. The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses. Prior year amounts related to certain facilities previously included in our Behavioral Health Care Services’ results have been reclassified into our Acute Care Hospital Services' results as of May 1, 2024 to conform with current year presentation. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance, the Same Facility results should be examined in connection with our net income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a Same Facility basis and is used in the discussion below for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollar amounts in

periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nDuring the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, net revenues from our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, increased by $277 million or 12.8%. The increase included approximately $68 million representing the Same Facility basis, acute care hospital services' portion of the $90 million aggregate benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2025 in connection with the Washington, D.C., Medicaid state directed payment program, covering the period of October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025, as mentioned above.\n \nIncome before income taxes (and before income attributable to noncontrolling interests) increased by $133 million, or 65%, amounting to $339 million, or 13.9% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to $206 million, or 9.5% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2024. The increase included the above-mentioned $68 million benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2025 in connection with the Washington, D.C., Medicaid state directed payment program, covering the period of October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025.\n \nDuring the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, net revenue per adjusted admission increased by 9.8% while net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 11.5%, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter, inpatient admissions to our acute care hospitals increased by 1.5% while adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased by 2.0%. Patient days at these facilities decreased by 0.1% and adjusted patient days increased by 0.4% during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.8 days during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 65% and 66% during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOn a Same Facility basis, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $41 million, or 4.6%. Contributing to the increase in salaries, wages and benefits was an increase in our patient volumes during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024. As a percentage of net revenues, salaries, wages and benefits expense decreased to 38.6% during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to 41.7% during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther operating expenses increased by $95 million, or 15.8%, during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2025. Operating expenses incurred by our commercial health insurer, consisting primarily of medical costs, increased by $45 million, or 35.8% (due to a corresponding increase in membership), during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024. Excluding the operating costs of our commercial insurer from each period, other operating expenses increased by $49 million, or 10.4%. Contributing to the increased operating expenses during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024, was a $21 million, or 13.3%, aggregate increase in physician expenses incurred at certain hospitals. As a percentage of net revenues, other operating expenses increased to 28.6% during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to 27.8% during the comparable quarter of 2024.\nSupplies expense increased by $12 million, or 3.5%, during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the third quarter of 2024, due, in part, to an increase in patient volumes. As a percentage of net revenues, supplies expense decreased to 14.2% during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to 15.4% during the third quarter of 2024.\nNine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable prior year period, net revenues from our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, increased by $580 million or 9.1%.

The average length of inpatient stay at these facilities was 4.8 days and 4.9 days during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The occupancy rate, based on the average available beds at these facilities, was 67% during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\n \nOn a Same Facility basis, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $122 million, or 4.7%. Contributing to the increase in salaries, wages and benefits was an increase in our patient volumes during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the comparable period of 2024. As a percentage of net revenues, salaries, wages and benefits expense decreased to 39.4% during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to 41.1% during the first nine months of 2024.\nOther operating expenses increased by $214 million, or 12.2%, during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to the comparable period of 2025.

(ii) an other combined net increase of $99 million consisting primarily of $58 million of combined net revenues generated during the third quarter of 2025 at two newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals, as mentioned above, and a $40 million increase in provider tax assessments (which had no impact on income before income taxes since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses).\n \nIncome before income taxes increased by $99 million, or 49%, to $300 million, or 11.4% of net revenues during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to $201 million, or 8.9% of net revenues during the comparable quarter of 2024. The increase resulted primarily from: (i) the $133 million, or 65%, increase in income before income taxes from our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, as discussed above, partially offset by; (ii) a $19 million pre-tax loss incurred during the third quarter of 2025 at the recently completed and opened Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center, and; (iii) an $18 million legal reserve established during the third quarter of 2025 in connection with the verdict in the Pinnacle litigation in Washoe County, Nevada, against certain subsidiaries of ours, as disclosed in\n Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and Contingencies.\n \n \nDuring the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $74 million, or 8.3%. The increase was due primarily to the above-mentioned $41 million, or 4.6%, increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, as well as the salaries, wages and benefits expense incurred at the two above-mentioned newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals.\n \nOther operating expenses increased by $178 million, or 25.4%, during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024.  The increase was due primarily to: (i) the $95 million above-mentioned increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis; (ii) a $40 million increase in provider tax assessments; (iii) a combined increase of $26 million in operating expenses incurred at the two above-mentioned newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals, and; (iv) the above-mentioned $18 million legal reserve established during the third quarter of 2025 in connection with the verdict in the Pinnacle litigation in Washoe County, Nevada, against certain subsidiaries of ours.\n \nSupplies expense increased by $22 million, or 6.5%, during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024.

The increase resulted primarily from: (i) the $237 million, or 38%, increase in income before income taxes from our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, as discussed above, partially offset by; (ii) a $47 million pre-tax loss incurred during the first nine months of 2025 at Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center, and; (iii) an $18 million legal reserve established during the third quarter of 2025 in connection with the verdict in the Pinnacle litigation in Washoe County, Nevada, against certain subsidiaries of ours.\n \nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024, salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $201 million, or 7.7%. The increase was due primarily to the above-mentioned $122 million increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, as well as the salaries, wages and benefits expense incurred at the two above-mentioned newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals.\nOther operating expenses increased by $340 million, or 16.9%, during the first nine months of 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024. The increase was due to: (i) the $214 million above-mentioned increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis; (ii) a $50 million increase in provider tax assessments; (iii) a combined increase of $58 million in operating expenses incurred at the two above-mentioned newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals, and; (iv) the above-mentioned $18 million legal reserve established during the third quarter of 2025 in connection with the verdict in the Pinnacle litigation in Washoe County, Nevada, against certain subsidiaries of ours.\n \nSupplies expense increased by $52 million, or 5.2%, during the first nine months of 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024. The increase was due to the above-mentioned $28 million increase related to our acute care hospital services, on a Same Facility basis, as well as the supplies expense incurred at the two above-mentioned newly constructed and recently opened acute care hospitals.\n \nCharity Care and Uninsured Discounts:\nThe following tables show the amounts recorded at our acute care hospitals for charity care and uninsured discounts, based on charges at established rates, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\nUncompensated care:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmounts in millions\n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months Ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharity\n \ncare\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n348\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n227\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n834\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n644\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUninsured discounts\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n716\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n705\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n76\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,103\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n72\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,925\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal uncompensated care\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,064\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n932\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,937\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,569\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nEstimated cost of providing uncompensated care:\nThe estimated costs of providing uncompensated care as reflected below were based on a calculation which multiplied the percentage of operating expenses for our acute care hospitals to gross charges for those hospitals by the above-mentioned total uncompensated care amounts.

Our Same Facility results also neutralize (if applicable) the effect of items that are non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, impacts of settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived and intangible assets and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods.\nOur Same Facility basis results reflected on the table below also excludes from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period as discussed below \nSources of Revenue-Summary of Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs.\n However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table below under \nAll Behavioral Health Care Services\n. The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the tables below since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses. Prior year amounts related to certain facilities previously included in our Behavioral Health Care Services’ results have been reclassified into our Acute Care Hospital Services' results as of May 1, 2024 to conform with current year presentation. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance, the Same Facility results should be examined in connection with our net income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for our behavioral health care facilities, on a Same Facility basis, and is used in the discussions below for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollar amounts in

The increase was due primarily to the above-mentioned $62 million, or 6.6%, increase related to our behavioral health facilities, on a Same Facility basis, as well as $24 million of other combined net increases consisting primarily of increased provider tax assessments.\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSupplies expense increased by $2 million, or 1.1%, during the first nine months of 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024.\n \nSources of Revenue\nOverview:\n We receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients.\nHospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or behavioral health) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control. The percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis, as well as increased pressure from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services, where possible, on a less expensive outpatient basis. We believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues.\nPatients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, some private insurance plans, and managed care plans, but are responsible for services not covered by such plans, exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has generally been increasing each year. Indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers which unfavorably impacts the collectability of our patient accounts.\nSources of Revenues and Health Care Reform:\n Given increasing budget deficits, the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of Medicare and Medicaid funding, which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals. In addition, the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of, among other things, economic recovery stimulus packages, responses to natural disasters, and the federal and state budget deficits in general may affect the availability of government funds to provide additional relief in the future. Changes resulting from the outcome of the 2024 elections and subsequent legislative and administrative initiatives have included increased scrutiny of Medicare Advantage programs, work requirements for Medicaid waiver program eligibility, increased focus on hospital outpatient site neutral payment policies, and similar initiatives that may reduce the availability of funding for federal healthcare programs or make eligibility for benefits more difficult. Legislation adopted on July 4, 2025 will have the effect of substantially decreasing federal funding for state Medicaid Programs. Any significant reduction in federal Medicaid funding to states would likely result in states reducing Medicaid payments to us which would have a material adverse effect on us. We are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations.\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”) was enacted and its two primary goals were to provide for increased access to coverage for healthcare and to reduce healthcare-related expenses. The ACA revised reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to emphasize the efficient delivery of high-quality care and contains a number of incentives and penalties under these programs to achieve these goals. The ACA provides for reductions to Medicaid DSH payments which are scheduled to begin in FFY 2026.\nA 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling limited the federal government’s ability to expand health insurance coverage by holding unconstitutional sections of the ACA that sought to withdraw federal funding for state noncompliance with certain Medicaid coverage requirements. Pursuant to that decision, the federal government may not penalize states that choose not to participate in the Medicaid expansion by reducing their existing Medicaid funding. Therefore, states can choose to expand or not to expand their Medicaid program without risking the loss of federal Medicaid funding. As a result, many states, including Texas, have not expanded their Medicaid programs without the threat of loss of federal funding. CMS has previously granted section 1115 demonstration waivers providing for work and community engagement requirements for certain Medicaid eligible individuals. CMS has also released guidance to states interested in receiving their Medicaid funding through a block grant mechanism. The Biden administration withdrew certain previously issued section 1115 demonstrations aligned with these policies, but Georgia had imposed work and community engagement requirements under a Medicaid demonstration program that launched July 1, 2023. President Trump, more favorable to work and community engagement requirements in his first administration, sought and obtained legislative work and community engagement applicable to a significant percentage of Medicaid program beneficiaries. We anticipate this change will lead to reductions in Medicaid coverage and likely increases in uncompensated care.\n \nOn December 14, 2018, a Texas Federal District Court deemed the ACA to be unconstitutional in its entirety. The Court concluded that the ACA mandate that individuals maintain coverage was no longer permissible under Congress’s taxing power as a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 reducing the individual mandate’s tax to $0 (i.e., it no longer produces revenue, which is an essential feature of a tax). The Court also held that because the individual mandate is “essential” to the ACA and is inseverable from the rest of\n \n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthe law, the entire ACA is unconstitutional. That ruling was ultimately appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which decided in \nCalifornia v. Texas\n that the plaintiffs in the matter lacked standing to bring their constitutionality claims.  The Court did not reach the plaintiffs’ merits arguments, which specifically challenged the constitutionality of the ACA's individual mandate and the entirety of the ACA itself. As a result, the ACA will continue to be law, and the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") and its respective agencies will continue to enforce regulations implementing the law. However, on September 7, 2022, the ACA faced its most recent challenge when a Texas Federal District Court judge, in the case of \nBraidwood Management v. Becerra\n, ruled that a requirement that certain health plans cover services without cost sharing violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution and that the coverage of certain HIV prevention medication violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The decision was ultimately appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which opined in favor of the ACA HIV prevention coverage. The impact of this litigation cannot be predicted.\nThe ACA also contained provisions aimed at reducing fraud and abuse in healthcare. The ACA amends several existing laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers. While Congress had previously revised the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person is not required to “have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of” the Anti-Kickback Statute in order to be found in violation of such law, the ACA also provides that any claims for items or services that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are also considered false claims for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The ACA provides that a healthcare provider that retains an overpayment in excess of 60 days is subject to the federal civil False Claims Act. In December, 2024, CMS changed the standard for identification of an overpayment and now requires the report and return of an overpayment if a provider or supplier has actual knowledge of the existence of an overpayment or acts in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of an overpayment. The ACA also expanded the Recovery Audit Contractor program to Medicaid. These amendments also make it easier for severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.\nWe have partnered with local physicians in the ownership of certain of our facilities. These investments have been permitted under an exception to the physician self-referral law. The ACA permits existing physician investments in a hospital to continue under a “grandfather” clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital. The ACA also imposes certain compliance and disclosure requirements upon existing physician-owned hospitals and restricts the ability of physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their facilities. A repeal of the ACA, in whole or in relevant part, may result in physicians being able to expand ownership interest in hospitals.\nIn addition to legislative changes, the ACA can be significantly impacted by executive branch actions. The Biden administration had issued executive orders implementing a special enrollment period permitting individuals to enroll in health plans outside of the annual open enrollment period and reexamining policies that may undermine the ACA or the Medicaid program. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021's expansion of subsidies to purchase coverage through an exchange contributed to increased exchange enrollment in 2021. The IRA’s extension of subsidies through 2025 increased exchange enrollment in years sequent to 2021. However, the Trump administration has already taken steps to undo these Biden-era initiatives, including those intended to increase ACA exchange and Medicaid enrollment.\nIt remains unclear what portions of the ACA may remain, or whether any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation.  Any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally, and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by our hospitals.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation will not have a negative financial impact on our hospitals, including their ability to compete with alternative healthcare services funded by such potential legislation, or for our hospitals to receive payment for services. Extension of these subsidies is currently the subject of Congressional debate as part of the federal budget negotiation, and we cannot predict whether these subsidies will ultimately be adopted in federal fiscal year 2026.\nFor additional disclosure related to our revenues including a disaggregation of our consolidated net revenues by major source for each of the periods presented herein, please see \nNote 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Revenue Recognition\n.\nMedicare:\n Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. All of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities. Amounts received under the Medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. Since a substantial portion of our revenues will come from patients under the Medicare program, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in this program.\nUnder the Medicare program, for inpatient services, our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge. The fixed payment amount is based upon each patient’s Medicare severity diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Every MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. The MS-DRG payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nactual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. The MS-DRG and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity. While we generally will not receive payment from Medicare for inpatient services, other than the MS-DRG payment, a hospital may qualify for an “outlier” payment if a particular patient’s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold. MS-DRG rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,” gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. Generally, however, the percentage increases in the MS-DRG payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals.\nIn July, 2025, CMS published its IPPS 2026 final payment rule which provides for a 3.3% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments, and adjustments mandated by the Legislation are considered (including a -0.7% productivity adjustment offset), without consideration for the required Medicare DSH payments changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments is approximately 1.0%.  Instead of applying a state-level rural floor budget neutrality adjustment to the wage index, the final rule has applied a uniform, national budget neutrality adjustment to the FY 2026 wage index for the rural floor. Nevada will be subject to a 5.0% reduction in the wage index adjustment as a result of a decrease in the wage index rural floor in that state. Including DSH payments, a decrease to the Medicare Outlier threshold and certain other adjustments, we estimate our overall increase from the final IPPS 2026 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2025 through September 30, 2026) will approximate 2.7%.\nIn August, 2024, CMS published its IPPS 2025 final payment rule which provides for a 2.9% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates, documenting and coding adjustments, and adjustments mandated by the ACA are considered, without consideration for the required Medicare DSH payments changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments is approximately 1.8%. Including DSH payments, an increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold and certain other adjustments, we estimate our overall increase from the final IPPS 2025 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025) will approximate 1.2%.\nIn August, 2023, CMS published its IPPS 2024 final payment rule which provides for a 3.1% market basket increase to the base Medicare MS-DRG blended rate. When statutorily mandated budget neutrality factors, annual geographic wage index updates (including a change in the Medicare Rural Floor calculation), documenting and coding adjustments, and adjustments mandated by the ACA are considered, without consideration for the required Medicare DSH payments changes and increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold, the overall increase in IPPS payments is approximately 6.6%. Including DSH payments, an increase to the Medicare Outlier threshold and certain other adjustments, our overall increase from the final IPPS 2024 rule (covering the period of October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024) was approximately 5.4%.\nIn June, 2019, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a decision favorable to hospitals impacting prior year Medicare DSH payments (\nAzar v. Allina Health Services\n, No. 17-1484 (U.S. Jun. 3, 2019)).  In \nAllina\n, the hospitals challenged the Medicare DSH adjustments for federal fiscal year 2012, specifically challenging CMS’s decision to include inpatient hospital days attributable to Medicare Part C enrollee patients in the numerator and denominator of the Medicare/SSI fraction used to calculate a hospital’s DSH payments.  This ruling addresses CMS’s attempts to impose the policy espoused in its vacated 2004 rulemaking to a fiscal year in the 2004–2013 time period without using notice-and-comment rulemaking. This decision should require CMS to recalculate hospitals’ DSH Medicare/SSI fractions, with Medicare Part C days excluded, for at least federal fiscal year 2012, but likely federal fiscal years 2005 through 2013. In June, 2023, CMS issued a rule to retroactively negate the effects of the aforementioned Supreme Court decision. Although we can provide no assurance that we will ultimately receive additional funds, we estimate that the court ruling and final impacts on prior year hospital Medicare DSH payments range between $18 million to $28 million in the aggregate.\nThe 2011 Act included the imposition of annual spending limits for most federal agencies and programs aimed at reducing budget deficits by $917 billion between 2012 and 2021, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office. Among its other provisions, the law established a bipartisan Congressional committee, known as the Joint Committee, which was responsible for developing recommendations aimed at reducing future federal budget deficits by an additional $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The Joint Committee was unable to reach an agreement by the November 23, 2011 deadline and, as a result, across-the-board cuts to discretionary, national defense and Medicare spending were implemented on March 1, 2013 resulting in Medicare payment reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year. Subsequent legislation has extended this sequestration through 2032.  The CARES Act, as amended, temporarily suspended or limited the application of this sequestration from May 1, 2020 through June 30, 2022, with a return to the full 2% Medicare payment reduction thereafter.\nInpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the Medicare program are paid under a Psychiatric Prospective Payment System (“Psych PPS”). Medicare payments to psychiatric hospitals are based on a prospective per diem rate with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics. The Psych PPS also contains provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department.\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn August, 2025, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2026. Under this final rule, payments to our behavioral health care hospitals and units from the market basket update are estimated to increase by 2.5% compared to federal fiscal year 2025. This amount includes the effect of the 3.2% net market basket update which reflects the offset of a 0.7% productivity adjustment. When all of the final patient level adjustments described below as well as proposed wage index values are considered, we estimate that Psych PPS payments will increase by 1.7% in FFY 2026.\nIn July, 2024, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2025. Under this final rule, payments to our behavioral health care hospitals and units from the market basket update are estimated to increase by 2.8% compared to federal fiscal year 2024. This amount includes the effect of the 3.3% net market basket update which reflects the offset of a 0.5% productivity adjustment. When all of the final patient level adjustments described below as well as proposed wage index values are considered, we estimate that Psych PPS payments will increase by 2.1% in FFY 2025.\nIn addition to the market basket update noted above, CMS made the following changes:\n•\nRevisions to the methodology for determining the payment rates under the Inpatient Psychiatric Facility (\"IPF\") PPS for psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units based on a review of the data and information collected in prior years in accordance with section 1886(s)(5)(A) of the Social Security Act, as added by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (\"CAA of 2023\"). CMS finalized revisions to the IPF patient-level adjustment factors. The patient-level adjustments include Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS–DRGs) assignment of the patient’s principal diagnosis, selected comorbidities, patient age, and the variable per diem adjustments;\n•\nImplement these revisions in a budget-neutral manner (that is, estimated payments to IPFs for FFY 2025 would be the same with or without the final revisions), and;\n•\nClarified the criteria regarding all-inclusive cost reporting. This clarification requires our behavioral health care hospitals, which are currently utilizing an all-inclusive charging practice, to modify both their billing practices and information technology applications by June 1, 2025 to ensure compliance with future regulations. We intend to be in compliance with this CMS billing requirement.\nThis final rule also includes two requests for information on future revisions to the IPF PPS facility-level adjustment factors and development of the new standardized IPF Patient Assessment Instrument, required by the CAA of 2023, which IPFs participating in the IPF Quality Reporting Program will be required to report for Rate Year 2028.\nIn July, 2023, CMS published its Psych PPS final rule for the federal fiscal year 2024. Under this final rule, payments to our behavioral health care hospitals and units increased by approximately 3.3% compared to federal fiscal year 2023. This amount includes the effect of the 3.5% net market basket update which reflects the offset of a 0.2% productivity adjustment.\nIn July, 2025, CMS issued its OPPS proposed rule for 2026. The hospital market basket increase is 3.2% and the productivity adjustment reduction is 0.8% for a net market basket increase of 2.4%. When other statutorily required adjustments (including a 1.95% reduction for the 340B remedy discussed below) and hospital patient service mix are considered, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2026 will aggregate to a net increase of 0.1%.\nSome key changes in the 2026 OPPS proposed rule include:\n \n340B Remedy Recoupment:\nCMS is proposing to shorten the 340B Remedy recoupment transition from 16 years to 5 years. A 2023 CMS final rule had implemented a negative OPPS recoupment adjustment of 0.5 percent for approximately 16 years to offset $7.8 billion paid to hospitals for non-drug OPPS payments between 2018 and 2022 – following the US Supreme Court decision overturning the Trump Administration’s 340B reduction policy.  CMS now proposes to increase the annual offset of 0.5 percent to 2 percent effective CY 2026 and to remain in effect until the estimated payment reduction reaches $7.8 billion, which CMS estimates will occur in CY 2031.\n \nEliminating the Inpatient Only (IPO) List:\n \nCMS is proposing to phase out the IPO list over a 3-year period, beginning with removing 285 mostly musculoskeletal procedures for CY 2026.  Procedures removed from the IPO list would be exempted from certain medical review activities related to the two-midnight policy for CY 2026 and subsequent years until CMS determines the service or procedure is more commonly performed in the Medicare population in the outpatient setting. We are unable to estimate the potential financial impact of this proposal.\n \nOn November 2, 2023, in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in \nAmerican Hospital Association v. Becerra\n (142 S. Ct. 1896 (2022)) and the district court’s remand to the agency, CMS issued a final rule outlining the remedy for the 340B-acquired drug payment policy for calendar years 2018-2022. CMS published the final rule to remedy the payment rates the Court held were invalid aspects of their past policy and will affect nearly all hospitals paid under the OPPS.  As part of the final remedy, CMS will make an adjustment to the update factor to maintain budget neutrality as required by statute. CMS finalized the 340B policy for calendar year 2018 in 2017 in a budget neutral manner that included increasing payments for non-drug items and services; this payment increase was in effect from calendar years 2018 through 2022. CMS estimates that hospitals were paid $7.8 billion more for non-drug items and services during\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthis time period than they would have been paid in the absence of the 340B payment policy.  Because CMS is now making additional payments to affected 340B covered entity hospitals to pay them what they would have been paid had the 340B policy never been implemented, CMS will make a corresponding offset to maintain budget neutrality as if the 340B payment policy had never been in effect. To carry out this required $7.8 billion budget neutrality adjustment, CMS will reduce future non-drug item and service payments by adjusting the OPPS conversion factor by minus 0.5% starting in calendar year 2026 and continuing for 16 years. As discussed above, as noted in the 2026 OPPS proposed rule, CMS is proposing to shorten the recovery period of the $7.8 billion from 17 years to 5 years starting in calendar year 2026 with a 2.0% reduction to non-drug item and service payments.\nThe estimated impact of this 2.0% reduction on our projected 2026 results of operations related to both Medicare and Medicare Advantage is approximately $13 million.\nIn November, 2024, CMS issued its OPPS final rule for 2025. The hospital market basket increase is 3.4% and the productivity adjustment reduction is 0.5% for a net market basket increase of 2.9%. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, including a 14.2% increase to the partial hospitalization rate, we estimate that our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2025 will aggregate to a net increase of 3.6%.\nIn November, 2023, CMS issued its OPPS final rule for 2024. The hospital market basket increase is 3.3% and the productivity adjustment reduction is 0.2% for a net market basket increase of 3.1%. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2024 aggregated to a net increase of approximately 9.7%. This percentage reflects the impact resulting from rural floor changes to the Medicare wage index adjustment factor where certain states, such as California and Nevada, will materially benefit from this change.\nIn November, 2022, CMS issued its OPPS final rule for 2023. The hospital market basket increase is 4.1% and the productivity adjustment reduction is -0.3% for a net market basket increase of 3.8%.  The final rule provides that in light of the Supreme Court decision in \nAmerican Hospital Association v. Becerra\n, CMS applied the default rate, generally average sales price plus 6%, to 340B acquired drugs and biologicals for 2023.  During the 2018-2022 time period, we recorded an aggregate of approximately $45 million to $50 million of Medicare revenues related to the prior 340B payment policy. When other statutorily required adjustments and hospital patient service mix are considered, as well as impact of the aforementioned 340B Program policy change, our overall Medicare OPPS update for 2023 aggregated to a net increase of approximately 0.9% which includes a 0.3% increase to behavioral health division partial hospitalization rates.\nIn November, 2019, CMS finalized its Hospital Price Transparency rule that implements certain requirements under the June 24, 2019 Presidential Executive Order related to Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First. Under this final rule, effective January 1, 2021, CMS will require: hospitals to make public: (1) their standard changes (both gross charges and payer-specific negotiated charges) for all items and services online in a machine-readable format, and; (2) standard charge data for a limited set of “shoppable services” the hospital provides in a form and manner that is more consumer friendly. On November 2, 2021, CMS released a final rule increasing the monetary penalty that CMS can impose on hospitals that fail to comply with the price transparency requirements. We believe that our hospitals are in full compliance with the applicable federal regulations. In November, 2023, CMS finalized multiple provisions, effective as of January 1, 2024, focused on increasing hospital price transparency and compliance enforcement including but not limited to: (1) standard charges data would be posted online using a CMS template, instead of using the hospital’s own form/format; (2) all standard charge information would be encoded with a specified set of data elements (e.g., hospital name; license number; payer/plan name; description of service; billing codes, among others); (3) other technical changes related to increasing consumers’ automated accessibility to hospital standard charges, and; (4) certifications regarding accuracy of standard charge data and related compliance warning notices from CMS and requiring accessibility to health system leadership regarding transparency noncompliance.\nIn September, 2024, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and the Treasury published final rules that:\n•\nMandate that insurers analyze the outcomes of their coverage to ensure there's equivalent access to mental health care, including provider networks, prior authorization rates and payment for out-of-network providers, and take action to get in compliance;\n•\nEstablish when health plans can’t use prior authorization or other tactics to make it more difficult to access mental health and substance use treatment, and;\n•\nRequire additional insurers to comply with the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act.\nWhile these rules will likely improve patient access to inpatient and outpatient mental health services, we are unable to estimate the related potential impact on our results of operations.\nMedicaid:\n Medicaid is a joint federal-state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS-like system, or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital’s customary charges for services provided. In addition to revenues received pursuant to the Medicare program, we receive a large\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nportion of our revenues either directly from Medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing Medicaid. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.\nWe receive revenues from various state and county-based programs, including Medicaid in all the states in which we operate. We receive annual Medicaid revenues of approximately $100 million, or greater, from each of Texas, California, Nevada, Washington, D.C., Illinois, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Florida, Mississippi and Washington.  We also receive Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in certain states including, most significantly, Texas. Many of these programs have a Medicaid supplemental payment component that are subject to approval on a year-to-year basis and there is no assurance that these supplemental payment revenues will continue at their current rates or at all. We are therefore particularly sensitive to potential reductions in Medicaid and other state-based revenue programs as well as regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive changes in those states. We can provide no assurance that reductions to revenues earned pursuant to these programs, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nThe ACA substantially increases the federally and state-funded Medicaid insurance program, and authorizes states to establish federally subsidized non-Medicaid health plans for low-income residents not eligible for Medicaid starting in 2014. However, the Supreme Court has struck down portions of the ACA requiring states to expand their Medicaid programs in exchange for increased federal funding. Accordingly, many states in which we operate have not expanded Medicaid coverage to individuals at 133% of the federal poverty level. Facilities in states not opting to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA may be additionally penalized by corresponding reductions to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments beginning in fiscal year 2024, as discussed below. We can provide no assurance that further reductions to Medicaid revenues, particularly in the above-mentioned states, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nSummary of Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs:\nThe following table summarizes the revenues, healthcare provider taxes (“Provider Taxes”) and net benefit related to each of the below-mentioned Medicaid supplemental programs for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.  The Provider Taxes are recorded in other operating expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as included herein. The \"Projected Full Year 2025\" amounts reflected on the table below are, in many cases, subject to federal and potentially state approval and may be affected by any reductions or other changes in

our acute care hospitals located in various counties of Texas participate in Medicaid supplemental payment Section 1115 Waiver indigent care programs. The 1115 Waiver has been approved by CMS through September 30, 2030. These hospitals also have affiliation agreements with third-party hospitals to provide free hospital and physician care to qualifying indigent residents of these counties. Our hospitals receive both supplemental payments from the Medicaid program and indigent care payments from third-party, affiliated hospitals. The supplemental payments are contingent on the county or hospital district making an Inter-Governmental Transfer (“IGT”) to the state Medicaid program while the indigent care payment is contingent on a transfer of funds from the applicable affiliated hospitals. However, the county or hospital district is prohibited from entering into an agreement to condition any IGT on the amount of any private hospital’s indigent care obligation.\nCHIRP (including QIF)\nOn August 1, 2022, CMS approved the Comprehensive Hospital Increase Reimbursement Program (\"CHIRP\"), with a pool of $5.2 billion, for the rate period effective September 1, 2022 to August 31, 2023. On July 31, 2023, CMS approved the CHIRP program, with a pool of $6.5 billion, for the rate period of September 1, 2023 to August 31, 2024. On September 13, 2024, CMS approved the CHIRP program with a pool of $6.5 billion for the rate period September 1, 2024 to August 31, 2025 (with an amended CMS approval\n \n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\non October 1, 2024). A CHIRP preprint for the rate period September 1, 2025 to August 31, 2026 was approved by CMS in August, 2025 with a pool size of $9.2 billion. This program is estimated to increase reimbursement to our hospitals by approximately $20 million to $23 million in program year 2026.\nOn January 26, 2024, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (\"THHSC\") issued a final rule that will modify the CHIRP payments beginning with the State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2025 rate period to promote the advancement of the quality goals and strategies the program is designed to advance.\nThe final modifications include:\n•\nCreation of a new pay-for-performance incentive payment through a third component in CHIRP, the Alternate Participating Hospital Reimbursement for Improving Quality Award (\"APHRIQA\"). For state fiscal years beginning with SFY 2025, behavioral health hospitals and rural hospitals will not be included in the pay-for-performance program, and;.\n•\nThe funds for payment of the APHRIQA component will be transitioned from the existing uniform rate increase components of the Uniform Hospital Rate Increase Percentage and the Average Commercial Incentive Award and will be paid using a scorecard that directs managed care organizations to pay providers for performance achievements on quality outcome measures. Payments will be distributed under APHRIQA on a semi-annual basis that aligns with the measurement period determined for quality metrics reporting.\nCHIRP payment levels could be reduced materially if our hospitals are not able meet the required APHRIQA pay-for-performance metrics.  The Company’s hospitals in this program have met 100% of the applicable APHRIQA pay-for-performance metrics for SFY 2025.\nIn connection with the Quality Incentive Fund (“QIF”), the results of operations of certain of our acute care hospitals located in Texas included $21 million and $36 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. QIF revenues are earned pursuant to contract terms with various Medicaid managed care plans which requires the annual payout of QIF funds when a managed care service delivery area’s actual claims-based CHIRP payments are less than targeted CHIRP payments for a specific rate year.\nWe estimate that these hospitals will be entitled to approximately $32 million of aggregate QIF revenues during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nUC\n Included in these provider tax programs are reimbursements received in connection with the Texas Uncompensated Care program (\"UC\"). The size and distribution of the UC pool are determined based on charity care costs reported to THHSC in accordance with Medicare cost report Worksheet S-10 principles.\nHARP\nOn September 24, 2021, THHSC finalized New Fee-for-Service Supplemental Payment Program: Hospital Augmented Reimbursement Program (“HARP”) to be effective October 1, 2021. The HARP program continues the financial transition for providers who have historically participated in the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment program described below. The program, which was approved by CMS on August 15, 2023, will provide additional funding to hospitals to help offset the cost hospitals incur while providing Medicaid services. HARP is technically a Medicaid Upper Payment Limit as payment under this program is based on a reasonable estimate of the amount that would be paid for the services under Medicare payment principles but is referred to as HARP by THHSC.\n \nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $6 million and $7 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively and, approximately $18 million and $21 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe expect our net reimbursements pursuant to HARP to approximate $24 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nNevada State Directed Payment Program (\"SDP\"):\nAs previously reported, in February, 2023, the Nevada Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (“DHCFP”) outlined a new provider fee on private hospitals located in Nevada that would effectively capture new Medicaid federal share for certain categories of services eligible for the new payment program. In late December, 2023, CMS approved the Medicaid managed care component of the Nevada SDP program, with an effective date of January 1, 2024. In November 2024, CMS approved an increased assessment rate which funded an increase in the SDP pool size covering the period of July 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. Payments made pursuant to this component of the Nevada SDP program, which requires annual approval by CMS, are subject to reconciliation by DHCFP based on actual Medicaid managed care utilization during 2024. There can be no assurance that the Medicaid managed care component of the Nevada SDP will continue for any period after December 31, 2025, or that it will not be modified.\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $58 million and $42 million during the\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthree-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively and, approximately $171 million and $121 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nThe Nevada SDP for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025 has been approved by CMS. We estimate that our aggregate net reimbursements pursuant to both components of the Nevada SDP program (net of related provider taxes) will approximate $229 million during the year ended December 31, 2025. The DCHFP submitted a revised SDP preprint for the period January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025. If approved as submitted, we estimate that the aggregate net benefit applicable to our facilities could increase by approximately $30 million covering the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025. This incremental increase to the Nevada SDP program is not reflected in the above Medicaid Supplemental Provider Tax table.\n \nVarious Other State Programs:\nWe receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental Medicaid payment programs. The states include, but are not limited to, the state programs listed below from which we receive significant reimbursements.\nKentucky Hospital Rate Increase Program (“HRIP”)\nIn early 2021, CMS approved the Kentucky Medicaid Managed Care Hospital Rate Increase Program. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $21 million and $19 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively and, approximately $64 million and $61 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.  In December, 2024, CMS approved the program for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025 at rates comparable to the prior year.\n \nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to HRIP will approximate $90 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nCalifornia Supplemental Payments\nIn California, the state continues to operate Medicaid supplemental payment programs consisting of three components: Fee For Service Payment, Managed Care-Pass-Through Payment and Managed Care-Directed Payment. The non-federal share for these programs are financed by a statewide provider tax. The Directed Payment method will be based on actual concurrent hospital Medicaid managed care in-network patient volume whereas the other programs are based on prior year Medicaid utilization. The CMS program approval status is outlined in the table below.\nCalifornia Hospital Fee Program CMS Approval Status\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHospital Fee Program Component\n\n\nCMS Methodology Approval\n\n\nCMS Rate Setting Approval Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStatus\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFee For Service Payment\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2024\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2024; Paid through December 31, 2024\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaged Care-Pass-Through Payment\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2024\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2022 and paid in advance through December 31, 2024\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaged Care-Directed Payment\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2024\n\n\nApproved through December 31, 2022 and paid in advance through December 31, 2023\n \n\n\n\n\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $21 million and $8 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and approximately $53 million and $34 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. During the first quarter of 2025, the Department of Health Care Services submitted a final draft of the Hospital Quality Assurance Fee program 9 fee to CMS for approval for the period January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 and a subsequent amendment in July 2025.  This submission includes the Managed Care-Directed Payment preprint.  We are unable to predict the outcome, amount or timing of any related increase that may result from this submission.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $68 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nMississippi Hospital Access Program\nIn September, 2023, subject to CMS approval, Mississippi announced a $689 million, two-part Medicaid payment proposal, effective retroactively to July 1, 2023, that would be funded by annual hospital assessments to the state's Medicaid program. These hospital assessments are calculated using a formula provided under state law. The first part of the program, known as the Mississippi Hospital Access Program (“MHAP”), provides direct payments for hospitals that serve patients in the state's Medicaid managed care delivery system. Hospitals are reimbursed near the average commercial rate, which is the upper limit (\"UPL\") for Medicaid managed care\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nreimbursements. The second part of the program supplements traditional Medicaid payment rates for hospitals providing inpatient and outpatient services up to Medicaid's regulated UPL. In September 2025, CMS approved the MHAP program component for the period July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026. The UPL component was approved in April 2024.\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $11 million during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and approximately $40 million and $38 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to these supplemental payment programs will approximate $51 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nFlorida Medicaid Managed Care Directed Payment Program (“DPP”) and Low Income Payment (“LIP”)\nThe Florida DPP provides for an additional payment for Medicaid managed care contracted services. The LIP program provides payment for hospital uncompensated care under the 1115 Medicaid Waiver.  For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 no revenue was recorded in connection with the DPP program (substantially all of this DPP revenue is recorded during the fourth quarters of each year).  In connection with the LIP program, $2 million and $12 million of net reimbursements (net of provider taxes) were recorded during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025, respectively.\nWe estimate that our reimbursements pursuant to this DPP and LIP will approximate $57 million during the year ended December 31, 2025. The Florida DPP for the period of October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025 is under CMS' review for approval. The submitted DPP preprint includes a request to increase the size of the program and related DPP add-on payment levels based on a percentage of average commercial rates. If approved as submitted, we estimate that the aggregate net benefit applicable to our facilities could increase by approximately $47 million on an annual basis.  This incremental increase to the Florida DPP program is not reflected in the above Medicaid Supplemental Provider Tax table.\nIllinois Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs\nThe Illinois Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs are comprised of three components: (1) Medicaid managed care directed payment program; (2) Medicaid managed care pass-through program, and; (3) Medicaid fee for service supplemental payment program. These programs require various related legislative and regulatory approvals each year.\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $9 million during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and approximately $27 million and $28 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to these supplemental payment programs will approximate $32 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.  CMS approval of these programs for the period of January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 occurred in September 2025.\nIndiana Medicaid Managed Care DPP\nThe Indiana DPP provides for an additional payment for Medicaid managed care contracted services. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $8 million during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and approximately $24 million during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. CMS has approved this program through September 30, 2025.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $33 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nOklahoma (Transition to Managed Care and Implementation of a Medicaid Managed Care DPP)\nThe current Oklahoma Medicaid supplemental payment program in effect, prior to the planned implementation of the new DPP in 2024, is the Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program (“SHOPP”). The SHOPP component will remain in place for certain categories of Medicaid patients that will continue to be enrolled in the traditional Medicaid Fee for Service program.\nIn May, 2022, Oklahoma enacted legislation that directs the Oklahoma Health Care Authority (\"OHCA\") to: (i) transition its Medicaid program from a fee for service payment model to a managed care payment model by no later than October 1, 2023, and: (ii) concurrently implement a Medicaid managed care DPP using a managed care gap of 90% of average commercial rates. In December, 2022, the OHCA delayed the implementation date of the Medicaid managed care change and related DPP until April 1, 2024.  In September, 2023, CMS approved the DPP program for the 15-month period effective as of April 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025.  CMS approval of the DPP program for the period July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026 is pending.\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $7 million and $6 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and approximately $19 million and $14 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to these two supplemental payment programs (i.e. SHOPP and DPP) will approximate $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nSouth Carolina Health Access, Workforce and Quality (“HAWQ”) Program\nIn September 2023, CMS approved the South Carolina HAWQ Program retroactive to July 1, 2023 and subsequently approved by CMS in July, 2024 for the period of July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025. This program is a Medicaid managed care directed payment program that provides for a rate enhancement to Medicaid managed care encounters. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $4 million and $9 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and approximately $23 million and $19 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $29 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nMichigan Directed Payment Program (“DPP”)\nIn March 2024, CMS approved the Michigan Medicaid DPP retroactive to October 1, 2023 based on average commercial rates. The Michigan DPP provides for an additional payment for Medicaid managed care contracted services. In connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $13 million and $9 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and approximately $35 million and $29 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $47 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.  The Michigan DPP for the period of October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025 was approved by CMS.\nIdaho Upper Payment Limit (“UPL”)\nIn April 2024, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (“IDHW”) released its updated Medicaid UPL calculation for SFY 2024 (July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024) and revised its SFY 2023 (July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023) UPL calculation. Subject to CMS approval, the IDHW plans to continue this UPL program through SFY 2025 (July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025) at payment levels comparable to SFY 2024. In SFY 2026, the IDHW intends to replace the UPL program with a Medicaid managed care state directed payment program. We are unable to predict whether payments levels under the planned new state directed payment program will be comparable to the SFY 2025 UPL payment levels.\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $5 million during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and approximately $21 million and $27 million recorded during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nWashington Safety Net Assessment Program\nOn April 2, 2024, CMS approved an expanded state directed payment program in Washington whereby payments will now be based on the average commercial rates. The program was approved retroactively for the period January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024.\n \nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $13 million and $12 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and approximately $39 million and $32 million recorded during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursement pursuant to this expanded program will approximate $51 million during the year ended December 31, 2025. The program for the period of January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 was approved by CMS.\nNew Mexico State Directed Payment Program (“SDP”)\n \nIn November, 2024, CMS approved the New Mexico Medicaid SDP, retroactive to July 1, 2024, based on average commercial rates. The New Mexico SDP provides for an additional payment for Medicaid managed care contracted services.  The program requires the submission of an annual report that demonstrates that 75% of the incremental net funds were used for the delivery of and access to healthcare services in the state.\nThe New Mexico SDP for the period of January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 was approved by CMS.\n \nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $10 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025 and, approximately $25 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025.  No revenue was recorded during the three-month or nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $30 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nTennessee Directed Payment Program (“DPP”)\nTennessee SB1740, enacted in May, 2024, imposes an annual coverage assessment on covered hospitals for fiscal year 2024-2025. The total assessment on all covered hospitals in the aggregate will be equal to 6% of the federally recognized annual coverage assessment base. The assessment proceeds will be used to fund an increase to the state’s DPP payment pool to be based on average commercial rates.\n \nIn January, 2025, CMS approved the DPP payment increase for the period July 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, contingent upon CMS' approval of the state's 1115 Medicaid Waiver amendment. In addition, the DPP program for calendar year 2025 (January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025) was approved by CMS in April, 2025, also contingent upon CMS' approval of the state's 1115 Medicaid Waiver amendment which was approved by CMS in June, 2025.\nDuring the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, we recorded $11 million in net reimbursements from this program and $69 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 ($29 million of which related to the period of July 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024). No revenue was recorded during the three-month or nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 related to the DPP program.\n \nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $83 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n \nWashington, D.C. State Directed Payment program (“SDP”)\nIn September, 2025, CMS approved the SDP program for the period October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025.  This SDP program provides for an add-on to in-network Medicaid managed care paid claims.\n \nIncluded in our results of operations during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025, was $90 million of reimbursements (net of related provider taxes), covering the period of October 1, 2024 through September 30,2025 in connection with this program. We estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program, including the recently opened acute care hospital, will approximate $117 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\n \nTexas DSH and Nevada SPA Programs:\nTexas DSH\nUpon meeting certain conditions and serving a disproportionately high share of Texas’ low income patients, our qualifying facilities located in Texas receive additional reimbursement from the state’s DSH fund. The Texas DSH program was renewed for the state’s 2026 DSH fiscal year (covering the period of October 1, 2025 through September 30, 2026).\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $12 million and $14 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively and, approximately $27 million and $28 million was recorded during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe estimate that our aggregate net reimbursements earned pursuant to the Texas DSH program will approximate $33 million during year ended December 31, 2025.\nThe ACA and subsequent federal legislation provides for a significant reduction in Medicaid disproportionate share payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2026 (see above in Sources of Revenues and Health Care Reform-Medicaid for additional disclosure related to the delay of these DSH reductions). HHS is to determine the amount of Medicaid DSH payment cuts imposed on each state based on a defined methodology. As Medicaid DSH payments to states will be cut, consequently, payments to Medicaid-participating providers, including our hospitals in Texas, will be reduced in the coming years. Based on the CMS final rule published in September, 2019 (as amended by the CARES Act and the CAA), beginning in fiscal year 2026, annual Medicaid DSH payments in Texas could be reduced by approximately 33% from current DSH payment levels. However, states have discretion in the allocation of their respective federal DSH allotment and we do not believe the state's allocation will result in a material decrease to DSH payment levels to our hospitals located in Texas. A series of federal continuing resolutions were passed by the federal government which provided for ongoing federal funding.\nIn connection with certain previous DSH and UC adverse federal court decisions, including the \nChildren’s Hospital Association of Texas v. Azar, \nwe continue to maintain reserves in the financial statements for cumulative Medicaid DSH and UC reimbursements related to our behavioral health hospitals located in Texas that amounted to $35 million as of September 30, 2025 and $34 million as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNevada State Plan Amendment (\"SPA\")\nCMS initially approved an SPA in Nevada in August, 2014 and this SPA has been approved for additional state fiscal years, including the 2024 fiscal year covering the period of July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024. CMS approval for the 2025 fiscal year, which is still pending, is expected to occur.\nIn connection with this program, included in our results of operations was approximately $4 million during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and approximately $13 million during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nWe estimate that our net reimbursements pursuant to this program will approximate $18 million during the year ended December 31, 2025.\nLegislation Commonly Known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBBA\")\nThe OBBBA was enacted into law on July 4, 2025. This legislation includes material changes to the Medicaid program and other healthcare related programs including but not limited to:\nMedicaid State Directed Payments (“SDP”)\n \n•\nIn states that expanded their Medicaid programs under the ACA (\"Expansion States\"), the SDP payment rate is capped at 100% of Medicare.\n•\nFor states that did not expand Medicaid under the ACA (\"Non-Expansion States\"), the SDP rate is capped at 110% of Medicare.\n•\nThese provisions grandfathered SDP programs already in existence or pending approval from CMS. Beginning with the 2028 state fiscal years, SDP provisions pursuant to the OBBBA are being phased in whereby grandfathered payment plans will be reduced by no more than 10% annually until the applicable Medicare rate is reached.\n \nLimits on Provider Taxes\n•\nPrior law capped Provider Taxes at 6% of net patient revenue. The new law reduces the percentage of revenue that can be taxed as a Provider Tax.\n•\nThe Provider Tax provisions pursuant to the OBBBA are largely being phased in over a 5-year period. \n•\nIn Expansion States, beginning with the 2028 state fiscal years, this percentage will be reduced by 0.5% each year until it reaches 3.5%. In Non-Expansion States, the Provider Tax percentage will remain unchanged. \n•\nEstablishes new discretion for CMS to refuse waivers of Provider Tax uniformity requirement.\n \nRural Health Transformation Program\n•\nEstablishes a $50 billion rural health grant program for states between fiscal years 2026 and 2030 to be used for payments to rural health facilities. 50% of the fund will go to states equally and 50% will be allocated based on a rural formula determined by the HHS Secretary.\n•\nAlthough certain of our hospitals that are designated by CMS as rural may be eligible for reimbursement pursuant to this fund,\n \nwe are unable to predict if any of our facilities will ultimately qualify for reimbursement and are therefore unable to quantify any potential favorable impact on our future results of operations.   \n \nMedicaid Eligibility:\n•\nInstitutes an 80-hour a month work requirement for all Medicaid individuals ages 19-64, with some exceptions. \n•\nRequires states to conduct eligibility redeterminations at least every 6 months for Medicaid expansion adults effective on or after December 31, 2026.\n•\nAlthough we cannot predict the potential unfavorable impact on our future results of operations from these changes to Medicaid eligibility requirements, these changes could reduce the overall number of Medicaid enrollees thereby potentially decreasing our Medicaid revenues (including revenues earned pursuant to various state Medicaid supplemental payment programs) while potentially increasing the level of uncompensated care provided by our facilities.   \nAs noted above, the OBBBA has specific legislative language that will reduce SDP payments as well as limit Provider Taxes used by states to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid supplemental payments.  However, certain OBBBA provisions that would impact payment levels could be subject to some interpretation by CMS and related future federal rulemaking such as the definition of an SDP grandfathered program.\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBased upon our current projected 2025 full year net benefit related to various state Medicaid supplemental payment programs, amounting to approximately $1.322 billion, as reflected on the table above in \nSummary of Various State Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs, \nwe estimate that, commencing with the 2028 state fiscal years, our aggregate annual net benefit will be reduced, on an annually increasing and relatively pro rata basis, by approximately $420 million to $470 million in 2032. We cannot predict, among other things, if this legislation will ultimately be implemented as enacted, or if certain states may attempt to modify their respective SDP program in response to the OBBBA legislation. Given the various uncertainties and evolving state-by-state interpretations and computations related to this legislation, our forecasted estimates are subject to change, potentially by material amounts.\n \nOther Risk Factors Related To State Supplemental Medicaid Payments:\nAs outlined above, we receive substantial reimbursement from multiple states in connection with various supplemental Medicaid payment programs. Failure to renew these programs beyond their scheduled termination dates, failure of the public hospitals to provide the necessary IGTs for the states’ share of the DSH programs, failure of our hospitals that currently receive supplemental Medicaid revenues to qualify for future funds under these programs, or reductions in reimbursements, could cause our estimates to differ by material amounts which could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nIn April, 2016, CMS published its final Medicaid Managed Care Rule which explicitly permits but phases out the use of pass-through payments (including supplemental payments) by Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (“MCO”) to hospitals over ten years but allows for a transition of the pass-through payments into value-based payment structures, delivery system reform initiatives or payments tied to services under a MCO contract. Since we are unable to determine the financial impact of this aspect of the final rule, we can provide no assurance that the final rule will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. In November, 2020, CMS issued a final rule permitting pass-through supplemental provider payments during a time-limited period when states transition populations or services from fee-for-service Medicaid to managed care.\nWe receive Medicaid SDP payments from MCOs authorized by CMS under 42 CFR § 438.6(c). Consistent with capitated rates paid by Medicaid state agencies to MCO’s for managing Medicaid beneficiary lives under a risk-based arrangement, SDP program related capitated rates must also be developed by the state in accordance with actuarial soundness standards noted at 42 CFR § 438.4 and non-compliance could result in a reduction to SDP payment levels. In general, Medicaid SDP payments under 42 CFR § 438.6(c) are subject to annual CMS approval via the submission of a preprint application by a state agency which provides details of the SDP payment methodology and conformity with the applicable federal regulations. CMS SDP preprint approval, and the timing of such approval (if it occurs), are uncertain, which can affect both the SDP payment level and the timing of SDP revenue we record.\nWe incur Provider Taxes imposed by states in the form of a licensing fee, assessment or other mandatory payment which are related to: (i) healthcare items or services; (ii) the provision of, or the authority to provide, the health care items or services, or; (iii) the payment for the health care items or services that are used by respective states to finance the non-federal share of SDP’s (or other Medicaid supplemental payment programs). Such Provider Taxes are subject to various federal regulations that limit the scope and amount of the taxes that can be levied by states in order to secure federal matching funds as part of their respective state Medicaid supplemental payment programs. States are subject to CMS both concurrent and retrospective review for their compliance with the applicable Provider Tax regulations and related federal statute. If CMS determines Provider Taxes used by a state Medicaid program to finance the non-federal share of a SDP (or other Medicaid supplemental payment programs) are not in compliance with the applicable Provider Tax regulations and related federal statute, Company SDP payments (and other Medicaid supplemental payments) could be subject to recoupment by the respective state agency when non-compliance is determined by CMS to exist.\nWe believe that the SDP (and other state supplemental payment) programs are designed by each state to be in full compliance with the applicable federal regulations and federal statutes. However, we are unable to provide assurance CMS will determine on a retroactive basis that a state’s SDP (or other Medicaid supplemental payment program) design and Medicaid financing structures is in full compliance with the applicable federal regulations and federal statute(s).\nOn April 22, 2024, CMS issued Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\") Managed Care Access, Finance, and Quality Final Rule (“Managed Care Rule”).  CMS intends for the Managed Care Rule to:\n•\nStrengthen standard for timely access to care and states’ monitoring and enforcement efforts; \n•\nEnhance quality and fiscal and program integrity standards for state directed payments (“SDPs”);\n•\nSpecify the scope of in lieu of services and settings to better address health-related social needs;\n•\nFurther specify medical loss ratio requirements, and;\n•\nEstablish a quality rating system for Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans.\n \nThe SDP provisions included in the Managed Care Rule:\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nRequires that provider payment levels for state directed payments for inpatient and outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, and the professional services at an academic medical center not exceed the average commercial rate;\n•\nProhibits the use of post-payment reconciliation processes for state directed payments that are based on fee schedules;\n•\nMakes explicit in regulation the existing requirement that state directed payments must comply with all federal laws concerning funding sources of the non-federal share, and;\n•\nRequires that states ensure each provider receiving a state directed payment attest that it does not participate in any arrangement that holds taxpayers harmless for the cost of a tax. CMS concurrently released an informational bulletin regarding CMS’ exercise of enforcement discretion until calendar year 2028 for existing health-care related tax programs with certain hold-harmless arrangements involving the redistribution of Medicaid payments.\nFee-For-Service Short-Doyle Medi-Cal (“SD/MC”) Hospitals Change In Payment Methodology:\nUnder the California Medicaid prepaid inpatient health plan program, counties are required to ensure delivery of mental health services utilizing a system of county operated and contract providers. The California Medicaid program has adopted a new reimbursement method for inpatient psychiatric services with an effective date of December 12, 2023, incorporated a cost-based ceiling to negotiated rates.  This change may require renegotiation of contracts Company hospitals have had with counties, retroactive to December 12, 2023, and may also impact prospective rate negotiations.  New California Medicaid rates could be materially lower than prior payment rates particularly if counties look to limit payment rates to a cost-based methodology rather than a market-based negotiated rate.  We are awaiting formal guidance from California as to the manner in which this change will be implemented and whether the reimbursement method will change prospectively. Further, it is uncertain at this time whether and how counties will retroactively apply this change in method retroactively to December 12, 2023, given the previously negotiated payment terms. We are unable to predict with certainty the impact of this SPA at this time.  However, under some scenarios, the adverse financial impact could be material.\nAs disclosed herein, we receive a significant amount of Medicaid and Medicaid managed care revenue from both base payments and supplemental payments. Although we are unable to estimate the impact of the Managed Care Rule on our future results of operations, if implemented as proposed, Managed Care Rule related changes could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.\nFuture changes to the terms and conditions of the various programs outlined above could materially reduce our net benefit derived from the programs which could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. In addition, Provider Taxes are governed by both federal and state laws and are subject to future legislative changes that, if reduced from current rates in several states, could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations.\nA 6.2% increase to the Medicaid Federal Matching Assistance Percentage (“FMAP”) was included in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. The CAA of 2023 provided for the transitional reduction of the 6.2% enhanced FMAP during 2023 to 5.0% during the second quarter, 2.5% during the third quarter and 1.5% during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nHITECH Act: \nIn July 2010, HHS published final regulations implementing the health information technology provisions of the American\n \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act (referred to as the “HITECH Act”). The final regulation defines the “meaningful use” of Electronic Health Records (“EHR”) and establishes the requirements for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR payment incentive programs. The final rule established an initial set of standards and certification criteria. The implementation period for these Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments started in federal fiscal year 2011 and can end as late as 2016 for Medicare and 2021 for the state Medicaid programs. State Medicaid program participation in this federally funded incentive program is voluntary but all of the states in which our eligible hospitals operate have chosen to participate. Our acute care hospitals qualified for these EHR incentive payments upon implementation of the EHR application assuming they meet the “meaningful use” criteria. The government’s ultimate goal is to promote more effective (quality) and efficient healthcare delivery through the use of technology to reduce the total cost of healthcare for all Americans and utilizing the cost savings to expand access to the healthcare system.\nAll of our acute care hospitals have met the applicable meaningful use criteria. However, under the HITECH Act, hospitals must continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria in each fiscal year or they will be subject to a market basket update reduction in a subsequent fiscal year. Failure of our acute care hospitals to continue to meet the applicable meaningful use criteria would have an adverse effect on our future net revenues and results of operations.\nIn the 2019 IPPS final rule, CMS overhauled the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program to focus on interoperability, improve flexibility, relieve burden and place emphasis on measures that require the electronic exchange of health information between providers and patients. We can provide no assurance that the changes will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nManaged Care: \nA significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies, which include health maintenance\n \norganizations, preferred provider organizations and managed Medicare (referred to as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage) and Medicaid programs. In general, we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to\n \n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ngrow. The consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate. Typically, we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payers than we do from traditional indemnity insurers, however, during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payers including managed care companies.\nCommercial Insurance: \nOur hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance. Private insurance carriers\n \ntypically make direct payments to hospitals or, in some cases, reimburse their policy holders, based upon the particular hospital’s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy. Private insurance reimbursement varies among payers and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payer.\nCommercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms, including predetermined payment or DRG-based payment systems, for more inpatient and outpatient services. To the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers’ reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries, such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals.\nSurprise Billing Interim Final Rule: \nOn September 30, 2021, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury, along with the Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”), released an interim final rule with comment period, entitled “Requirements Related to Surprise Billing; Part II.” This rule is related to Title I (the “No Surprises Act”) of Division BB of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and establishes new protections from surprise billing and excessive cost sharing for consumers receiving health care items/services. It implements additional protections against surprise medical bills under the No Surprises Act, including provisions related to the independent dispute resolution (\"IDR\") process, good faith estimates for uninsured (or self-pay) individuals, the patient-provider dispute resolution process, and expanded rights to external review. On February 28, 2022, a district judge in the Eastern District of Texas invalidated portions of the rule governing aspects of the IDR process. In light of this decision, the government issued a final rule on August 19, 2022 eliminating the rebuttable presumption in favor of the qualifying payment amount by the IDR entity and providing additional factors the IDR entity should consider when choosing between two competing offers. CMS regulations and guidance implementing the IDR process has been subject to a significant amount of provider-initiated litigation. As a result, portions of those regulations and guidance materials have been vacated by a federal district court, causing CMS to, on several occasions, pause and resume IDR process operations, causing significant delay in the processing of claims. On October 27, 2023, HHS, the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury, and OPM issued a proposed rule intended to improve the functioning of the federal IDR process. Additionally, arguments made by the plaintiffs in such litigation have included allegations that CMS’s regulations and guidance materials are favorable to payers. We cannot predict the impact of the proposed rule on our operations at this time.\nOther Sources: \nOur hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage. Such patients are evaluated, at the\n \ntime of service or shortly thereafter, for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines, qualifications for Medicaid or other state assistance programs, as well as our local hospitals’ indigent and charity care policy. Patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for Medicaid or indigent care write-offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances.\nHealth Care Reform: \nListed below are the Medicare, Medicaid and other health care industry changes which have been, or are scheduled to be,\n \nimplemented as a result of the ACA.\nMedicaid Federal DSH Allotment\n:\nAlthough the implementation has been delayed several times, the ACA (as amended by subsequent federal legislation) requires annual aggregate reductions in federal Medicaid DSH allotment. Commencing in federal fiscal year 2026, and continuing through 2028, DSH payments are scheduled to be reduced by $8 billion annually. The American Relief Act, 2025 (HR 10545, Public Law No. 118-158) enacted into law on December 21, 2024 postponed the scheduled ACA Medicaid DSH cuts that were to take effect January 1, 2025 to April 1, 2025.  Subsequently H.R.1968 - Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025 enacted into law on March 15, 2024 further postponed the scheduled ACA Medicaid DSH cuts that were to take effect April 1, 2025 to October 1, 2025.\nValue-Based Purchasing:\nThere is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events. Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.\nThe ACA required HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services which became effective on October 1, 2012. The ACA requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years. HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality\n \n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nperformance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions. As part of the FFY 2022 IPPS final rule and FFY 2023 final rule, as discussed above, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS has implemented a budget neutral payment policy to fully offset the 2% VBP withhold during each of FFY 2022 and FFY 2023. In FFY 2024, as part of the FFY 2024 IPPS final rule, CMS removed the budget neutral policy that was in place in FFY 2022 and FFY 2023.\nHospital Acquired Conditions:\nThe ACA prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions (“HAC”). Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments. As part of the FFY 2023 final rule discussed above, and as a result of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, CMS suppressed all nine measures in the HAC Reduction Program for the FY 2023 program year and eliminated the HAC reduction program’s one percent payment penalty. In FFY 2024, as part of the FFY 2024 IPPS final rule, CMS eliminated the suppression of the applicable HAC measures and as a result reinstated the HAC reduction program.\nReadmission Reduction Program:\nIn the ACA, Congress also mandated implementation of the hospital readmission reduction program (“HRRP”). Hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard. The HRRP currently assesses penalties on hospitals having excess readmission rates for heart failure, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\"COPD\") and elective total hip arthroplasty (\"THA\") and/or total knee arthroplasty (\"TKA\"), excluding planned readmissions, when compared to expected rates. In the fiscal year 2015 IPPS final rule, CMS added readmissions for coronary artery bypass graft (\"CABG\") surgical procedures beginning in fiscal year 2017. To account for excess readmissions, an applicable hospital's base operating DRG payment amount is adjusted for each discharge occurring during the fiscal year. Readmissions payment adjustment factors can be no more than a 3% reduction. As part of the FFY 2023 IPPS final rule discussed above, CMS modified all of the condition-specific readmission measures to include an adjustment for patient history of COVID-19 for FFY 2024.\nAccountable Care Organizations:\nThe ACA requires HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of accountable care organizations (“ACOs”). The ACO program allows providers (including hospitals), physicians and other designated professionals and suppliers to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. CMS also developed and implemented more advanced ACO payment models that require ACOs to assume greater risk for attributed beneficiaries. Through various subsidiaries, we participate in ACOs in many of our acute care hospital markets.\nInfectious Disease Outbreaks, Pandemics, or Other Public Health Emergencies or Crisis\n \nOur business and financial results may be harmed by an international, national or localized outbreak of a highly contagious or epidemic disease, including but not limited to, COVID-19 or similar corona viruses, Ebola or Zika, may put stress on the capacity of all or a part of our health care facilities, could result in an abnormally high demand for health care services, require that resources be diverted from one part of operations to another part, or disrupt the supply chain for equipment and supplies necessary for operations. In addition, unaffected individuals may decide to defer elective procedures or otherwise avoid medical treatment, resulting in reduced patient volumes and operating revenues.\nIn addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the Medicare program and each of the state Medicaid programs, our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings, new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations, post-payment audits, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities. The final determination of amounts we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often takes many years, because of audits by the program representatives, providers’ rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions. We believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments. Nevertheless, until final adjustments are made, certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required.\nFinally, we expect continued third-party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls. Reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third-party payers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results.\n \n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Operating Results\nInterest Expense:\n \nAs reflected on the schedule below, interest expense was $38 million and $45 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $114 million and $146 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively (amounts in thousands):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine Months\nEnded\nSeptember 30,\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevolving credit facility (a.)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,541\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,729\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n9,027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,299\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranche A term loan, extinguished (a.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n36,157\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n113,934\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranche A term loan, 2029 (a.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17,093\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,055\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n51,281\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,055\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$800 million, 2.65% Senior Notes due 2030\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,356\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,356\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16,069\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16,069\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$700 million, 1.65% Senior Notes due 2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,932\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,932\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,795\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8,794\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$500 million, 2.65% Senior Notes due 2032\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,345\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,345\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,035\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,035\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$500 million, 4.625% Senior Notes due 2029 (b.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,793\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n322\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17,376\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n322\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n$500 million, 5.050% Senior Notes due 2034 (c.)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,352\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n353\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19,056\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n353\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtotal-revolving credit, term loan A and Senior Notes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45,412\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n52,249\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n131,639\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n165,861\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization of financing fees\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,245\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,255\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,749\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,769\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther combined interest expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,476\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,869\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,670\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,713\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapitalized interest on major projects\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(9,516\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(10,345\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(24,265\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(27,922\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(186\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(368\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(942\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,036\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense, net\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n38,431\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n44,660\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n113,851\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n146,385\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(a.)\nOn September 26, 2024, we entered into the tenth amendment to our credit agreement dated November 15, 2010, as amended and restated at various times from March, 2011 to June, 2022 (the \"Credit Agreement\"). The tenth amendment provided for, among other things, the following: (i) an extension of the maturity date to September 26, 2029; (ii) a $100 million increase in the revolving credit facility to $1.3 billion of aggregate borrowing capacity (which as of September 30, 2025, had $965 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity, net of $332 million of borrowings outstanding and $3 million of letters of credit), and; (iii) a $1.0 billion reduction in the outstanding borrowings pursuant to the tranche A term loan facility, to $1.2 billion from $2.2 billion previously, utilizing the proceeds generated from the September, 2024, issuance of the below-mentioned senior notes due in 2029 and 2034.\n(b.)\nIn September, 2024, we completed the offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due in 2029.\n(c.)\nIn September, 2024, we completed the offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.050% Senior Notes due in 2034.\nInterest expense decreased by $6 million, or 14%, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was due primarily to a net $7 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, term loan A and senior notes. The decrease resulted from a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities (3.97% during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to 4.70% during the comparable quarter of 2024), offset by an increase in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings pursuant to these facilities ($4.46 billion during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to $4.34 billion during the third quarter of 2024).\n \nInterest expense decreased by $33 million, or 22%, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was due primarily to a net $34 million decrease in aggregate interest expense on our revolving credit, term loan A and senior notes. The decrease resulted from a decrease in our aggregate average cost of borrowings pursuant to these facilities (3.97% during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to 4.83% during the comparable period of 2024), as well as a decrease in the aggregate average outstanding borrowings pursuant to these facilities ($4.36 billion during the first nine months of 2025 as compared to $4.50 billion during the first nine months of 2024).\n \nThe average outstanding borrowings and the average effective interest rate, which includes amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, under our revolving credit, term loan A and senior notes, were approximately $4.46 billion and 4.1%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2025, and $4.34 billion and 4.8%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2024. The average outstanding borrowings and average effective interest rate on these facilities were approximately $4.36 billion and 4.1%, respectively, during the first nine months of 2025, and $4.50 billion and 5.0%, respectively, during the first nine months of 2024.\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCosts Related to Early Extinguishment of Debt During September, 2024:\nIn connection with the financing transactions completed in September, 2024, our results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, include a pre-tax charge of approximately $6 million incurred for the costs related to the extinguishment of debt consisting of the following: (i) approximately $3 million incurred to write-off deferred charges (included in other (income) expenses, net, on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income), and; (ii) approximately $3 million resulting from certain financing fees incurred during the third quarter of 2024 (included in other operating expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income).\n \nProvision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates:\nThe effective tax rates, as calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before income taxes, were as follows for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThree months ended\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNine months ended\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n117,781\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n75,623\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n327,354\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n233,563\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome before income taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n496,886\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n341,533\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,390,699\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,059,625\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nThe provision for income taxes increased $42 million during the third quarter of 2025, as compared to the comparable quarter of 2024, due primarily to: (i) the increase in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $156 million increase in pre-tax income (consisting of $155 million increase in income before income taxes and a $1 million favorable change in the income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interest), and; (ii) a $3 million increase in the provision for income taxes due to a decrease in the net benefit recorded in connection with ASU 2016-09 ($0.6 million net benefit recorded during the third quarter of 2025 as compared to $3.9 million during the third quarter of 2024). Excluding the impact of ASU 2019-09, our effective tax rates were 24.1% and 23.8% during the third quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nThe provision for income taxes increased $94 million during the first nine months of 2025, as compared to the comparable period of 2024, due primarily to: (i) the increase in the provision for income taxes resulting from the $327 million increase in pre-tax income (consisting of $331 million increase in income before income taxes and a $4 million unfavorable change in the income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interest), and; (ii) a $14 million increase in the provision for income taxes due to a decrease in the net benefit recorded in connection with ASU 2016-09 ($1.9 million net benefit recorded during the nine months of 2025 as compared to $15.5 million during the nine months of 2024).  Excluding the impact of ASU 2019-09, our effective tax rates were 24.0% and 23.9% during the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nDue to recent guidance and enacted laws surrounding the global 15% minimum tax rate that will be effective after 2024 from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") as well as jurisdictions that we operate in, we anticipate adverse effects to our provision for income taxes as well as cash taxes. We do not expect these adverse effects to be material and will continue to monitor changes in tax policies and laws issued by the OECD and jurisdictions that we operate in.\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiquidity\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.290 billion during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2025 and $1.409 billion during the first nine months of 2024. The net decrease of $119 million was attributable to the following:\n•\na favorable change of $257 million resulting from an increase in net income plus/minus depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, losses/gains on sales of assets and businesses, and costs related to the extinguishment of debt;\n•\nan unfavorable change of $306 million in accounts receivable (which includes the above-mentioned $90 million of net reimbursements related to the Washington, D.C. Medicaid directed payment program recorded during the third quarter of 2025, which we expect to receive during the fourth quarter of 2025, and a combined increase of $48 million during the first nine months of 2025 related to two relatively recently opened hospitals in Las Vegas, NV, and Washington, D.C.);\n•\nan unfavorable change of $41 million in payments made in settlement of self-insurance claims, net of commercial insurance reimbursements;\n•\nan unfavorable change of $28 million in accrued and deferred income taxes;\n•\nan unfavorable change of $24 million in other assets and deferred charges, and;\n•\n$23 million of other combined net favorable changes. \nDays sales outstanding (“DSO”):\n Our DSO are calculated by dividing our net revenue by the number of days in the nine-month periods. The result is divided into the accounts receivable balance at September 30th of each year to obtain the DSO. Our DSO were 55 days and 52 days at September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, we used $847 million of net cash in investing activities as follows:\n•\n$734 million spent on capital expenditures including costs related to a new acute care hospital being constructed in Florida and a replacement acute care facility in California, and capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities;\n•\n$49 million paid in connection with net cash outflows from forward exchange contracts that hedge our investment in the U.K. against movements in exchange rates; \n•\n$48 million spent on the acquisition of businesses and property;\n•\n$19 million paid in connection with the purchase and development of an enterprise resource planning application, and;\n•\n$3 million received from the sales of assets and businesses.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, we used $703 million of net cash in investing activities as follows:\n•\n$698 million spent on capital expenditures including capital expenditures for equipment, renovations and new projects at various existing facilities;\n•\n$36 million paid in connection with net cash outflows from forward exchange contracts that hedge our investment in the U.K. against movements in exchange rates, and;\n•\n$30 million received from the sales of assets and businesses.\nNet cash used in financing activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, we used $454 million of net cash in financing activities as follows:\n•\nspent $616 million to repurchase shares of our Class B Common Stock in connection with: (i) open market purchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program ($566 million), and; (ii) income tax withholding obligations related to stock-based compensation programs ($50 million);\n•\ngenerated $209 million of additional borrowings as follows: (i) $202 million pursuant to our revolving credit facility, and; (ii) $7 million related to other debt facilities; \n•\nspent $39 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.20 per share;\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nspent $28 million on net repayments of debt as follows: (i) $23 million related to our tranche A term loan facility, and; (ii) $5 million related to other debt facilities;\n•\nreceived $19 million from the sale of ownership interests to minority members;\n•\ngenerated $12 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans, and;\n•\nspent $10 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses;\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, we used $718 million of net cash in financing activities as follows:\n•\nspent $2.472 billion on net repayments of debt as follows: (i) $2.259 billion related to our previous tranche A term loan facility which was extinguished in September, 2024, and replaced with a new $1.2 billion tranche A term loan facility; (ii) $207 million related to our revolving credit facility, and; (iii) $6 million related to other debt facilities;\n•\ngenerated $2.210 billion of proceeds from additional borrowings as follows: (i) $1.200 billion related to our new tranche A term loan facility, as mentioned above; (ii) generated approximately $500 million of net proceeds (before expenses) related to the public offering, in September, 2024, of 4.625% senior secured notes due in 2029; (iii) generated approximately $498 million of net proceeds (before expenses) related to the public offering in September, 2024 of 5.050% senior secured notes due in 2034, and; (iv) $12 million of proceeds related to other debt facilities;\n•\nspent $421 million to repurchase shares of our Class B Common Stock in connection with: (i) open market purchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program ($349 million), and; (ii) income tax withholding obligations related to stock-based compensation programs ($72 million);\n•\nspent $40 million to pay quarterly cash dividends of $.20 per share;\n•\ngenerated $11 million from the issuance of shares of our Class B Common Stock pursuant to the terms of employee stock purchase plans;\n•\nspent $10 million to pay financing costs;\n•\nreceived $9 million from the sale of ownership interests to minority members, and;\n•\nspent $6 million to pay profit distributions related to noncontrolling interests in majority owned businesses.\nExpected capital expenditures during remainder of 2025\nDuring the full year of 2025, we expect to spend approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion on capital expenditures which includes expenditures for capital equipment, construction of new facilities, and renovations and expansions at existing hospitals. During the first nine months of 2025 we spent approximately $734 million on capital expenditures and expect to spend approximately $266 million to $366 million during the remainder of 2025.\nWe believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to expand, improve and equip our existing hospitals. We expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated funds and/or additional funds, as discussed below.\nCapital Resources\nCredit Facilities and Outstanding Debt Securities\nIn September 2024, we entered into a tenth amendment (\"Tenth Amendment\") to our credit agreement (\"Credit Agreement\"), dated as of November 15, 2010, as amended and restated at various times from March, 2011 to June, 2022, among UHS, as borrower, the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto, as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The Tenth Amendment provided for: (i) an extension of the maturity date to September 26, 2029; (ii) a new revolving credit facility of up to $1.3 billion (which as of September 30, 2025, had $965 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity, net of $332 million of outstanding borrowings and $3 million of letters of credit), and; (iii) a new replacement tranche A term loan facility (\"Tranche A Term Loan\") of up to $1.2 billion (which had $1.17 billion of outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2025).\nPursuant to the terms of the Tenth Amendment, the Tranche A Term Loan provides for installment payments of $7.5 million per quarter commencing on December 31, 2024 through September 30, 2026, and $15.0 million per quarter commencing on December 31, 2026 through June 30, 2029. The unpaid principal balance at June 30, 2029 (scheduled to be $975.0 million) is payable on the September 26, 2029 scheduled maturity date of the Credit Agreement.\nRevolving credit and Tranche A Term Loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at our election at either (1) the ABR rate which is defined as the rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the lender’s prime rate, (b) the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.5% and (c) one month term SOFR rate plus 1.1%, in each case, plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 0.25% to 0.625%, or (2) the one,\n \n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nthree or six month term SOFR rate plus 0.1% (at our election), plus an applicable margin based upon our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each quarter ranging from 1.25% to 1.625%. As of September 30, 2025, the applicable margins were 0.25% for ABR-based loans and 1.25% for SOFR-based loans under the revolving credit and term loan A facilities.  The revolving credit facility includes a $125 million sub-limit for letters of credit. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the Company and our material subsidiaries (which generally excludes asset classes such as substantially all of the patient-related accounts receivable of our acute care hospitals, if sold to a receivables facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and certain real estate assets and assets held in joint-ventures with third parties) and is guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.\nThe Credit Agreement includes a material adverse change clause that must be represented at each draw. The Credit Agreement also contains covenants that include a limitation on sales of assets, mergers, change of ownership, liens, indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, dividends and stock repurchases; and requires compliance with financial covenants including maximum leverage. We were in compliance with all required covenants as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had combined aggregate principal of $3.0 billion from the following senior secured notes:\n•\n$700 million of aggregate principal amount of 1.65% senior secured notes due in September, 2026 (\"2026 Notes\") which were issued on August 24, 2021. Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable on March 1st and September 1st until the maturity date of September 1, 2026.\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior secured notes due in October, 2029 (\"2029 Notes\") which were issued on September 26, 2024. Interest on the 2029 Notes is payable on April 15th and October 15th, commencing April 15, 2025 until the maturity date of October 15, 2029.\n•\n$800 million of aggregate principal amount of 2.65% senior secured notes due in October, 2030 (\"2030 Notes\") which were issued on September 21, 2020. Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable on April 15th and October 15th, until the maturity date of October 15, 2030.\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of 2.65% senior secured notes due in January, 2032 (\"2032 Notes\") which were issued on August 24, 2021. Interest on the 2032 Notes is payable on January 15th and July 15th until the maturity date of January 15, 2032.\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.050% senior secured notes due in October, 2034 (\"2034 Notes\") which were issued on September 26, 2024. Interest on the 2034 Notes is payable on April 15th and October 15th, commencing on April 15, 2025 until the maturity date of October 15, 2034.\nThe 2026, 2029, 2030, 2032 and 2034 Notes (collectively \"All the Notes\") are guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) on a senior secured basis by all of our existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries that guarantee our Credit Agreement, other first lien obligations, or any junior lien obligations (the \"Subsidiary Guarantors\").  All the Notes and the Guarantees are secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on certain of the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ assets now owned or acquired in the future by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors (other than real property, accounts receivable sold pursuant to a Company-related receivables facility (as defined in the Indenture pursuant to which All the Notes were issued (the “Indentures”), and certain other excluded assets). The Company’s obligations with respect to All the Notes, the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Guarantees, and the performance of all of the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ other obligations under the Indentures, are secured equally and ratably with the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ obligations under the Credit Agreement. However, the liens on the collateral securing All the Notes and the Guarantees will be released if: (i) All the Notes have investment grade ratings; (ii) no default has occurred and is continuing, and; (iii) the liens on the collateral securing all first lien obligations (including the Credit Agreement and All the Notes) and any junior lien obligations are released or the collateral under the Credit Agreement, any other first lien obligations and any junior lien obligations is released or no longer required to be pledged. The liens on any collateral securing All the Notes and the Guarantees will also be released if the liens on that collateral securing the Credit Agreement, other first lien obligations and any junior lien obligations are released.\nIn connection with an asset purchase and sale agreement, and related lease agreements, completed with Universal Health Realty Income Trust (\"Trust\") in December 2021, our consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 reflect financial liabilities, which are included in debt, of approximately $71 million and $74 million, respectively. In connection with that transaction, as a result of our purchase option within the lease agreements related to two of our facilities, the asset purchase and sale transaction was accounted for as a failed sale leaseback in accordance with U.S. GAAP and we have accounted for the transaction as a financing arrangement. Our lease payments payable to the Trust are recorded to interest expense and as a reduction of the outstanding financial liability, and the amount allocated to interest expense is determined based upon our incremental borrowing rate and the outstanding financial liability.\nAt September 30, 2025, the carrying value and fair value of our debt were approximately $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value and fair value of our debt were approximately $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. The fair value of our debt was computed based upon quotes received from financial institutions. We consider these to be “level 2” in the fair value hierarchy as outlined in the authoritative guidance for disclosures in connection with debt instruments.\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur total debt as a percentage of total capitalization was approximately 40% as of both September 30, 2025 and  December 31, 2024.\nWe expect to finance all capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay dividends and potentially repurchase shares of our common stock utilizing internally generated and additional funds. Additional funds may be obtained through: (i) borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility, which had $965 million of available borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2025, or through refinancing the existing Credit Agreement; (ii) the issuance of other short-term and/or long-term debt, and/or; (iii) the issuance of equity. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, available commitments under existing agreements, as well as access to the capital markets, provide us with sufficient capital resources to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months. However, in the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time. Our inability to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us could have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had combined aggregate principal of $3.0 billion from All the Notes:\n•\n$700 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes;\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes;\n•\n$800 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes;\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2032 Notes, and;\n•\n$500 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2034 Notes.\nAll the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed pursuant to the Guarantees on a senior secured basis by the Subsidiary Guarantors.  All the Notes and the Guarantees are secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on certain of the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ assets now owned or acquired in the future by the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors (other than real property, accounts receivable sold pursuant to the Company’s existing receivables facility (as defined in the Indentures pursuant to which All the Notes were issued ), and certain other excluded assets). The Company’s obligations with respect to All the Notes, the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Guarantees, and the performance of all of the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ other obligations under the Indentures, are secured equally and ratably with the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ obligations under the Credit Agreement. However, the liens on the collateral securing All the Notes and the Guarantees will be released if: (i) All the Notes have investment grade ratings; (ii) no default has occurred and is continuing, and; (iii) the liens on the collateral securing all first lien obligations (including the Credit Agreement and All the Notes) and any junior lien obligations are released or the collateral under the Credit Agreement, any other first lien obligations and any junior lien obligations is released or no longer required to be pledged. The liens on any collateral securing All the Notes and the Guarantees will also be released if the liens on that collateral securing the Credit Agreement, other first lien obligations and any junior lien obligations are released.\nAll the Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of our existing and future subsidiaries that are not and do not become Subsidiary Guarantors of All the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the collateral has been made, and the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. Consequently, liquidating the collateral securing All the Notes may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on All the Notes.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although our Credit Agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and our Credit Agreement and All the Notes contain restrictions on our ability to incur liens to secure additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, if we incur any additional indebtedness secured by liens that rank equally with All the Notes, subject to collateral arrangements, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with holders of All the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of our company. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to holders of All the Notes.\nFederal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of All the Notes and the incurrence of the Guarantees. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, All the Notes or the Guarantees (or the grant of collateral securing any such obligations) could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if we or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, as applicable, (a) issued All the Notes or incurred the Guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (b) under certain circumstances received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing All the Notes or incurring the Guarantees.\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBasis of Presentation\nThe following tables include summarized financial information of Universal Health Services, Inc. and the other obligors in respect of debt issued by Universal Health Services, Inc. The summarized financial information of each obligor group is presented on a combined basis with balances and transactions within the obligor group eliminated.

Such collateral securities are secured equally and ratably with our and the Guarantors’ obligations under our Credit Agreement. For a list of our subsidiaries the capital stock of which has been pledged to secure All the Notes, see Exhibit 22.1 to this Report.\nUpon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the indentures governing All the Notes, subject to the terms of the Security Agreement relating to All the Notes provide for (among other available remedies) the foreclosure upon and sale of the Collateral (including the pledged stock) and the distribution of the net proceeds of any such sale to the holders of All the Notes, the lenders under the Credit Agreement and the holders of any other permitted first priority secured obligations on a pro rata basis, subject to any prior liens on the collateral.\nNo appraisal of the value of the collateral securities has been made, and the value of the collateral securities in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. Consequently, liquidating the collateral securities securing All the Notes may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on All the Notes.\nThe security agreement relating to All the Notes provides that the representative of the lenders under our Credit Agreement will initially control actions with respect to that collateral and, consequently, exercise of any right, remedy or power with respect to enforcing interests in or realizing upon such collateral will initially be at the direction of the representative of the lenders.\nNo trading market exists for the capital stock pledged as collateral.\nThe assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial information of Universal Health Services, Inc.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025 there have been no material changes in the off-balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds.\nAs of September 30, 2025 we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements consisting of standby letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled $177 million consisting of: (i) $156 million related to our self-insurance programs, and; (ii) $21 million of other debt and public utility guarantees.\n \n\n\n66"
