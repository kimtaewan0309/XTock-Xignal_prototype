  "item1": "ITEM 1.    BUSINESS\nUnless otherwise noted in this report, any description of \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\" includes Molson Coors Beverage Company (\"MCBC\" or the \"Company\"), principally a holding company, and its operating and non-operating subsidiaries included within its reporting segments. Our reporting segments include the Americas and EMEA&APAC. Unless otherwise indicated, information in this report is presented in USD and comparisons are to comparable prior periods. Our primary operating currencies, other than the USD, include the CAD, the GBP and our Central European operating currencies, such as the EUR, CZK, RON and RSD.\nBusiness and Market Overview\nOur History\nFor more than two centuries, we have brewed beverages that unite people to celebrate all life’s moments. From our core power brands \nCoors Light, Miller Lite, Coors Banquet, Molson Canadian, Carling\n and \nOžujsko\n to our above premium brands including \nMadrí Excepcional, Staropramen, Blue Moon Belgian White\n and \nLeinenkugel’s Summer Shandy\n, to our economy and value brands like \nMiller High Life\n and \nKeystone Light\n, we produce many beloved and iconic beers. While our Company's history is rooted in beer, we offer a modern portfolio that expands beyond the beer aisle as well, including flavored beverages like \nVizzy Hard Seltzer\n, spirits like \nFive Trail\n whiskey and non-alcoholic beverages. We also have partner brands, such as \nSimply Spiked\n, \nZOA Energy\n, among others, through license, distribution, partnership and joint venture agreements. As a business, our ambition is to be the first choice for our people, our consumers and our customers, and our success depends on our ability to make our products available to meet a wide range of consumer segments and occasions.\nOur primary founders, the Molson, Coors and Miller families date back over two centuries. Our commitment to producing the highest quality beers is a key part of our heritage and remains so to this day. Our brands are designed to appeal to a wide range of consumer tastes, styles and price preferences. Coors Brewing Company was incorporated in June 1913 under the laws of the state of Colorado. In October 2003, Coors Brewing Company merged with and into Adolph Coors Company, a Delaware corporation. In February 2005, Adolph Coors Company merged with Molson Inc. (\"the Merger\"). Upon completion of the Merger, Adolph Coors Company changed its name to Molson Coors Brewing Company. In 2008, Molson Coors Brewing Company and the former SABMiller plc formed the MillerCoors joint venture that combined their respective operations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. In 2016, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity and voting interests of MillerCoors, from SABMiller plc. In January 2020, we changed our name from Molson Coors Brewing Company to Molson Coors Beverage Company in connection with our expansion beyond the beer aisle.\nOur Industry and Our Competitors\nThe brewing industry has significantly evolved over the years to become an increasingly global and complex market as the consolidation of brewers globally has resulted in a small number of large global brewers representing the majority of the worldwide beer market. Although we believe consolidation among current major brewers has largely concluded, the current landscape primarily features smaller-scale acquisitions including exports, licensing, and partnership arrangements. These activities continue to occur predominantly among the same global competitors that represent the majority of the market. While the majority of the market is represented by a small number of large global brewers, smaller local brewers continue to inhabit the market as consumers place value on locally-produced, regionally-sourced products.\nThe beer industry is highly competitive and our portfolio of beers competes with numerous brands in all segments which are produced by international, national, regional and local brewers. Competitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, brand recognition and loyalty, pricing, quality, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, product variety, and the ability to anticipate and respond to consumer tastes and preferences. We believe our brand portfolio gives us strong representation in all major beer categories. We are the fourth largest global brewer in the world. In the U.S. and Canada, we compete most directly with Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (\"ABI\") and Constellation Brands, Inc., but we also compete with imports and other providers of craft beer and flavored malt beverages. In the European countries where we currently operate, our primary competitors are Heineken, Asahi, Carlsberg and ABI.\nOur products also compete with other alcohol beverages, including wine and spirits, and thus their competitive position is affected by consumer preferences between and among these other categories. Sales of spirits have grown faster than sales of beer in recent years, driven by, among other things, increased spirits advertising, a narrowing price gap with spirits and the growth of spirits-based ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages. This has resulted in a reduction in the beer segment's lead in the overall alcohol beverage market over the last decade.\n5\nTable of \nContent\ns\nOur Strategy\nConsumer preferences have continued to shift within the industry to above premium products, with volume growth in recent years seen in flavored malt beverages, imports and super premium portfolios. Consumers are also expanding further into spirits, particularly to spirits-based ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages.\nIn addition, during 2023, in the U.S., we saw a shift in consumer purchasing behavior largely within the premium segment that drove an increase in our core power brands' net sales.\nAs the beer industry continues its diversification of its products to meet consumer demand with broadening preferences, we believe large global brewers are uniquely positioned to leverage the scale, depth of product portfolio and industry knowledge to continue to lead the market forward. Therefore, in October 2023, we announced our Acceleration Plan, building off the successes achieved under the Revitalization Plan, which was announced in October 2019. The Acceleration Plan focuses on the execution of the following principal strategies: consistently grow our core power brand net sales, aggressively premiumize our portfolio, scale and expand in beyond beer, invest in our capabilities and support our people, communities and planet. Under this plan, we aim to further accelerate our premiumization efforts, targeting one-third of our global brand portfolio within the above premium category in the medium term, while continuing to invest in operational enhancements and expanding beyond beer.\nOur core power brands, such as \nCoors Light\n, \nMiller Lite\n, \nCoors Banquet, Molson Canadian\n, \nCarling \nand\n Ožujsko\n are important to the success of our long-term growth and therefore, we have focused efforts to expand strategic distribution and increase brand visibility while staying relevant with consumers. \nWe believe we are well positioned to compete in this continually evolving market, particularly in beer and beyond beer, including, flavor, full strength spirits and non-alcoholic beverages where we think we have a right to win. This includes premiumizing our product mix, leveraging learnings from and building on the successes achieved in certain markets such as EMEA&APAC.\nOur investments in capabilities across our organization that support premiumization and focused innovation, supply chain efficiencies and commercial effectiveness across geographies are central to this strategy, designed to ensure that we have the infrastructure to support both profitable growth and diversification. \nOur Segments\nOur reporting segments include the Americas and EMEA&APAC. A separate operating team manages each segment and each segment manufactures, markets, distributes and sells beer as well as offers a modern and growing portfolio that expands beyond the beer aisle.\nAmericas Segment\nOur Americas segment consists of the production, importing, marketing, distribution and sales of our owned brands and partner brands and licensed brands in the U.S., Canada and various countries in Latin America. We currently operate nine primary breweries, three craft breweries and two container operations. The Americas segment also includes partnership arrangements with Brewers' Retail Inc. (\"BRI\") for the distribution of beer in Ontario, Canada, and Brewers' Distributor Ltd. (\"BDL\") for the distribution of beer in the western provinces of Canada. In addition, we have an agreement with Heineken that grants us the right to produce, import, market, distribute and sell certain Heineken products in Canada. We also have authorizations from The Coca-Cola Company that grant us the right to produce, market, sell and distribute \nSimply Spiked \nbranded products in the U.S. and Canada, as well as \nTopo Chico Hard Seltzer \nproducts in the U.S. We have agreements to brew, package and ship products for The Yuengling Company (\"TYC\") in the U.S. \nAdditionally, we had a contract brewing arrangement with Pabst Brewing Company, LLC, as well as a brewing and packaging agreement with FIFCO USA for Labatt brands in Canada for export, both of which ended in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nEMEA&APAC Segment\nThe EMEA&APAC segment consists of the production, marketing and sales of our primary brands as well as other owned and licensed brands in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Montenegro, the Republic of Ireland, Romania, Serbia, the U.K., various other European countries and certain countries within the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific regions. We currently operate eleven primary breweries, four craft breweries and one cidery. The majority of our EMEA&APAC segment sales are in the U.K., Croatia, Romania and the Czech Republic, with the U.K. representing over 55% of the segment's net sales in 2024.\n6\nTable of \nContent\ns\nOur portfolio includes beers that have the largest share in their respective segments, such as \nCarling \nin the U.K. and \nOžujsko\n in Croatia. We have beers that rank in the top five in market share in their respective segments throughout the region, such as \nStaropramen \nin the Czech Republic and \nBergenbier \nin Romania.\n \nAdditionally, we sell \nStaropramen, Coors,\n \nMadrí Excepcional \nand \nMiller Genuine Draft\n in various countries. Our EMEA&APAC segment includes the sale of factored brands in the U.K. which occurs when we distribute beer, wine, spirits and other products owned and produced by other companies to the on-premise channel, such as bars and restaurants. Sales from factored brands are included in our net sales and cost of goods sold when ultimately sold.\nUnallocated\nWe have certain activity that is not allocated to our segments, which is reflected in \"Unallocated\". Unallocated primarily includes certain financing-related activities such as interest expense and interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances as well as realized and unrealized changes in fair value on derivative instruments not designated in hedging relationships related to financing and other treasury-related activities. Unallocated activity also includes the unrealized changes in fair value on our commodity swaps not designated in hedging relationships recorded within cost of goods sold, which are later reclassified when realized to the segment in which the underlying exposure resides. Additionally, only the service cost component of net periodic pension and OPEB cost is reported within each operating segment and all other components remain in Unallocated.\nBusiness Seasonality\nTotal industry volume is sensitive to factors such as weather, holidays, changes in demographics, consumer preferences and certain occasions including major broadcasted or streamed sporting events. Weather conditions consisting of high temperatures and extended periods of warm and dry weather favor increased consumption of our products, while unseasonably cool or wet weather, especially during the summer months, adversely affects our sales volumes and net sales. Consumption of beer in the Americas segment is seasonal, with nearly 37% of financial volume occurring during the months from May through August. In EMEA&APAC, the peak selling seasons typically occur during the summer months and during the Christmas and New Year holiday season. \nRegulation\nOur business is subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions around the world in which we operate. These regulations govern many parts of our operations, including distributor relationships, sales, brewing and transportation, marketing and advertising and environmental issues. Specifically, excise taxes remitted to tax authorities are government-imposed excise taxes on beer which are shown in a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of sales.\nThe U.S. beer business is regulated by federal, state and local governments. To operate our facilities, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from various governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, state alcohol regulatory agencies and state and federal environmental agencies. U.S. governmental entities including state and local jurisdictions also levy taxes and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In 2024, our U.S. business excise taxes on malt beverages were approximately $15 per hectoliter sold on a reported basis. \nIn Canada, provincial governments regulate the production, marketing, distribution, selling and pricing of beer and other alcoholic beverages produced or imported into Canada (including the establishment of minimum prices), and impose commodity taxes, mark-ups and license fees in relation to its production, distribution and sale. In addition, the Canadian federal government regulates the advertising, labeling, quality control, and international trade of beer, and also imposes commodity taxes on both domestically produced and imported beer. Further, certain bilateral and multilateral treaties entered into by the federal government, provincial governments and certain foreign governments, especially within the U.S., affect the Canadian beer industry. In 2024, our Canadian business excise taxes, federal and provincial, were approximately $55 per hectoliter sold on a reported basis.\nMost countries included in our EMEA&APAC segment where we carry out significant brewing or distribution activities are either a member of the European Union (\"EU\") or a current candidate to join the EU, with the exception of the U.K. As such, there are similarities in the regulations that apply to many parts of our EMEA&APAC segment's operations and products, including brewing, food safety, labeling and packaging, marketing and advertising, environmental, health and safety, employment, data protection and regulations. In the U.K., although the regulatory framework for these areas broadly aligns with the EU, there are some differences due to the U.K.'s departure from the EU (\"Brexit\"), particularly in areas such as labeling, marketing, and data protection standards. To operate breweries and conduct our business in these countries, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits and licenses from various governmental agencies. \n7\nTable of \nContent\ns\nAll of the government(s) of each country in which we sell our products in the EMEA&APAC segment levy excise taxes on alcohol beverages. All countries which are members of the EU apply laws on excise taxes that are consistent with EU legislative acts, also known as EU Directives, and use measurements based on either alcohol by volume or Plato degrees. In contrast, the U.K. has established its own excise duty system post-Brexit, which includes specific rates and requirements. Non-EU countries use various taxation methods, including a flat excise rate per volume or methods similar to those used in the EU. In the year ended December 31, 2024, the excise taxes for our EMEA&APAC segment were approximately $46 per hectoliter on a reported basis.\nProducts and Operations\nOur Products\nWe craft and distribute high-quality, innovative beverages with the purpose of uniting people to celebrate all life's moments. We have a diverse portfolio of beloved and iconic owned and partner brands. In addition to offering beers in various price segments, we offer products in various categories like flavored beverages (which includes hard seltzers), craft, spirits and non-alcoholic beverages including energy drinks. We categorize our brands globally for consistency of reporting based on the following price segments: Above Premium, Premium and Economy. For example, our Above Premium classification includes brands that are sold at a price point higher than the market average. Price segment classifications may vary between the Americas and EMEA&APAC segments and the naming conventions and classifications may be different in the various countries that we operate based on local terminology. For example, in our EMEA&APAC segment, brands categorized in the Premium classification such as Carling would be described as core brands in the local market.\nThe following presents the primary brands sold: \nAbove Premium\n \n- Arnold Palmer Spiked*, Aspall Cider, Beck's*, Blue Moon, Blue Run Spirits*, Cobra, Corona Extra*, Coors Original, Five Trail, Heineken*, Leinenkugel's \nbrands\n, Madrí Excepcional, Miller Genuine Draft, Molson Ultra\n, \nPeroni Nastro Azurro*, Pilsner Urquell*, Redd's \nbrands*, \nSharp's, Simply Spiked*, Sol*, Staropramen, Stella Artois*, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer*, Vizzy Hard Seltzer, ZOA Energy*\nPremium\n \n- Bergenbier, Borsodi, Burgasko, Caraiman, Carling, Coors Banquet, Coors Light, Jelen, Kamenitza, Miller Lite, Molson Canadian \nbrands\n, Niksicko, Ožujsko\nEconomy\n - Branik, Icehouse, Keystone, Lowenbrau*, Miller High Life, Milwaukee's Best, Steel Reserve\n* Represents various partner brand agreements with third parties, such as license, distribution, partnership and joint venture agreements. These agreements may only reside in certain geographies and not all markets globally.\nSales and Distribution\nOur go to market strategy differs between geographic regions due to the differences in regulations among those areas. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nIn the U.S., beer is generally distributed through a three-tier system consisting of manufacturers, distributors and retailers. A national network of independent distributors and one Company-owned distributor, Coors Distributing Company, purchases our products and distributes them to on- and off-premise retail accounts. Coors Distributing Company distributed approximately 5% of our total owned and non-owned Americas segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024. Transportation of our products to distributors in the U.S. is primarily contracted through third-party logistics providers and shipped by truckload. Transportation costs for shipping product throughout our network is performed through contracted freight carriers or, if needed, through the spot bidding freight market. In the Americas, we have taken steps to diversify transportation modes to reduce the impact of truck market volatility including shipping via railcar and intermodal shipping containers.\nIn Canada, because provincial governments regulate the beer industry and provincial liquor boards control the distribution and retail sale of alcohol products, distribution strategies and transportation of products vary by province. In 2024, Ontario experienced an expansion of the retail sale of alcoholic beverages. As of the end of October 2024, every eligible convenience, grocery and big-box grocery store in Ontario is now able to sell beer, cider, wine and ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages in addition to the previously allowed retail outlets operated by BRI, government-regulated retail outlets operated by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (\"LCBO\"), approved agents of the LCBO, certain licensed grocery stores, or any bar, restaurant, or tavern licensed by the LCBO to sell alcohol for on-premise consumption. In Québec, beer is distributed to retail outlets directly by each brewer or through approved independent agents. Retail sales for off-premise consumption are made through grocery and convenience stores, as well as government operated outlets operated by the Société des Alcools du Québec, a government corporation in Québec. BDL manages the distribution of our products throughout British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  \n8\nTable of \nContent\ns\nIn Latin America, we use a combination of export models and license agreements to sell \nBlue Moon, Coors Light, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life, Miller Lite \nand other brands. In our export model markets, we export beer from the U.S. and sell it through agreements with independent distributors. In license markets, we have established exclusive licensing agreements with brewers and distributors for the manufacturing and distribution of our products. In certain of our markets, we rely on a combination of these agreements.\nIn the European countries in which we operate, beer is generally distributed through either a two-tier system consisting of manufacturers and retailers, or a three-tier system consisting of manufacturers, distributors and retailers. Distribution activities for both the on- and off-premise channels are conducted primarily by third-party logistics providers. Most of our beer in the U.K. is sold directly to retailers. We have agreements with DHL Supply Chain Limited to provide the distribution of our products throughout the U.K. We utilize several hundred third-party logistics providers across our Central European operations. We also conduct a small amount of secondary distribution in several Central European countries utilizing our own fleet of vehicles. It is also common in the U.K. for brewers to distribute beer, wine, spirits and other products owned and produced by other companies, which we refer to as factored brands, to the on-premise channel. Approximately 18% of our EMEA&APAC segment net sales in 2024 represented factored brands. \nIn addition, we have an agreement with Heineken whereby they sell, market and distribute \nCoors, Carling, Madrí Excepcional \nand other brands\n \nin the Republic of Ireland, as well as agreements with ABI to brew and distribute \nBeck's\n, \nStella Artois \nand \nLowenbrau,\n and to distribute \nHoegaarden\n, \nLeffe\n and \nCorona\n in Central Europe. \nOur operations in Africa, the Middle East and Asia Pacific include markets such as Australia, South Africa and South Korea, with the sale and distribution completed under local license agreements, through the export of our brands from our sites or contract manufacturing with sale through local distributors. \nChannels\nReferences to on- and off-premise sales volumes are sales to retailers, which we believe is a useful data point relative to consumer trends. The on-premise channel includes sales to bars, pubs and restaurants while the off-premise channel includes sales to convenience stores, grocery stores, liquor stores and other retail outlets. Industry channel trends vary by segment. \nWith the onset of the coronavirus pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced a significant adverse impact on the operating results of our Company resulting from the closure of the on-premise channel and increased restrictions which effectively shut down the on-premise channel for various portions of time across the geographies in which we operate. We began to see a progressive return to the on-premise channel at varying degrees across geographies throughout the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2022. By the year ended December 31, 2023, and continuing into the year ended December 31, 2024, we observed a more normalized level of on-premise volume as a percentage of total volume, returning to approximately 16% on-premise in the U.S. and Canada and above 60% on-premise in the U.K., the largest region in our EMEA&APAC segment, largely consistent with pre-pandemic distribution patterns.\nBrewing Raw Materials\nWe use high quality ingredients to brew our products, including hops, water and barley, among others. \nHops used to brew our products are purchased under various contracts from suppliers in the U.S. and Europe primarily sourced from Germany, the U.K., Czech Republic and Slovenia. These contracts vary in length based on market conditions.\nIn the Americas segment, we malt a majority of our production requirements in our Golden, Colorado facility, using barley purchased primarily under annual contracts with independent farmers located predominately in the western U.S. and Canadian Prairies. In addition, to meet our full requirements, we source barley malt from other commercial providers, from which we have a committed supply through 2025. Other brewing adjuncts and other malt and cereal grains are purchased primarily from suppliers in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, we both own and lease water rights, as well as purchase water through local municipalities and communities, to provide for and sustain our brewing operations in the U.S. and Canada.\nIn EMEA&APAC, our malt requirements are sourced from third-party suppliers, with the majority of our brewing materials provided by suppliers based in Europe. We have multiple agreements with various suppliers that cover almost all of our total required malt, with terms through 2027. Adjuncts are purchased under various contracts with local producers, which are typically crop year contracts commencing in October of each year. In EMEA&APAC, water used in the brewing process is sourced through water rights for water wells, river water use or supply contracts with water suppliers. \nIn addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers. We do not currently anticipate future difficulties in accessing water or agricultural products used in our brewing process in the near term.\n9\nTable of \nContent\ns\nPackaging Materials\n \nOur primary packaging materials include aluminum, glass bottles, reusable kegs and casks and recyclable plastic containers. \nIn the Americas segment, a portion of the aluminum cans and ends are purchased from Rocky Mountain Metal Container (\"RMMC\"), our joint venture with Ball Corporation, whose production facilities, which are leased from us, are located near our brewery in Golden, Colorado. We have supply agreements with Ball Corporation and other vendors to purchase aluminum containers in addition to what is supplied from RMMC. \nIn the Americas segment, a portion of the glass bottles are purchased from Rocky Mountain Bottle Company (\"RMBC\"), our joint venture with Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc., whose production facilities, which are leased from us, are located in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. We have supply agreements with Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc., and other vendors for requirements in excess of RMBC's production.\nIn the EMEA&APAC segments, we manage packaging needs through diversified contracts, which have provided a reliable supply of aluminum cans, glass bottles, and kegs. Flexible keg sourcing adapts to annual changes, enhancing supply security without long-term commitments.\nMany of our ingredients, raw materials and commodities for both brewing and packaging are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including commodity swaps and options. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase for materials, we may or may not be able to pass on such increases to our customers. \nSustainability\nThrough our overall business strategy and our sustainability strategy, referred to as \"Our Imprint,\" we have established goals and supporting initiatives for Putting People First and Preserving Our Planet in an attempt to ensure we are good stewards of the assets and resources most important to our business. More information about our strategy and progress can be found in Our Imprint Report, available at www.molsoncoors.com/goals-and-reporting. The information provided on our website (or any other website referred to in this report) is not part of this report and is not incorporated by reference as part of this report. \nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors (\"Board\") is responsible for overseeing and monitoring Our Imprint Strategy, with specific areas of oversight delegated to the committees of the Board. The Board receives regular reports and recommendations from management and the Board committees to help guide our strategy, from goals related to water, packaging and climate change, to initiatives focused on building a strong culture and engagement within our people, our workplace and our marketplace. At the management level, our executive leadership team, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the oversight and the evolution of Our Imprint Strategy. Our Vice President of Sustainability & EHS works closely with the executive leadership team on strategy development, initiative implementation and progress for our environmental sustainability focus areas.\nOur executive leadership team and the chief people and culture officers for the Americas and EMEA&APAC segments are tasked with managing all employment-related matters including recruitment, retention, leadership and development, compensation and benefits planning, succession planning, performance management, and culture and engagement. The Compensation and Human Resource Committee (\"CHR Committee\") of the Board is responsible for establishing and reviewing the overall compensation philosophy of our Company and providing oversight on certain human capital matters and initiatives, including those related to our talent retention and development, leadership development, talent pipeline, programs and systems for performance management, health and safety and our culture and engagement. \nPutting People First\nWe believe that people are the heart of our Company and strive to create a culture where people are encouraged to and feel comfortable to bring their unique perspectives and experiences to drive our business forward. As a global company, we believe we have a responsibility to nurture a workforce that reflects our marketplace, which we believe makes us a better employer, partner and company of choice for our consumers and customers.\n10\nTable of \nContent\ns\nWe have a global and varied workforce, with major employee centers in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Romania. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 16,800 employees within our business globally with approximately 10,300 employees within our Americas segment and 6,500 employees within our EMEA&APAC segment. Approximately 700 of our employees are in our Global Business Services Centers based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Bucharest, Romania. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 28% and 24% of our Americas segment and EMEA&APAC segment workforces, respectively, are represented by trade unions or councils, which are subject to collective bargaining agreements that come due for renegotiation from time to time.\nWe believe fostering a strong culture with a highly engaged workforce is critical to how we operate, from how we work together to how we grow as a company. Related action plans for the Americas and EMEA&APAC segments are expected to be delivered through three key pillars: People, Workplace and Marketplace.\nTo be first choice for our employees, we deploy programs, policies and initiatives to foster a culture of engagement where employees have the opportunity to learn and grow, developing both professionally and personally. Our 2024 initiatives and progress included:\n•\nBusiness Resource Groups\n - In both Americas and EMEA&APAC, we promoted and supported our self-governed employee Business Resource Groups (\"BRGs\") in their work to connect, engage, and develop their members while achieving business and strategic objectives. Our BRGs are supportive to their members and allies and are acknowledged internally and externally for building an inclusive workplace, supporting business growth and member development and enriching the communities in which we do business.\n•\nEmployee Wellbeing\n - We strive to be a provider of meaningful experiences and a safe and healthy workplace for all employees.\n•\nWellness\n - We promote healthy lifestyles across our global enterprise by offering health and insurance benefits and wellness and work/life balance programs that are tailored to employees' needs and culture by work location. In the Americas, employees can participate in our wellness programs that incentivize healthy habits and lifestyles. These resources include connections to virtual healthcare, remote fitness and wellness support, and a free employee assistance program for coping with stress and anxiety. In the EMEA&APAC regions, we drive our employee wellbeing culture through a team made up of regional representatives who coordinate activities focused on the topics based on employee feedback. In 2024, these activities included certain wellness programs, as well as flexible work hours, wellness webinars and challenges, to further emphasize our wellbeing culture. \n•\nHealth & Safety\n - We also promote safe and healthy behaviors at work and home. Our commitment to Health & Safety is focused on preventing workplace incidents and building a strong behavior-based safety culture across our entire workforce through training, our World Class Supply Chain operating system, our values-based leadership development approach and safety moments at the start of many meetings in both our manufacturing facilities and office environments.\n•\nCompensation and Benefits\n - We offer affordable and comprehensive benefits, which we routinely benchmark to try to ensure they are competitive, inclusive, aligned with our company culture and local practices, and allow our employees to meet their individual needs and the needs of their families. Our Total Rewards program in general provides a competitive base salary, incentive plans, health and insurance benefits, a deferred compensation option in certain regions with a potential employer match, paid time off plans, enhanced parental leave policies in many locations, an engaging Wellness Program and an Employee Assistance Program. Our business units comply with applicable parental leave laws and in many cases go further to provide flexible work schedules and extended leave for new parents. We believe our compensation and incentive programs motivate us to ignite growth and help to hold ourselves accountable for living out our values to achieve our short- and long-term goals.\n•\nTalent Development\n - Our aim is to help employees unlock their full potential so they can thrive in their current job and realize new, potential growth opportunities. At Molson Coors, First Choice Learning serves as the global home for development resources to support the unique needs of our employees around the world. First Choice Learning invests in our people through in-person and online training programs, and experiential training opportunities to support employee health and safety, assist in building core competencies, share best practices and develop leadership capabilities. In 2024, we continued to invest in targeted development programs, including one aimed to accelerate the readiness of high potential employees to move into roles of greater scope and complexity. These programs include a blend of classroom training, coaching and mentoring and experiential action learning projects.  \n \n11\nTable of \nContent\ns\n•\nEmployee Engagement\n - We believe that engaging our employees through surveys during the onboarding process and throughout the employee journey provides us with valuable insight into how we can develop our company culture to help ensure that our people feel supported and are able to thrive at our company. We gauge our employees’ sentiments through Employee Experience surveys three times a year in the Americas and yearly in EMEA&APAC. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer regularly hosts question and answer sessions available to all employees. We believe these sessions also help create a company culture where open, honest dialogue is supported and encouraged, and where people are empowered to raise questions and concerns about our business and our culture. \nPreserving the Planet\nWe have a long legacy of commitment to environmental sustainability, dating back to Bill Coors’ pioneering efforts to bring the two-piece aluminum can to market in the late 1950s and implementation of some of the first recycling programs in the U.S. In 2017, we launched Our Imprint goals for climate and water and, in 2019, incorporated our ambition to make our packaging more sustainable. As further detailed in the annual Our Imprint Report, we have several key sustainability focus areas:\n•\nGreenhouse Gas (\"GHG\") Emissions\n – Against our 2016 baseline, our goal is to reduce Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by 50% by the end of 2025 and 65% by the end of 2030 along with a 40% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by the end of 2030 and to achieve net zero emissions (Scope 1, 2 & 3) by at least 2050. We continue to implement energy and water efficiency improvements across our facilities, including a multi-year renovation project of our Golden, Colorado brewery, a renewables contract for our Fort Worth, Texas brewery and a wind-power based power purchase agreement in the U.K. \n•\nWatershed Stewardship\n – In recognition of our important role in our local watersheds, we targeted an overall 22% improvement by the end of 2025 (versus 2016 baseline) in the water-to-product ratio of our breweries producing more than 150,000 hectoliters annually. We collaborate with key partners on watershed management programs to improve the health of the Trinity River Basin watershed in Texas (home of our Fort Worth brewery) and the Upper South Platte River watershed in Colorado (home of our Golden brewery).\n•\nPackaging\n – We aim to use widely recyclable packaging materials such as aluminum cans, glass bottles and fiberboard cartons, and we are working to eliminate polyethylene terephthalate (\"PET\") bottles and single-use plastic rings for our beer brands in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. while our Central & Eastern European operations are on pace to ensuring the PET bottles in those markets contain at least 25% recycled content by the end of 2025 and 30% by the end of 2030.\n•\nAgricultural Practices\n – We work closely with our barley farmers in the U.S. and Canada to test and learn with different growing practices across multiple regions and collect a broad range of data including water consumption. Against our 2016 baseline, by the end of 2025, our goal is to produce the annual barley crop with 10% less water per ton yielded.\nSee the annual Our Imprint Report for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nFor more than two centuries, we have brewed beverages that unite people to celebrate all life’s moments. From our core power brands \nCoors Light, Miller Lite, Coors Banquet, Molson Canadian, Carling\n and \nOžujsko\n to our above premium brands including \nMadrí Excepcional, Staropramen, Blue Moon Belgian White\n and \nLeinenkugel’s Summer Shandy\n, to our economy and value brands like \nMiller High Life\n and \nKeystone Light\n, we produce many beloved and iconic beers. While our Company's history is rooted in beer, we offer a modern portfolio that expands beyond the beer aisle as well, including flavored beverages like \nVizzy Hard Seltzer\n, spirits like \nFive Trail\n whiskey and non-alcoholic beverages. We also have partner brands, such as \nSimply Spiked, ZOA Energy\n, among others, through license, distribution, partnership and joint venture agreements. As a business, our ambition is to be the first choice for our people, our consumers and our customers, and our success depends on our ability to make our products available to meet a wide range of consumer segments and occasions.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is provided to assist in understanding our Company, operations and current business environment and should be considered a supplement to, and read in conjunction with, the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes included within \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, as well as the discussion of our business and related risk factors in \nPart I—Item 1 Business\n and \nPart I—Item 1A Risk Factors\n, respectively. See also \"Cautionary Statement Pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\"\nA discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2023 compared to 2022 has been omitted from this report, but may be found in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2023 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our corporate website at www.molsoncoors.com. \nOur Fiscal Year\nUnless otherwise indicated, (a) all $ amounts are in USD, (b) comparisons are to comparable prior periods and (c) 2024, 2023 and 2022 refers to the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n37\nTable of \nContent\ns\nItems Affecting Reported Results\nItems Affecting the Consolidated Results of Operations\nPurchases of Annuity Contracts\nOn September 26, 2024, we purchased annuity contracts for two of our Canadian pension plans. As a result, on September 30, 2024, we remeasured both pension plans and recorded a total settlement loss of $34.0 million to other pension and postretirement benefit (cost), net in the consolidated statements of operations. See\n \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1\n1\n, \"\nEmployee Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits\n\"\n and \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15, \"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\"\n for further information.\nCobra Beer Partnership, Ltd. Buyout\nIn March 2024, our partner of CBPL exercised a put option under our partnership agreement which required us to acquire the remaining 49.9% ownership interest. We adjusted our NCI by $34.5 million to our best estimate of the redemption value that existed at the time of the put option exercise by increasing our net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and decreasing our net income attributable to MCBC. In addition, we received the final determination of the redemption value in the third quarter of 2024 and as the transaction was considered mandatorily redeemable, we recorded an adjustment of $45.8 million to interest expense in the EMEA&APAC segment. The transaction was finalized on October 21, 2024, resulting in a cash payment of $89 million which was recorded as a cash outflow from financing activities. See further discussion of this transaction in \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"\n.\nItems Affecting the Americas Segment Results of Operations\nZOA Energy\nOn October 31, 2024, we further increased our investment in ZOA bringing our ownership interest to 51%. Upon conversion from equity method accounting to consolidation accounting, we recognized a gain of $77.9 million in other operating income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial \nStatements\n and Supplementary Data, Note 3, \"Investments\"\n for further information.\nWind Down or Sale of Certain U.S. Craft Businesses\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we decided to wind down or sell certain of our U.S. craft businesses and related facilities and recorded employee-related and asset abandonment charges, including accelerated depreciation in excess of normal depreciation of $93.6 million. In addition, we recognized a loss of $41.2 million on the sold businesses. We expect to continue to incur incremental restructuring charges during the first quarter of 2025 through completion of wind down and closure of certain remaining U.S. craft facilities. See\n \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17, \"Other Operating Income (Expense), net\"\n for further information.\nTruss Impairment and Sale\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we recognized an impairment loss of $28.6 million related to the Truss LP (\"Truss\") joint venture asset group of which $12.1 million was attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2023, we sold our controlling interest in Truss and recognized a loss of $11.1 million. These losses were recorded within other operating income (expense), net. See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17, \"Other Operating Income (Expense), net\"\n and \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3, \"Investme\nnts\"\n for further information.\nKeystone Litigation\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we accrued a liability of $56.0 million within MG&A related to probable losses as a result of the ongoing \nKeystone \nlitigation case. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we accrued $2.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, in associated interest related to this accrued liability. See\n Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for further information.\n38\nTable of \nContent\ns\nItems Affecting the EMEA&APAC Segment Results of Operations\nStaropramen Brands Impairment\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded a partial impairment charge of $160.7 million to our indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the \nStaropramen\n family of brands within the EMEA&APAC segment as a result of our annual impairment analysis. See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\"\n for further information.\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and the conflict remains ongoing. As a result, we suspended exports of all our brands to Russia and subsequently terminated the license to produce any of our brands in Russia. While not material to our consolidated net sales, the Russia-Ukraine conflict negatively impacted our EMEA&APAC segment net sales for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. In addition, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has caused a negative impact to the global economy which has impacted our Company, driving further increases to materials and manufacturing expenses. See risk factors related to this conflict at \nPart I.—Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\"\n.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table highlights summarized components of our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

We calculate the impact of foreign exchange by translating our current period local currency results at the average exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior year period during the respective period throughout the year and comparing that amount with the reported amount for the period. The impact of transactional foreign currency gains and losses, including the impact of undesignated foreign currency forwards, is recorded within other non-operating income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nVolume\nFinancial volume represents owned or actively managed brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographic markets (net of returns and allowances), as well as contract brewing, factored non-owned volume and company-owned distribution volume. This metric is presented on a sales-to-wholesalers (\"STW\") basis to reflect the sales from our operations to our direct customers, generally distributors. We believe this metric is important and useful for investors and management because it gives an indication of the amount of beer and adjacent products that we have produced and shipped to customers. This metric excludes royalty volume, which consists of our brands produced and sold under various license and contract brewing agreements. Factored volume in our EMEA&APAC segment is the distribution of beer, wine, spirits and other products owned and produced by other companies to the on-premise channel such as bars and restaurants, which is a common arrangement in the U.K. \nNet sales\nThe following table highlights the drivers of the change in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, (in percentages): \nFinancial Volume\nPrice and Sales Mix\nCurrency\nTotal\nConsolidated net sales\n(5.0)\n%\n4.4 \n%\n— \n%\n(0.6)\n%\nNet sales decreased 0.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year driven by lower financial volumes, partially offset by favorable price and sales mix.\nFinancial volumes decreased 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year, due to lower shipments in the Americas, including lower contract brewing volumes representing almost half of the decline as well as the impact of the macroeconomic environment resulting in industry softness. EMEA&APAC financial volumes also decreased 2.6%.\nPrice and sales mix favorably impacted net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, by 4.4%, primarily due to increased net pricing as well as favorable sales mix for both segments, including as a result of lower contract brewing volumes in the Americas as well as premiumization and favorable channel mix in EMEA&APAC.\nA discussion of currency impacts on net sales is included in the \"Foreign currency impacts on results\" section above.\nCost of goods sold\nWe utilize cost of goods sold per hectoliter, as well as the year over year changes in this metric, as a key metric for analyzing our results. This metric is calculated as cost of goods sold per our consolidated statements of operations divided by financial volume for the respective period. We believe this metric is important and useful for investors and management because it provides an indication of the trends of sales mix and other cost impacts on our cost of goods sold.\n40\nTable of \nContent\ns\nCost of goods sold decreased 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to lower financial volumes, partially offset by higher cost of goods sold per hectoliter. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 1.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to cost inflation related to materials and manufacturing expenses, unfavorable mix driven by lower contract brewing volumes and volume deleverage in the Americas segment, partially offset by favorable changes in our unrealized mark-to-market commodity derivative positions of $133.0 million and cost savings initiatives.\nA discussion of currency impacts on cost of goods sold is included in the \"Foreign currency impacts on results\" section above.\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses\nMG&A expenses decreased 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and lower marketing resulting from cycling higher investment levels in the prior year.\nA discussion of currency impacts on marketing, general and administrative expenses is included in the \"Foreign currency impacts on results\" section above.\nOther operating income (expense), net\nOther operating expense, net improved 59.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year, primarily due to the cycling of a $160.7 million partial impairment charge to our indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the \nStaropramen \nfamily of brands recorded in the prior year as well as a $77.9 million gain recognized upon the consolidation of ZOA in the fourth quarter of 2024, partially offset by the costs incurred related to the wind down and sale of certain U.S. craft businesses and related restructuring costs including accelerated depreciation charges in excess of normal depreciation of $93.6 million as well as a $41.2 million loss on the disposal of the sold businesses. See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17, \"Other Operating Income (Expense), net\"\n for further detail of our other operating income (expense), net.\nTotal non-operating income (expense), net\nTotal non-operating expense, net increased 34.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year primarily due to higher interest expense driven by a $45.8 million adjustment to increase our mandatorily redeemable NCI liability to the final redemption value related to the CBPL buyout recorded in the third quarter of 2024, a settlement loss of $34.0 million recorded as a result of Canadian pension plan annuity purchases and unfavorable transactional foreign currency impacts, partially offset by higher pension and OPEB non-service benefit.\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nEffective tax rate\n23 \n%\n24 \n%\n(198)\n%\nOur effective tax rate decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024\n, \ncompared to the prior year, in part due to the impact of the $77.9 million gain recognized upon the consolidation of ZOA in the fourth quarter of 2024, which is non-taxable. The decrease was partially offset by (i) the $20.0 million increase in valuation allowance that was recorded on deferred tax assets related to the sale of certain U.S. craft businesses in the third quarter of 2024, and (ii) the impact of the $45.8 million increase in the mandatorily redeemable NCI liability of CBPL in the third quarter of 2024, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, was further decreased by the recognition of additional net tax benefit items totaling $12.8 million, as compared to the recognition of additional net tax expense items totaling $10.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOur effective tax rate can be volatile and may change with, among other things, the amount and source of pretax income or loss, our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based compensation, changes in tax laws and the movement of liabilities established pursuant to accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions as statutes of limitations expire, positions are effectively settled or when additional information becomes available. There are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions and other changes to regulatory environments in countries in which we do business that, if enacted, could have an impact on our effective tax rate. \nRefer to \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12, \"Income Tax\"\n for further discussion regarding our effective tax rate.\n41\nTable of \nContent\ns\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the recording of an out of period adjustment in the third quarter 2024 to increase the noncontrolling interest to the best estimate of the redemption value that existed at the time of the put option exercise in March 2024.

Higher other operating expense, net was primarily due to the wind down and sale of certain of our U.S. craft businesses and related restructuring costs, including accelerated depreciation charges in excess of normal depreciation of $93.6 million as well as a $41.2 million loss on the disposal of the sold businesses, partially offset by a $77.9 million gain recognized upon the consolidation of ZOA in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The improvement was primarily due to the cycling of a $160.7 million partial impairment charge to our indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the \nStaropramen\n family of brands recorded in the prior year, increased net pricing, favorable sales mix and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher net interest expense, lower financial volumes and higher MG&A spend. Higher net interest expense was driven by an adjustment of $45.8 million to increase our mandatorily redeemable NCI liability to the final redemption value related to the CBPL buyout in the third quarter of 2024. Higher MG&A spend was due to increased strategic and transformation project costs as well as increased marketing to support our brands and innovations. \nA discussion of currency impacts on income (loss) before income taxes is included in the \"Foreign currency impacts on results\" section above.\nUnallocated Segment\nWe have certain activity that is not allocated to our segments, which has been reflected as Unallocated below. Specifically, Unallocated primarily includes certain financing-related activities such as interest expense and interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances as well as realized and unrealized changes in fair value on derivative instruments not designated in hedging relationships related to financing and other treasury-related activities. Unallocated activity also includes the unrealized changes in fair value on our commodity swaps not designated in hedging relationships recorded within cost of goods sold, which are later reclassified when realized to the segment in which the underlying exposure resides. Additionally, only the service cost component of net periodic pension and OPEB cost is reported within each operating segment, and all other components remain unallocated.\n43\nTable of \nContent\ns\n \nFor the years ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n% Change\nDecember 31, 2023\n% Change\nDecember 31, 2022\n \n(In millions, except percentages)\nCost of goods sold\n$\n32.8 \nN/M\n$\n(93.5)\n(59.3)%\n$\n(229.9)\nGross profit (loss)\n32.8 \nN/M\n(93.5)\n(59.3)%\n(229.9)\nOperating income (loss)\n32.8 \nN/M\n(93.5)\n(59.3)%\n(229.9)\nTotal non-operating income (expense), net\n(198.4)\n10.5 \n%\n(179.6)\n(13.0)%\n(206.5)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n$\n(165.6)\n(39.4)\n%\n$\n(273.1)\n(37.4)%\n$\n(436.4)\nN/M = Not meaningful\nCost of goods sold\nThe unrealized changes in fair value on our commodity derivatives, which are economic hedges, make up substantially all of the activity presented within cost of goods sold in the table above for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\"\n for further information.\nTotal non-operating income (expense), net\nTotal non-operating expense, net increased 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to prior year primarily due to a settlement loss of $34.0 million recorded as a result of Canadian pension plan annuity purchases and lower favorable transactional foreign currency impacts, partially offset by higher pension and OPEB non-service benefits and higher interest income from higher cash balances.\nSee \nPart II - Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11, \"Employee Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits\"\n for further discussion of pension and OPEB.\nFever-Tree Partnership\nEffective February 1, 2025, we obtained exclusive rights via a license agreement to produce, market and sell Fever-Tree products in the U.S. In connection with this agreement, we acquired the shares of the Fever-Tree USA, Inc. entity, with the immaterial acquisition to be accounted for as a business combination and consideration to be allocated primarily to working capital balances. Further, we made an investment of approximately $90 million in Fever-Tree Drinks Plc, a listed entity on the London Stock Exchange (LSE:FEVR). The investment will be accounted for at fair value under ASC 321. We expect to incur certain one-time transition and integration fees related to the transactions over the next several months. The amounts of such fees will be dependent upon the progression of our integration plans.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOverview\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash provided by operating activities and access to external capital. We continue to monitor world events which may create credit or economic challenges that could adversely impact our profit or operating cash flows and our ability to obtain additional liquidity. We currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term and long-term borrowings, when necessary, will be adequate to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, capital expenditures and other obligations for the twelve months subsequent to the date of the issuance of this report and our long-term liquidity requirements. We do not have any restrictions that prevent or limit our ability to declare or pay dividends.\n44\nTable of \nContent\ns\nWhile a significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities are generated within the U.S., our cash balances include cash held outside the U.S. and in currencies other than the USD. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 55% of our cash and cash equivalents were located outside the U.S., largely denominated in foreign currencies. F\nluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and may continue to have a material impact on these foreign cash balances. Cash balances in foreign countries are often subject to additional restrictions. We may, therefore, have difficulties timely repatriating cash held outside the U.S., and such repatriation may be subject to tax. These limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash resources for needs in the U.S. and other countries and may adversely affect our liquidity. To the extent necessary, we accrue for tax consequences on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as they are earned. We may utilize tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. We periodically review and evaluate these plans and strategies, including externally committed and non-committed credit agreements accessible by our Company and each of our operating subsidiaries. We believe these financing arrangements, along with cash flows from operating activities within the U.S., are sufficient to fund our current cash needs in the U.S.\nGuarantor Information\nSEC Registered Securities\nFor purposes of this disclosure, including the tables, \"Parent Issuer\" shall mean MCBC in its capacity as the issuer of the senior notes under the May 2012 Indenture, the July 2016 Indenture and the May 2024 Indenture. \"Subsidiary Guarantors\" shall mean certain Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries reflecting the substantial operations of our Americas segment.\nPursuant to the indenture dated May 3, 2012 (as amended, the \"May 2012 Indenture\"), MCBC issued its outstanding 5.0% senior notes due 2042. Additionally, pursuant to the indenture dated July 7, 2016 (\"July 2016 Indenture\"), MCBC issued its outstanding 3.0% senior notes due 2026, 4.2% senior notes due 2046 and 1.25% senior notes due 2024 (subsequently repaid upon maturity on July 15, 2024). Further, pursuant to the indenture dated May 29, 2024 (\"May 2024 Indenture\"), MCBC issued its outstanding 3.8% senior notes due 2032. The issuances of the senior notes issued under the May 2012 Indenture, the July 2016 Indenture and the May 2024 Indenture were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain subsidiaries of MCBC, which are listed in Exhibit 22 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Subsidiary Guarantors, and together with the Parent Issuer, the \"Obligor Group\"). Each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is 100% owned by the Parent Issuer. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several.\nNone of our other outstanding debt was issued in a transaction that was registered with the SEC, and such other outstanding debt is issued or otherwise generally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Obligor Group or other consolidated subsidiaries of MCBC. These other guarantees are also full and unconditional and joint and several.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the senior notes and related guarantees rank pari-passu with all other unsubordinated debt of the Obligor Group and senior to all future subordinated debt of the Obligor Group. The guarantees can be released upon the sale or transfer of a Subsidiary Guarantors' capital stock or substantially all of its assets, or if such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a guarantor under our other outstanding debt.\nSee \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 9, \"Debt\"\n for details of all debt issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2024.\nThe following summarized financial information relates to the Obligor Group as of December 31, 2024, on a combined basis, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances between the Obligor Group, and excluding the investments in and equity in the earnings of any non-guarantor subsidiaries. The balances and transactions with non-guarantor subsidiaries have been separately presented.\n45\nTable of \nContent\ns\nSummarized Financial Information of Obligor Group\nYear ended December 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nNet sales, out of which:\n$\n9,077.4 \nIntercompany sales to non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n104.5 \nGross profit, out of which:\n$\n3,590.2 \nIntercompany net costs from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n(368.3)\nNet interest expense, out of which:\n$\n(170.4)\nIntercompany net interest income from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n31.5 \nIncome before income taxes\n$\n1,338.9 \nNet income\n$\n1,036.2 \nAs of December 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nTotal current assets, out of which:\n$\n1,859.8 \nIntercompany receivables from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n191.6 \nTotal noncurrent assets, out of which:\n$\n23,958.2 \nNoncurrent intercompany notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n3,833.8 \nTotal current liabilities, out of which:\n$\n2,673.9 \nCurrent portion of long-term debt and short-term borrowings\n$\n7.6 \nIntercompany payables due to non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n715.6 \nTotal noncurrent liabilities, out of which:\n$\n8,950.8 \nLong-term debt\n$\n6,063.6 \nNoncurrent intercompany notes payable due to non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n13.2 \nCash Flows and Use of Cash\nOur business historically generates positive operating cash flows each year and our debt maturities are generally of a longer-term nature. See the debt maturity profile graph below or refer to \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 9, \"Debt\"\n for further details of our debt maturity profile. However, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by the risk factors described in \nPart I—Item 1A. Risk Factors\n.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $1,910.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased $168.7 million from $2,079.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the unfavorable timing of working capital, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items. The unfavorable timing of working capital was primarily driven by the timing of cash paid for our payables as well as higher payments in the current year for 2023 annual incentive compensation, partially offset by the timing of cash receipts.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $648.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased $193.7 million from $841.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to cash paid in the prior year for an acquisition and other investing activities, as well as higher proceeds in the current year from the sale of the U.S. craft businesses.\n46\nTable of \nContent\ns\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $1,138.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased $157.0 million from $981.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher Class B common stock share repurchases and a payment to acquire the noncontrolling interest in CBPL, partially offset by lower net debt repayments.\nCapital Resources, including Material Cash Requirements\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $969.3 million, compared to $868.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2023, was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities, as well as the issuance of new EUR 800 million 3.80% senior notes due 2032. This was partially offset by debt repayments, including the repayment of our EUR 800 million 1.25% senior notes which matured in July 2024, capital expenditures, Class B common stock share repurchases, dividend payments and payment to acquire the noncontrolling interest in CBPL. See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n for additional detail.\nThe majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in a variety of highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. These investments are viewed by management as low-risk investments on which there are little to no restrictions regarding our ability to access the underlying cash to fund our operations as necessary. While we have some investments in prime money market funds at times, these are classified as cash and cash equivalents; however, we continually monitor the need for reclassification under the SEC requirements for money market funds, and the potential that the shares of such funds could have a net asset value of less than one dollar. We also utilize cash pooling arrangements to facilitate the access to cash across our geographies.\nWorking Capital \nWe actively manage our working capital to ensure we are able to meet our short-term obligations and to provide more favorable timing of cash inflows. These efforts include optimizing our inventory levels and managing our payment terms on accounts payable and accounts receivable.\nBorrowings\nWe repaid our EUR 800 million 1.25% senior notes upon their maturity on July 15, 2024, using the cash proceeds from our EUR 800 million 3.80% senior notes issued on May 29, 2024, and cash on hand. Refer to \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 9, \"Debt\"\n for details.\n47\nTable of \nContent\ns\n                                           \nBased on the credit profile of our lenders that are party to our credit facilities, we are confident in our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if the need arises. On June 3, 2024, we amended our existing $2.0 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date from June 26, 2028 to June 26, 2029. As of December 31, 2024, we had $2.0 billion available to draw on our amended and restated $2.0 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, we had no borrowings drawn on this amended and restated multi-currency revolving credit facility and no commercial paper borrowings.\nWe intend to further utilize our cross-border, cross currency cash pool as well as our commercial paper programs for liquidity as needed. We also have CAD, GBP and USD overdraft facilities across several banks should we need additional short-term liquidity.  \n48\nTable of \nContent\ns\nUnder the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. These include customary events of default and specified representations, warranties and covenants, as well as covenants that restrict our ability to incur certain additional priority indebtedness (certain thresholds of secured consolidated net tangible assets), certain leverage threshold percentages, create or permit liens on assets and restrictions on mergers, acquisitions and certain types of sale lease-back transactions. \n The maximum net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined by the amended and restated multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement, was 4.00x as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these restrictions and covenants, have met such financial ratios and have met all debt payment obligations. All of our outstanding senior notes as of December 31, 2024, rank pari-passu. \nSee \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 9, \"Debt\"\n for further discussion of our borrowings and available sources of borrowings, including lines of credit.\nGuarantees\nWe guarantee indebtedness and other obligations to banks and other third parties for some of our equity method investments and consolidated subsidiaries. Guarantees of the outstanding third-party debt of our equity method investments, which are classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets, have been excluded from the material cash requirements table below. See\n Part II - Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3, \"Investments\"\n and \nPart II - Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for further discussion.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations\nA summary of our material cash requirements from our contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024, based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, is as follows.\n \nPayments due by period\n \nTotal\n2025\n2026-2027\n2028-2029\n2030 and thereafter\n \n(In millions)\nDebt obligations excluding finance leases\n$\n6,117.5 \n$\n20.4 \n$\n2,364.1 \n$\n2.2 \n$\n3,730.8 \nInterest payments on debt obligations\n3,021.4 \n234.0 \n396.1 \n324.2 \n2,067.1 \nFinance leases\n85.2 \n13.0 \n25.9 \n16.3 \n30.0 \nRetirement plan expenditures\n(1)\n368.5 \n41.3 \n74.7 \n74.0 \n178.5 \nOperating leases\n252.3 \n52.7 \n79.1 \n40.9 \n79.6 \nOther long-term obligations\n(2)\n1,773.4 \n394.3 \n622.3 \n387.1 \n369.7 \nTotal obligations\n$\n11,618.3 \n$\n755.7 \n$\n3,562.2 \n$\n844.7 \n$\n6,455.7 \nSee Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, \nNote 9, \"Debt,\n\"\n \nNote 8, \"Leases\n,\n\"\n \nNote 11, \"Employee Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits,\"\n \nNote 10, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,\"\n and \nNote 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for additional information. \n(1)\nPrimarily represents expected benefit payments under our OPEB plans through 2033.

Our short-term credit ratings are A-2, Prime-2 and R-2, respectively. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and it may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the applicable rating agency.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe incurred $720.8 million, and paid $674.1 million, for capital improvement projects worldwide for the year ended December 31, 2024, excluding capital spending by equity method joint ventures, representing an increase of $32.2 million from the $688.6 million of capital expenditures incurred for the year ended December 31, 2023. We continue to focus on where and how we employ our planned capital expenditures, with an emphasis on obtaining required returns on invested capital as we determine how to best allocate cash within the business.\nContingencies\nWe are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, environmental litigation and indemnities associated with our sale of Kaiser to FEMSA. See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for further discussion. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nRefer to \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any other material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make judgments and estimates that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. We review the underlying factors used in our estimates regularly, including reviewing the significant accounting policies impacting the estimates, to ensure compliance with U.S. GAAP. However, due to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates, actual results may be materially different. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to understanding and evaluating the financial results reported in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"\n.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nOur defined benefit pension plans cover certain current and former employees in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Benefit accruals for the majority of employees in our U.S. and U.K. plans have been frozen and the plans are closed to new entrants. In the U.S., we also participate in, and make contributions to, multi-employer pension plans. Further, our OPEB plans provide medical benefits for retirees and their eligible dependents as well as life insurance and, in some cases, dental and vision coverage, for certain retirees in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The defined benefit pension plans are primarily funded, but all OPEB plans are unfunded. We also offer defined contribution plans in each of our segments. \n50\nTable of \nContent\ns\nAccounting for pension and OPEB plans requires that we make assumptions that involve considerable judgment which are significant inputs in the actuarial models that measure our net pension and OPEB obligations and ultimately impact our earnings. These include the discount rate, long-term expected rate of return on assets, and plan asset fair value determination, which are important assumptions used in determining the plans' funded status and annual net periodic pension and OPEB costs. Further assumptions include inflation considerations and health care cost trends. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. We also, with the help of actuaries, periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our net pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related expense. The following discussion focuses on assumptions that are deemed to have the most material impact on our pension and OPEB liabilities and net periodic benefit cost.\nDiscount Rates\nThe assumed discount rates are used to present value future benefit obligations based on each plan's respective estimated duration. Our pension and OPEB discount rates are based on our annual evaluation of high quality corporate bonds in various markets based on appropriate indices and actuarial guidance. We believe that our discount rate assumptions are appropriate; however, significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and OPEB obligations and related expense.\nAs of December 31, 2024, on a weighted-average basis, the discount rates used were 5.41% for our defined benefit pension plans and 5.15% for our OPEB plans. The change from the weighted-average discount rates of 4.74% for our defined benefit pension plans and 4.64% for our OPEB plans as of December 31, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in interest rates in 2024, particularly for our U.S. and U.K. plans.\nA 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumptions would have had the following effects on the projected benefit obligation balances as of December 31, 2024, for our pension and OPEB plans:\nDecrease in discount rate\nIncrease in discount rate\n(In millions)\nUnfavorable (favorable) impact to projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024\nPension obligation\n$\n119.2 \n$\n(109.1)\nOPEB obligation\n16.6 \n(16.3)\nTotal impact to the projected benefit obligation\n$\n135.8 \n$\n(125.4)\nOur U.K. pension plan includes benefits linked to inflation. The above sensitivity analysis does not consider the implications to inflation resulting from the above contemplated discount rate changes. This sensitivity holds all other assumptions constant. \nLong-Term Expected Rate of Return on Assets\nThe assumed long-term expected return on assets is used to estimate the actual return that will occur on each individual funded plan's respective plan assets in the upcoming year. We determine each plan's EROA with substantial input from independent investment specialists, including our actuaries and our outsourced investment consultants. In developing each plan's EROA, we consider current and expected asset allocations, historical market rates as well as historical and expected returns on each plan's individual asset classes. In developing future return expectations for each of our plan's assets, we evaluate general market trends as well as key elements of asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, yields and spreads. The calculation includes inputs for interest, inflation, credit and risk premium (active investment management) rates and fees paid to service providers. Based on the above factors and expected asset allocations, we have assumed, on a weighted-average basis, an EROA of 5.70% for our defined benefit pension plan assets for cost recognition in 2025. This is an increase from the weighted-average rate of 5.47% we assumed for 2024, primarily due to the increase in interest rates in 2024 causing higher expected future fixed income returns. We believe that our EROA assumptions are appropriate; however, significant changes in our assumptions or actual returns that differ significantly from estimated returns may materially affect our net periodic pension costs.\n51\nTable of \nContent\ns\nA 50 basis point change in our EROA assumptions made at the beginning of 2024 would have had the following effects on 2024 net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs.\n \nDecrease in EROA\nIncrease in EROA\n \n(In millions)\n(Unfavorable) favorable impact to the 2024 net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost\n$\n(13.9)\n$\n13.9 \nFair Value of Plan Assets\nThe fair value of plan assets is determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in selecting an appropriate methodology and interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value, especially in the absence of quoted market values in an active market. Changes in these assumptions or the use of different market inputs may have a material impact on the estimated fair values or the ultimate amount at which the plan assets are available to satisfy our plan obligations. \nHealth Care Cost Trend Rates\nThe assumed health care cost trend rates represent the rates at which health care costs are assumed to increase and are based on actuarial input and consideration of historical and expected experience. We use these trends as a significant assumption in determining our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care will impact this trend rate. An increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense of our postretirement health care plan. We believe that our health care cost trend rate assumptions are appropriate; however, significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our postretirement benefit obligations and related costs. As of December 31, 2024, the health care trend rates used were ranging ratably from 7.00% in 2025 to 3.57% in 2040, which is a slight increase from our assumed health care trend rates ranging ratably from 6.75% in 2024 to 3.57% in 2040 as of December 31, 2023. See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11, \"Employee Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits\"\n for further information.\nContingencies, Environmental and Litigation Reserves\nContingencies, environmental and litigation reserves are recorded when probable, using our best estimate of loss. These estimates involve significant judgment and are based on an evaluation of the range of loss related to such matters and where the amount and range can be reasonably estimated. These matters are generally resolved over a number of years and only when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Following our initial determination, we regularly reassess and revise the potential liability related to any pending matters as new information becomes available. Unless capitalization is allowed or required by U.S. GAAP, environmental and legal costs are expensed when incurred. We disclose pending loss contingencies when the loss is deemed reasonably possible, which requires significant judgment. As a result of the inherent uncertainty of these matters, the ultimate conclusion and actual cost of settlement may materially differ from our estimates. We recognize contingent gains upon the determination that realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt, regardless of the perceived probability of a favorable outcome prior to achieving that assurance. In the instance of gain contingencies resulting from favorable litigation, due to the numerous uncertainties inherent in a legal proceeding, gain contingencies resulting from legal settlements are not recognized in income until cash or other forms of payment are received. If significant and probable, we disclose as appropriate.\nSee \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for a discussion of our contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves as of December 31, 2024.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Valuation\nWe evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that may indicate potential impairment. Our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is performed as of October 1, the first day of the last fiscal quarter. We evaluate our other definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when evidence exists that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in such impairment evaluations. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets were approximately $5.6 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively, with the goodwill balance entirely attributed to the Americas reporting unit.  \n52\nTable of \nContent\ns\nWe use a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market approaches to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units and an excess earnings approach to determine the fair values of our indefinite-lived brand intangible assets. Our discounted cash flow projections include assumptions for growth rates for sales, costs and profits, which are based on various long-range financial and operational plans of each reporting unit or each indefinite-lived intangible asset. Additionally, discount rates used in our goodwill analysis are based on weighted-average cost of capital, driven by the prevailing interest rates in geographies where these businesses operate, as well as the credit ratings, financing abilities and opportunities of each reporting unit, among other factors. Discount rates for the indefinite-lived intangible analysis by brand largely reflect the rates supporting the overall reporting unit valuation but may differ to adjust for country or market specific risk associated with a particular brand, among other factors. Our market-based valuations utilize earnings multiples of comparable public companies, which are reflective of the market in which each respective reporting unit operates. The key assumptions used to derive the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets represent Level 3 measurements.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows, specifically, an inability to execute on our strategic initiatives including our premiumization efforts or an increase in costs driven by inflation or other factors that could significantly impact our immediate and long range results, prolonged weakness in consumer demand or other competitive pressures adversely affecting our long-term volume trends, changes in trends and consumer preferences within the industry towards other brands or product categories, unfavorable working capital changes or an inability to successfully implement our cost savings initiatives, (ii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions that significantly differ from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a global pandemic, recession or evolving beer industry), (iii) significant unfavorable changes in tax rates, (iv) volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country-specific factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital, (v) sensitivity to market multiples; and (vi) regulation limiting or banning the manufacturing, distribution or sale of alcoholic beverages.  \nIf actual performance results differ significantly from our projections or we experience significant fluctuations in our other assumptions, a material impairment loss may occur in the future. See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\"\n for further discussion and presentation of these amounts.\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Test\nAs of the October 1, 2024, testing date, the fair value of the Americas reporting unit was determined to be in excess of its carrying amount and therefore no goodwill impairment charge was recorded. The Americas reporting unit continues to be at a heightened risk of future impairment as the fair value exceeded its respective carrying value by less than 15%. The fair value of the Americas reporting unit decreased during the current year, primarily due to lower market multiples and lower forecasted cash flow projections, with the decreases largely driven by more challenging U.S. industry expectations. This is partially offset by a decrease to the discount rate as a result of reductions in the interest rate environment. Specifically, the discount rate used in developing our annual fair value estimates for the Americas reporting unit in the current year was 8.25% based on market-specific factors, as compared to 9.00% used as of the October 1, 2023, annual testing date. A 50 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption, holding all other assumptions and inputs constant, would not have resulted in an impairment of the Americas reporting unit.\nCurrent projections used for the Americas reporting unit testing reflected growth assumptions associated with our continued plan to consistently grow our core power brand revenue, aggressively premiumize our portfolio, scale and expand beyond beer, invest in our capabilities and invest in our people, communities and planet, all of which are intended to benefit the projected cash flows of the business. While progress has been made on this strategy, including the strengthening of our core brands, there is not enough historical data yet to adequately predict future impacts and forecasted future cash flows are inherently at risk given that the strategies are still in progress. In addition, while we have included in our forecasted future cash flows estimates for expected cost inflation and adjusted our volumes to be reflective of the current beer industry trends, there is still inherent risk in achieving our goals. If our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that further impairment charges may be recorded in the future. \n53\nTable of \nContent\ns\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nThe fair values of the \nCoors \nbrands in the Americas (inclusive of our \nCoors\n brand in the U.S. and \nCoors\n distribution agreement in Canada), the \nMiller \nbrands in the U.S., the \nCarling \nbrands in the U.K. and the \nStaropramen \nbrands in EMEA&APAC are sufficiently in excess of their respective carrying values as of the October 1, 2024 annual testing date, with each having over 15% cushion of fair value over book value. We utilize Level 3 fair value measurements in our impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. The future cash flows used in the analyses are based on internal cash flow projections utilizing our long range plans and include significant assumptions by management. A 50 basis point increase in our discount rate assumptions would not have resulted in an impairment of any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nAs of the October 1, 2023, testing date, the carrying value of the \nStaropramen\n family of\n \nbrands in EMEA&APAC was determined to be in excess of its fair value such that a partial impairment loss of $160.7 million was recorded in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2023. \nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe continuously monitor the performance of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets for potential triggering events suggesting an impairment review should be performed or useful lives should be re-assessed. Due to a reduction in forecasted cash flows associated with one of our asset groups, we identified this as a triggering event during the fourth quarter of 2024 and performed a recoverability test for the long-lived assets at the asset group level but concluded that the recoverability test passed and no impairment was recorded. No other material triggering events were identified in either 2024 or 2023 related to our definite-lived intangible assets or other definite-lived assets. \nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgment is required in determining our consolidated provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities.\nWe are periodically subject to income tax audits in various foreign and domestic jurisdictions, which can involve questions regarding our tax positions and result in additional income tax liabilities assessed against us. Settlement of any challenge resulting from these tax controversies can result in a variety of resolutions including no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits. We measure and record the tax benefits from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our estimated liabilities related to these matters are adjusted in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations for examination expires or when additional information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits requires the use of assumptions and significant judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates made are reasonable, actual results could differ and resulting adjustments could materially affect our effective tax rate and tax provision.\nWhen cash is available after satisfying working capital needs and all other business obligations, we may distribute current earnings and the associated cash from a foreign subsidiary to its U.S. parent, and record the tax impact associated with the distribution. However, to the extent current earnings of our foreign operations exist and are not otherwise distributed or planned to be distributed, such earnings accumulate. These accumulated earnings are not considered permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. The taxes associated with any future repatriation of undistributed earnings are anticipated to be insignificant.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, including the reversal of existing temporary differences, historical and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The realization of tax benefits is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. \nThere are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions in which we do business. As discussed in \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12, \"Income Tax\"\n, we recognize the impacts of changes in tax law upon enactment, and therefore, proposed changes in tax law, regulations and rules are not reflected within our tax provision. As a result, such changes may, upon ultimate enactment, result in material impacts to our financial statements.\n54\nTable of \nContent\ns",
