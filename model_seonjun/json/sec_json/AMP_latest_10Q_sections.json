Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 20, 2025 (“2024 10-K”), as well as our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. References below to “Ameriprise Financial,” “Ameriprise,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries.\nOverview\nAmeriprise Financial is a diversified financial services company with a 130-year history of providing financial solutions. We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $1.7 trillion in assets under management, administration and advisement as of September 30, 2025. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients’ financial objectives.\nThe products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. Revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. These factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships.\nWe operate our business in the broader context of the macroeconomic forces around us, including the global and U.S. economies, changes in interest and inflation rates, financial market volatility, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, geopolitical strain, the competitive environment, client and customer activities and preferences, and the various regulatory and legislative developments. Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2024 10-K and other factors as discussed herein.\nEquity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the values of market risk benefits and embedded derivatives associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits and the “spread” income generated on our deposit products, fixed insurance, the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts and fixed deferred annuities. A higher (lower) interest rate environment may result in decreases (increases) to our long-duration contract reserves, which may impact our adjusted operating earnings after tax. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nIn the third quarter, we conducted our annual review of life insurance, annuity and long term care (“LTC”) valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. These annual assumption updates, including model changes, are collectively referred to as unlocking throughout this document. See our Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations sections for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking.\nWe consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in Net investment income. We include the fees from these entities in the Management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment. \nWhile our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that adjusted operating earnings measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of reinsurance accrual; the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and universal life (“UL”) insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual; mean reversion related impacts (the impact on variable universal life (“VUL”) products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on the reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves); the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; block transfer reinsurance transaction impact; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from \n75\nIndex\nAMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. \ndiscontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. \nThe market impact on non-traditional long-duration products includes changes in market risk benefits and embedded derivative values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in economic hedge values and unhedged items including the difference between assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and certain policyholder contract elections. The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosure\ns, including the impact on embedded derivative values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of our life insurance subsidiary’s nonperformance spread.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance and available capital on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures.\nIt is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.\nOur financial targets are:\n•\nAdjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and\n•\nAdjusted operating return on equity of over 30%.\nThe following table reconciles our GAAP measures to adjusted operating measures:\n \nPer Diluted Share\nNine Months Ended September 30, \nNine Months Ended September 30, \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n2,555 \n$\n2,330 \n$\n25.83 \n$\n22.53 \nLess Adjustments:\nNet realized investment gains (losses) \n(1)\n(9)\n(9)\n(0.09)\n(0.09)\nMarket impact on non-traditional long-duration products \n(1)\n(323)\n(322)\n(3.27)\n(3.11)\nMean reversion related impacts \n(1)\n1 \n1 \n0.01 \n0.01 \nNet income (loss) attributable to CIEs\n1 \n3 \n0.01 \n0.03 \nTax effect of adjustments \n(2)\n70 \n69 \n0.71 \n0.66 \nAdjusted operating earnings\n$\n2,815 \n$\n2,588 \n$\n28.46 \n$\n25.03 \nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\n \n \n \n \nBasic\n97.4 \n101.6 \n \n \nDiluted\n98.9 \n103.4 \n \n \n(1) \nPretax adjusted operating adjustments.\n(2) \nCalculated using the statutory federal tax rate of 21%.\n76\nIndex\nAMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. \nThe following table reconciles the trailing twelve months’ sum of net income to adjusted operating earnings and the five-point average of quarter-end equity to adjusted operating equity:\n \nTwelve Months Ended September 30, \n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nNet income\n$\n3,626 \n$\n2,707 \nLess: Adjustments \n(1)\n(136)\n(642)\nAdjusted operating earnings\n3,762 \n3,349 \nTotal Ameriprise Financial, Inc. shareholders’ equity\n5,781 \n4,828 \nLess: AOCI, net of tax\n(1,347)\n(1,926)\nTotal Ameriprise Financial, Inc. shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI\n7,128 \n6,754 \nLess: Equity impacts attributable to CIEs\n— \n(3)\nAdjusted operating equity\n$\n7,128 \n$\n6,757 \nReturn on equity, excluding AOCI\n50.9 \n%\n40.1 \n%\nAdjusted operating return on equity, excluding AOCI \n(2)\n52.8 \n%\n49.6 \n%\n(1) \nAdjustments reflect the sum of after-tax net realized investment gains or losses, net of the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and related reinsurance accrual; mean reversion related impacts; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; block transfer reinsurance transaction impacts; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and net income (loss) from consolidated investment entities.

After-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 21%.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical Accounting Estimates” in our 2024 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEconomic Environment\nGlobal equity market conditions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.

AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. \nAssets under administration include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assets under administration also include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries.\nAssets under advisement include assets for which we provide advisory services such as model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.\nThe following table presents detail regarding our Assets Under Management, Administration and Advisement:\nSeptember 30, \nChange\n2025\n2024\n(in billions)\nAssets Under Management, Administration and Advisement\nAdvice & Wealth Management AUM\n$\n646.4 \n$\n565.2 \n$\n81.2 \n14 \n%\nAsset Management AUM\n674.7 \n672.1 \n2.6 \n— \nCorporate AUM\n0.8 \n0.5 \n0.3 \n60 \nEliminations\n(47.8)\n(45.9)\n(1.9)\n(4)\nTotal Assets Under Management\n1,274.1 \n1,191.9 \n82.2 \n7 \nTotal Assets Under Administration\n347.9 \n314.2 \n33.7 \n11 \nTotal Assets Under Advisement (net of eliminations)\n37.5 \n31.9 \n5.6 \n18 \nTotal Assets Under Management, Administration and Advisement\n$\n1,659.5 \n$\n1,538.0 \n$\n121.5 \n8 \n%\nTotal AUM increased $82.2 billion, or 7%, to $1.3 trillion as of September 30, 2025 compared to $1.2 trillion as of September 30, 2024 due to an $81.2 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by equity market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, and a $2.6 billion increase in Asset Management AUM primarily driven by equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Total Assets Under Administration increased $33.7 billion, or 11%, to $347.9 billion as of September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily driven by equity market appreciation and an increase in third-party money market funds. Total Assets Under Advisement increased $5.6 billion, or 18%, to $37.5 billion as September 30, 2025 due to net inflows and market appreciation.

The following impacts were significant drivers of the period-over-period change in pretax income:\n•\nThe market impact on non-traditional long duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual was an expense of $82 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to an expense of $402 million for the prior year period. \n•\nA favorable impact from higher average equity markets compared to the prior year period. Our average WEI, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, increased 15% in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period. \n•\nThe favorable impact from the cumulative impact of wrap net inflows.\n•\nThe favorable impact of unlocking was $22 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to an unfavorable impact of $77 million for the prior year period.\n•\nAn unfavorable impact from the cumulative impact of Asset Management net outflows. \n79\nIndex\nAMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. \nThe following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking for the three months ended September 30:\nPretax Increase (Decrease)\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nPremiums, policy and contract charges\n$\n118 \n$\n(4)\nOther revenues\n3 \n— \nTotal revenues\n121 \n(4)\nInterest credited to fixed accounts\n(21)\n(10)\nBenefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses\n16 \n(4)\nRemeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves:\nLTC unlocking\n26 \n4 \nUnlocking impact, excluding LTC\n(10)\n(24)\nTotal remeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves\n16 \n(20)\nChange in fair value of market risk benefits\n88 \n107 \nTotal expenses\n99 \n73 \nPretax income (loss) \n(1)\n$\n22 \n$\n(77)\n(1)\n Includes a $28 million net expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and a $17 million net expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to the market impact on IUL benefits, which are excluded from adjusted operating earnings. Refer to Results of Operations by Segment for the impact to pretax adjusted operating earnings attributable to unlocking.\nThe primary drivers of the unlocking impact for the three months ended September 30, 2025 included net unfavorable changes to variable annuity surrender and utilization assumptions, net unfavorable changes in LTC morbidity and mortality assumptions, favorable claims incidence rates on disability insurance, and net favorable model changes primarily related to cost of reinsurance and index credits associated with non-traditional insurance products. In the prior year period, the primary driver of the unlocking impact was lowered surrender assumptions on variable annuities with living benefits resulting in an expense, partially offset by the updated claims incident rates on disability insurance.\nNet Revenues\nManagement and financial advice fees increased $238 million, or 9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period reflecting market appreciation and continued wrap account net inflows, partially offset by the cumulative impact of Asset Management net outflows.\nPremiums, policy and contract charges increased $84 million, or 21%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to model changes related to the cost of reinsurance associated with non-traditional insurance products, partially offset by lower sales of life contingent payout annuities. \nBanking and deposit interest expense decreased $61 million, or 37%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting lower balances and lower average crediting rates on certificates and lower average crediting rates on Ameriprise Bank, FSB (“Ameriprise Bank”) cash deposits. \nExpenses\nDistribution expenses increased $175 million, or 11%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting higher advisor compensation from higher average wrap account assets. \nInterest credited to fixed accounts increased $23 million, or 19%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting a $24 million increase in expense from other market impacts on indexed universal life (“IUL”) benefits, net of hedges, which was a benefit of $11 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to a benefit of $35 million for the prior year period. The increase in expense was primarily due to a decrease in the IUL embedded derivative in the prior period, which reflected lower option costs due to a lower new money rate, offset by less discounting due to lower forward rates.\nBenefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $87 million, or 20%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting a $91 million decrease in expense from market impacts on  structured variable annuities (“SVA”) embedded derivative, net of hedging activity. This decrease was primarily the result of a favorable $557 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the SVA embedded derivative and an unfavorable $466 million change in the market impact on SVA embedded derivative. The decrease in expense also reflects the impact of lower sales of life contingent payout annuities, partially offset by the impact of increased volume in SVAs.\n80\nIndex\nAMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. \nRemeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves increased $44 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period reflecting the unfavorable impact of unlocking in the current period compared to a favorable impact of unlocking for the prior year period. \nChange in fair value of market risk benefits decreased $264 million, or 47%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:\n•\nA $265 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges. This decrease was the result of a favorable $779 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits reserves, partially offset by an unfavorable $514 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:\n•\nEquity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a larger benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period.\n•\nInterest rate and bond impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period.\n•\nVolatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to a benefit in the prior year period.\n•\nOther unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a larger net expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $24 million, or 2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to ongoing benefits from our initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and effectiveness, partially offset by higher volume related expenses and investments for business growth.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 22.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 20.7% for the prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher pretax income in the current period compared to the prior year period and the related impact on tax preferred items.

Peer groupings of Threadneedle funds are defined by either IA or Morningstar index and are based on the Primary Share Class. Comparison to Index are measured gross of fees.\nTo calculate asset weighted performance, the sum of the total assets of the funds with above median ranking are divided by total assets of all funds. Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.\nAggregated Asset Allocation Funds may include funds that invest in other Columbia or Threadneedle branded mutual funds included in both equity and fixed income.\n(2)\n Columbia funds are available for purchase by U.S. customers. Out of 89 Columbia funds rated (based on primary share class), 1 received a 5-star Overall Rating and 46 received a 4-star Overall Rating. Out of 134 Threadneedle funds rated (based on highest-rated share class), 11 received a 5-star Overall Rating and 46 received a 4-star Overall Rating.

The decrease in expense was primarily due to a decrease in the IUL embedded derivative in the current period, which reflected more discounting due to higher forward rates.\n•\nA $6 million decrease in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to an unfavorable impact of $17 million for the prior year period.\nBenefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $75 million, or 7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting a $46 million decrease in expense from market impacts on SVA embedded derivative, net of hedging activity. This decrease was primarily the result of a favorable $137 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the SVA embedded derivative and an unfavorable $91 million change in the market impact on SVA embedded derivative. This decrease also reflects the impact of lower sales of life contingent payout annuities, partially offset by the impact of increased volume in SVAs.\nRemeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves increased $43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period reflecting the unfavorable impact of unlocking in the current period compared to a favorable impact of unlocking for the prior year period.\nChange in fair value of market risk benefits increased $131 million, or 20%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items:\n•\nA $106 million increase in expense from market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges. This increase was the result of an unfavorable $550 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits reserves and a favorable $444 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:\n•\nEquity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period.\n•\nInterest rate and bond impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a larger expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period.\n•\nVolatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period.\n•\nOther unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a lower net expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $78 million, or 3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting ongoing benefits from our initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and effectiveness, lower severance expenses, partially offset by higher volume related expenses and investments for business growth. \nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 20.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 20.0% for the prior year period.

financial advice fees decreased $14 million, or 2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the impact from variable annuity net outflows, partially offset by market appreciation. \nNet investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, increased $141 million, or 18%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to increased SVA balances and higher investment portfolio yields from investment portfolio repositioning.\nPremiums, policy and contract charges increased $33 million, or 3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to model changes related to the cost of reinsurance associated with

SVA indexed account embedded derivative (net of hedges) and mean reversion related impacts, decreased $27 million, or 4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of lower sales of life contingent payout annuities and favorable life claims, partially offset by increased volume in SVAs. \nRemeasurement (gains) losses of future

not considered discontinued operations, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss decreased $39 million, or 11%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period.\nLTC insurance had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to pretax adjusted operating earnings of $37 million for the prior year period primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking and lower investment portfolio yields.\nThe FA business had a pretax adjusted operating loss of $21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to a pretax adjusted operating loss of $21 million for the prior year period.  \nNet Revenues\nNet investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate and currency changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs, decreased $8 million, or 5%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting lower investment portfolio yields, partially offset by a benefit in our affordable housing partnerships.\nOther revenues decreased $9 million, or 6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the yield on deposit receivables arising from reinsurance transactions.\nExpenses\nRemeasurement (gains) losses of future policy benefit reserves increased $30 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the net unfavorable unlocking changes in LTC morbidity and mortality assumptions.\nGeneral and administrative expense, which excludes integration and restructuring charges, decreased $75 million, or 26%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting lower severance expenses associated with our initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and unfavorable mark-to-market impacts on share-based compensation in the prior year period.\n97\nIndex\nAMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. \nFair Value Measurements\nWe report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, market risk benefits, embedded derivatives, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.\nFair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk\nCompanies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our market risk benefits, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of market risk benefits, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for risk, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of September 30, 2025. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase, respectively. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the U.S. Treasury curve, the reduction to future total equity would be approximately $467 million, net of the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on September 30, 2025 credit spreads.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe maintained substantial liquidity during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had $9.6 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs and other restricted cash on a consolidated basis. \nAs of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the parent company had $1.3 billion and $856 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents, and unencumbered liquid securities. Liquid securities predominantly include U.S. government agency mortgage backed securities. Additional sources of liquidity at the parent company include a line of credit with an affiliate up to $750 million and an unsecured revolving committed credit facility for up to $1.0 billion that expires in November 2029. Management’s estimate of liquidity available to the parent company in a volatile and uncertain economic environment as of September 30, 2025 was $2.5 billion which includes cash, cash equivalents, unencumbered liquid securities, the line of credit with an affiliate and a portion of the committed credit facility.\nUnder the terms of the committed credit facility, we can increase the availability to $1.3 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At September 30, 2025, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of letters of credit issued against the facility. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We remained in compliance with all such covenants at September 30, 2025.\nIn addition, we have access to collateralized borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, and advances at the Federal Reserve. Our subsidiaries, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), and Ameriprise Bank are members of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had $11.7 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively, of estimated borrowing capacity under the FHLB facilities, of which $201 million was outstanding as of both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, and is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities. In addition, Ameriprise Bank maintains access to borrowings from the Federal Reserve which are collateralized with residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and corporate debt securities. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we estimated $9.3 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively, of borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve in addition to the FHLB capacity and there were no outstanding obligations.\nThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations disclosed in our 2024 10-K.\nOn February 28, 2025, we issued $750 million of 5.2% unsecured senior notes due April 15, 2035.  On April 2, 2025, we repaid $500 million principal amount of our 3.0% senior notes at maturity. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our long-term debt maturities.\n98\nIndex\nAMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. \nWe believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, our availability of internal and external borrowings, access to debt markets, and dividends from our subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term operating liquidity needs and stress requirements.\nIn October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”) issued its final rule establishing a consolidated capital framework termed the “Building Block Approach” (“BBA”) for savings and loan holding companies like Ameriprise Financial that are significantly engaged in insurance activities. For information on the impact of the BBA, see “Business - Regulation - Federal Banking and Financial Holding Company Regulation” included in Part I, Item 1 in our 2024 10-K.\nWe are an applicable corporation required to compute the corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”); however, as of September 30, 2025, based on current estimates, we do not expect to be liable for CAMT in 2025. This estimate is based on interpretations and assumptions of available guidance, including proposed regulations and notices, that we have made regarding the CAMT provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\nIn December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development published the Pillar Two model rules which introduce new taxing mechanisms aimed at ensuring multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax on profits from each jurisdiction in which they operate. As of September 30, 2025, we have not recorded any Pillar Two tax liabilities. As of December 31, 2024, the tax impact was not material to the consolidated financial statements. We continue to monitor the adoption and implementation of these rules and evaluate the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nDividends from Subsidiaries\nAmeriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), Ameriprise Bank, AMPF Holding, LLC, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (“AFS”) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp. (“CMIS”), our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (“CMIA”), TAM UK International Holdings Ltd, which includes Ameriprise International Holdings GmbH within its organizational structure, and Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Ltd. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements. For example, RiverSource Life payments in excess of statutory unassigned funds require advanced notice to the Minnesota Department of Commerce (“MN DOC”), RiverSource Life’s primary regulator, and are subject to potential disapproval. In addition, dividends and other distributions whose fair market value, together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of the previous year’s statutory net gain from operations or 10% of the previous year-end statutory capital and surplus are referred to as “extraordinary dividends.” Extraordinary dividends also require advanced notice to MN DOC, and are subject to potential disapproval.\nOur broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 15c3-1 provides an “alternative net capital requirement” which AEIS and AFS (significant broker dealers) have elected. Regulations require that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $250 thousand or 2% of aggregate debit items arising from client balances. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) may impose certain restrictions, such as restricting withdrawals of equity capital, if a member firm were to fall below a certain threshold or fail to meet minimum net capital requirements.\nAmeriprise Bank is subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in its role as insurer of its deposits. Ameriprise Bank is required to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), Tier 1 Capital to average assets (as defined), and under rules defined under the Basel III capital framework, Common equity Tier 1 capital (“CEIT”) to risk-weighted assets. Ameriprise Bank calculates these ratios under the Basel III standardized approach in order to assess compliance with both regulatory requirements and Ameriprise Bank’s internal capital policies. As permitted under the rules of the Basel III capital framework, we have elected to exclude AOCI from the calculation of regulatory capital.\nACC is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”). ACC markets and sells investment certificates to clients. ACC is subject to various capital requirements under the 1940 Act, laws of the State of Minnesota and understandings with the SEC and the MN DOC. The terms of the investment certificates issued by ACC and the provisions of the 1940 Act also require the maintenance by ACC of qualified assets.\nActual capital and the regulatory capital requirement for TAM UK International Holdings Ltd. and Columbia Threadneedle Investments UK International Ltd. are calculated and reported as a single consolidated group under TAM UK International Holdings Ltd. Required capital for these entities is predominantly based on the requirements specified by its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), under its Capital Adequacy Requirements for investment firms. Required capital reflects 110% of the Own Funds \n99\nIndex\nAMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. \nThreshold Requirement (“OFTR”) and is determined by the group through its ongoing Internal Capital Adequacy and Risk Assessment (“ICARA”) process.\nActual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:\nActual Capital\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\n(in millions)\nRiverSource Life\n (1)\n$\n2,670 \n$\n2,700 \nN/A\n$\n489 \nRiverSource Life of NY\n (1)\n205 \n219 \nN/A\n38 \nACC\n (3)(4)\n510 \n644 \n$\n476 \n596 \nTAM UK International Holdings Ltd.\n (5)\n456 \n692 \n301 \n265 \nAmeriprise Bank\n (6)\n1,872 \n1,763 \n1,209 \n1,199 \nAFS\n (2)(3)\n168 \n113 \n#\n#\nAmeriprise Captive Insurance Company\n (2)\n52 \n36 \n12 \n13 \nAmeriprise Trust Company\n (2)\n82 \n74 \n58 \n51 \nAEIS \n(2)(3)\n164 \n141 \n34 \n30 \nRiverSource Distributors, Inc.\n (2)(3)\n14 \n13 \n#\n#\nColumbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc.\n (2)(3)\n29 \n19 \n#\n#\nN/A  Not applicable as only required to be calculated annually.\n#  Amounts are less than $1 million.\n(1)\n Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis. Regulatory capital requirement is the company action level and is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.\n(2)\n Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n(3)\n Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.\n(4)\n ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the MN DOC and SEC capital requirements.\n(5)\n Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation.\n(6)\n Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with rules defined under Basel III capital framework. As permitted, AOCI is excluded from the calculation of regulatory capital.\nIn addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $2.9 billion (including $450 million from Ameriprise Bank, $500 million from RiverSource Life and $1.3 billion from AMPF Holding, LLC) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $230 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $3.2 billion (including $525 million from Ameriprise Bank, $600 million from RiverSource Life and $1.2 billion from AMPF Holding, LLC) and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $95 million.\nIn 2009, RiverSource Life established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (“GLIC”) for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. GLIC is domiciled in Delaware, so in the event GLIC was subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings, such proceedings would be located in (and governed by) Delaware laws. Delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs as well as contracts among sophisticated parties. Similar credit protections to what we have with GLIC have been tested and respected in Delaware and elsewhere in the United States, and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that GLIC becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in Delaware. Accordingly, while no credit protections are perfect, we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our counterparty credit exposure to GLIC is not the full amount of the gross liability that GLIC reinsures, but a much smaller net exposure to GLIC (if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections). Thus, management believes that our agreement and offsetting non-LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth Financial, Inc. will enable RiverSource Life to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of GLIC.\n100\nIndex\nAMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. \nDividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases\nWe paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $461 million and $444 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. On October 30, 2025, we announced a quarterly dividend of $1.60 per common share. The dividend will be paid on November 24, 2025 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2025.\nOn July 24, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized $3.5 billion for the repurchase of our common stock through September 30, 2025, which was exhausted during the second quarter of 2025. On April 22, 2025, our Board of Directors authorized $4.5 billion for the repurchase of our common stock through June 30, 2027. As of September 30, 2025, we had $3.5 billion remaining under this share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing excess capital, future free cash flow generation and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased a total of 3.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $512.03 per share.\nCash Flows \nCash flows of CIEs and restricted and segregated cash and cash equivalents are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. Cash and cash equivalents segregated under federal and other regulations is held for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers and is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $558 million to $5.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $6.2 billion for the prior year period primarily reflecting higher income taxes paid and net cash outflows related to brokerage deposits.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio and is significantly affected by the net flows of our face amount certificates and bank deposit activity.\nNet cash provided by investing activities decreased $167 million to $65 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $232 million for the prior year period driven by a $273 million increase in purchases of investments by CIEs and a $141 million increase in fundings of mortgage loans partially offset by net cash inflows of $317 million related to maturities, sales and purchases of Available-for-Sale securities.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $579 million to $4.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $3.7 billion for the prior year period. The increase in net cash used in financing activities primarily reflects a $790 million increase in net cash outflows from investing certificates partially offset by net cash inflows of $240 million related to issuance and repayment of long term debt during the current year period.  \nForward-Looking Statements \nThis report contains forward-looking statements that reflect management’s plans, estimates and beliefs.
