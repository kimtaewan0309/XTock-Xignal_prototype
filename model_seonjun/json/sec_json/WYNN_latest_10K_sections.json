  "item1": "Item 1. Business \nOur Company\nWynn Resorts, Limited (\"Wynn Resorts,\" \"Wynn,\" or together with its subsidiaries, \"we\" or the \"Company\") is a preeminent designer, developer, and operator of integrated resorts featuring luxury hotel rooms, high-end retail space, an array of dining and entertainment options, meeting and convention facilities, and gaming, all supported by an unparalleled focus on our guests, our people, and our community. We believe that our extensive design and operational experience across numerous gaming jurisdictions provides us with a distinct advantage over other gaming enterprises.   \nThrough our approximately 72% ownership of Wynn Macau, Limited (\"WML\"), we operate two integrated resorts in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (\"Macau\"), Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau (collectively, our \"Macau Operations\"). In Las Vegas, Nevada, we operate and, with the exception of certain retail space, own 100% of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, which we also refer to as our Las Vegas Operations. In Everett, Massachusetts, we operate Encore Boston Harbor, an integrated resort. Additionally, the Company has a 40% equity interest in Island 3 AMI FZ-LLC, an unconsolidated affiliate, which is constructing an integrated resort property (\"Wynn Al Marjan Island\") in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. \nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all other reports and any amendments of such reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") are available, without charge, at the SEC's website at \nhttp://www.sec.gov\n. In addition, through our corporate website at \nwww.wynnresorts.com\n, Wynn Resorts provides a hyperlink to a third-party SEC filing website which makes available all such reports and amendments as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with, or furnishing to the SEC, without charge. The information found on or linked through our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, nor does it form a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.\nOur Strategy \nWe conceptualize, design, build, and operate our resorts to create unforgettable customer experiences across a diverse set of gaming and non-gaming amenities that attract a wide range of customer segments and generate strong financial results. \nCentral to our strategy is the construction of, and regular reinvestment in, world-class integrated resorts. These activities are led by our in-house design, development, and construction subsidiary and its senior management team, which has significant experience across all major design and construction disciplines. In addition, we believe superior customer service is the best marketing strategy to attract customers and drive repeat visitation to our resorts. Human resources and staff training are essential to ensuring our employees are prepared to provide the luxury service that our guests expect. We have been successful in attracting a wide range of premium guests both domestically and internationally. Part of this strategy includes leveraging our marketing team across various branch offices located internationally to connect and build relationships with our customers. We continually evaluate our offerings and service levels, and as a result, have made and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to our resorts.\nWe plan to continue to seek out new opportunities to develop and operate world-class integrated resorts and related businesses around the world. Overall, we believe Wynn Resorts has a demonstrated track record of developing and operating integrated resorts that stimulate local and regional economic activity, by attracting a wide range of customers (including high-net-worth international tourists), driving international tourism, raising average hotel room rates in the region, extending the average length of stay per visitor, complementing existing convention and meeting business with five-star accommodations and appropriately scaled meeting amenities, elevating service levels with the execution of five-star customer service, and stimulating city-wide investment and employment.\n3 \nTable of Contents\nOur Values\nWynn Resorts thrives in the luxury hospitality industry because of our employees, who exhibit our values at every level within the Company. Our values are embodied by the following concepts:\n•\nService-Driven\n.

Our investments in low-carbon energy, including on-site solar arrays and notably, a 160-acre solar facility in northern Nevada, have earned us a place in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Green Power Partnership. We voluntarily use green power to reduce carbon emissions and drive toward our corporate sustainability goals. We encourage our employees to avail themselves of numerous leadership and development opportunities and use our resources to assist in the education and development of the next generation of employees and leaders. We are also fully committed to supporting our communities in the Las Vegas and Boston areas, through our corporate giving program and through the Wynn Resorts Foundation, which fosters charitable giving and volunteerism among Wynn employees and community partners.\nIn Macau and across the Greater Bay Area, which is the region encompassing Macau, Hong Kong, and southern Guangdong Province, we strive to drive reinvestment in our community, encourage volunteerism, and promote responsible gaming through our Wynn Care program. Since launching this program, we have centralized our community-focused initiatives under one umbrella and meaningfully increased our involvement in various volunteer activities and community events in Macau, the Greater Bay Area, and beyond. We are also fully committed to supporting the sustainable development of Macau and endeavor to provide our guests with a premium experience while remaining environmentally conscious by monitoring and reducing inefficient energy and resource consumption and embracing technologies that help us to responsibly use our resources. In addition, we provide our employees in Macau with numerous professional development and training opportunities to elevate core and leadership skills. \nExecuting on Our Strategy\nReflecting our strategic focus, our values, and our commitment to delivering world-class, five-star service within luxury integrated resorts, the Company has received the following recognition:\n•\nCollectively, Wynn Resorts earned 19 Forbes Travel Guide (\"FTG\") Five-Star awards in 2025 and holds the most FTG Five-Star awards of any independent hotel company in the world.\n4 \nTable of Contents\n•\nWynn Resorts was once again included on FORTUNE Magazine's 2025 World's Most Admired Companies list in the hotel, casino, and resort category.\n•\nWynn Las Vegas has received the distinction of Four Green Globes, the highest achievement for energy-efficient and sustainable buildings from the Green Building Initiative.\n•\nEncore Boston Harbor has been certified LEED Platinum, the U.S. Green Building Council's highest level of certification.\n•\nWynn Palace and Wynn Macau collectively earned 12 FTG Five-Star awards in 2025, with Wynn Palace maintaining its status as the largest FTG Five-Star resort in the world.   \nOur Resorts\nWe present the operating results of our four resorts in the following segments: Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau, Las Vegas Operations, and Encore Boston Harbor. We generally experience fluctuations in revenues and cash flows from month to month, including from such factors as the timing of major conventions and holidays; however, we do not believe that our business is materially impacted by seasonality. \nWynn Palace\nWe opened Wynn Palace in August 2016, on Macau's Cotai Strip, conveniently located minutes from both Macau International Airport and the Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal and directly adjacent to a stop serviced by Macau's light rail system. The property features approximately 468,000 square feet of casino space with 303 table games and 598 slot machines, as well as private gaming salons and sky casinos. Wynn Palace also features a luxury hotel tower with a total of 1,706 guest rooms, suites, and villas, offering a health club, spa, salon, and pool. In addition, Wynn Palace offers 14 food and beverage outlets, approximately 107,000 square feet of high-end, brand-name retail space, and approximately 37,000 square feet of meeting and convention space. The property's signature public attractions and entertainment offerings include a performance lake, an immersive entertainment center, Western and Asian art displays, and a gondola ride offering convenient street-level access. \nWe are in the design stages of developing the next phase of Wynn Palace. We currently expect that the next phase at Wynn Palace will incorporate an array of amenities such as theater and expanded event space, food and beverage features, and other non-gaming offerings.\nWynn Macau\nWe opened Wynn Macau in September 2006, and Encore, an expansion of Wynn Macau, in April 2010. Located in the heart of downtown Macau, the property features\n \napproximately 294,000 square feet of casino space with 257 table games and 696 slot machines, as well as private gaming salons, sky casinos, and a poker room. Wynn Macau also features two luxury hotel towers with a total of 1,010 guest rooms and suites, offering two health clubs, two spas, a salon and a pool. In addition, Wynn Macau offers 12 food and beverage outlets, approximately 64,500 square feet of high-end, brand-name retail space, and approximately 31,000 square feet of meeting and convention space. Wynn Macau's signature attractions include offerings such as the performance lake and a rotunda show featuring a Chinese zodiac-inspired ceiling along with the gold \"tree of prosperity\" show.\nLas Vegas Operations\nWe opened Wynn Las Vegas in April 2005 and Encore, an expansion of Wynn Las Vegas, in December 2008. Wynn Las Vegas is located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, and occupies approximately 215 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip. The property features approximately 195,000 square feet of casino space with 223 table games and 1,577 slot machines, as well as private gaming salons, a sky casino, a poker room, and a race and sports book.

The property features approximately 210,000 square feet of casino space with 172 table games, 24 poker tables and approximately 2,724 slot machines, private and high-limit gaming areas, and a sports book. Encore Boston Harbor also features a luxury hotel tower with a total of 671 guest rooms and suites, which offers a spa and salon. In addition, Encore Boston Harbor offers 16 food and beverage outlets and a nightclub, approximately 8,186 square feet of retail space, and approximately 71,000 square feet of meeting and convention space. Public attractions include a waterfront park, floral displays, and water shuttle service to downtown Boston. \nFuture Development Projects\nIn January 2022, we, along with Island 3 AMI FZ-LLC and RAK HH IR FZ-LLC, announced plans for the development and management of Wynn Al Marjan Island, a destination integrated resort property in the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. Wynn Al Marjan Island, which is currently under construction, is anticipated to be completed and open to the public in 2027, featuring an over 1,500-room hotel, luxury villas, a high-end shopping mall, a state-of-the-art meeting and convention facility, an exclusive spa, more than 20 restaurants and lounges, 225,000 square feet of gaming area, a wide array of entertainment choices including a nightclub and a beach club, and other amenities. The planned integrated resort will leverage Wynn Resorts' expertise in developing and operating luxury hospitality destinations, and is expected to create substantial value to the local economy by accelerating tourism, creating jobs, and contributing to the growth of related sectors. \nMarket and Competition\nThe casino resort industry is highly competitive. We compete with other high-quality resorts on the basis of the range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment, themes and size, among other factors. We seek to differentiate our integrated resorts by delivering superior design and customer service.  \nMacau\nMacau, located in the Greater Bay Area, is governed as a special administrative region of China and is located approximately 37 miles southwest of Hong Kong. The journey between Macau and Hong Kong takes approximately 15 minutes by helicopter, 30 minutes by road via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, and one hour by jetfoil ferry. Macau, which has been a casino destination for more than 60 years, consists principally of a peninsula on mainland China and two neighboring islands, Taipa and Coloane, between which the Cotai area is located. In addition to Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A. (\"Wynn Macau SA\"), SJM Resorts, S.A. (\"SJM\"), Galaxy Casino, S.A. (\"Galaxy\"), Venetian Macau, S.A. (\"Venetian Macau\"), Melco Resorts (Macau) Limited (\"Melco\"), and MGM Grand Paradise Limited (\"MGM Macau\") are permitted to operate casinos in Macau, with a total of 30 casinos currently in operation.\nBoth the Macau gaming market and visitation to Macau grew significantly from liberalization in 2002 up until the outbreak of COVID-19, and then fell meaningfully from early 2020 to December 2022 due to certain border control and other travel related restrictions as a result of the pandemic. Over the course of December 2022 and January 2023, Macau authorities eliminated these COVID-19 related protective measures and the gaming market resumed a period of growth. According to the Macau Statistics and Census Service Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, visitation to Macau in 2024 increased 23.8% and 512.7% and decreased 11.4% as compared to 2023, 2022, and 2019, respectively. \nWe believe that the Macau region hosts one of the world's largest concentrations of potential gaming and tourism customers. According to Macau Statistical Information, annual gaming revenues were $36.5 billion in 2019, before falling to $7.6 billion in 2020, $10.8 billion in 2021, and $5.3 billion in 2022, due to various quarantine measures and travel and entry restrictions and conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19, and increased to $22.7 billion in 2023 and $28.4 billion in 2024, respectively, due to Macau authorities eliminating COVID-19 related protective measures over the course of December 2022 and January 2023. We continue to believe that Macau's stated goal of becoming a world-class tourism destination will continue to drive additional visitation to the market and create future opportunities for us to invest and grow.\nOur Macau Operations face competition primarily from the 28 other casinos located throughout Macau in addition to casinos located throughout the world, including Singapore, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Australia, Las Vegas, cruise ships in Asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout Asia. Additionally, certain other \n6 \nTable of Contents\nAsian countries and regions have legalized or in the future may legalize gaming, such as Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, which could increase competition for our Macau Operations.\nLas Vegas\nLas Vegas is the largest gaming market in the United States. The Las Vegas gaming market is highly competitive and is largely dependent on tourist arrivals and meeting- and convention-related visitation. According to statistics published by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, Las Vegas Strip total gaming win was $8.8 billion in 2024, a 1.0% decrease from $8.9 billion in 2023. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, overall Las Vegas visitor volume was 41.7 million in 2024, a 2.1% increase from 40.8 million in 2023. Occupancy on the Las Vegas Strip was relatively flat at 86.4%, compared to 86.2% in 2023. \nOur Las Vegas Operations are located on the Las Vegas Strip and compete with other high-quality resorts and hotel casinos in Las Vegas. There are several recently completed large-scale integrated resort projects in the vicinity of our Las Vegas Operations, which may present increased competition in the future. Our Las Vegas Operations also compete, to some extent, with other casino resorts throughout the United States and elsewhere in the world.\nMassachusetts\nMassachusetts and its neighboring states of Connecticut and Rhode Island are host to a large, established casino market. The greater Boston metropolitan area is the largest population center in New England, with a population of approximately 5 million residents.\nGaming in the New England region is characterized by a high degree of competition, based largely on location, product quality, service levels, and effectiveness in marketing to and establishing relationships with repeat visitors located in the area. Encore Boston Harbor competes with both commercial and Native American casinos located in the northeastern United States, including two Native American casinos in Connecticut, two casinos in Rhode Island, and MGM Springfield in Massachusetts. Differences in regulatory landscapes across state borders may impact our ability to compete with other casinos in the region. For example, some casino operators in the region may pay lower gaming taxes, or may be permitted to offer gaming amenities we are currently unable to offer at Encore Boston Harbor. We also face competition, to a lesser degree, from operations in the region which offer other forms of legalized gaming and related recreation and leisure facilities, such as state lotteries, horse racing, online gaming, and sports betting.\nRegulation and Licensing\nMacau\nOn December 16, 2022, Wynn Macau SA, an indirect subsidiary of the Company, entered into a definitive gaming concession contract (the \"Gaming Concession Contract\") with the Macau government, pursuant to which Wynn Macau SA was granted a 10-year gaming concession commencing on January 1, 2023 and expiring on December 31, 2032, to operate games of chance at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau. \nAs a casino concessionaire, Wynn Macau SA is subject to the regulatory control of the Macau government. The Macau government has adopted Laws and Administrative Regulations governing the operation of casinos in Macau. Only concessionaires are permitted to operate casinos. Each concessionaire was required to enter into a concession agreement with the Macau government which, together with the Laws and Administrative Regulations, form the framework for the regulation of the activities of the concessionaire.\nUnder the Laws and Administrative Regulations, concessionaires are subject to suitability requirements relating to background, associations and reputation, as are stockholders of 5% or more of a concessionaire's equity securities, officers, directors and key employees. The same requirements apply to any entity engaged by a concessionaire to manage casino operations. Concessionaires are required to satisfy minimum capitalization requirements, demonstrate and maintain adequate financial capacity to operate the concession and submit to continuous monitoring of their casino operations by the Macau government. Concessionaires also are subject to periodic financial reporting requirements and reporting obligations with respect to, among other things, certain contracts, financing activities and transactions with directors, financiers and key employees. \n7 \nTable of Contents\nTransfers or the encumbering of interests in concessionaires must be reported to the Macau government and are ineffective without government approval.\nEach concessionaire is required to engage a managing director who must be a permanent resident of Macau and the holder of at least 15% of the capital stock of the concessionaire. The appointment of the managing director and of any successor is ineffective without the approval of the Macau government. All contracts placing the management of a concessionaire's casino operations with a third party also are ineffective without the approval of the Macau government.\nConcessionaires are subject to a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming revenue, and must also make an annual contribution of up to 5% of gross gaming revenue for the promotion of public interests, social security, infrastructure and tourism. Concessionaires are obligated to withhold applicable taxes, according to the rate in effect as set by the government, from any commissions paid to gaming promoters. The withholding rate may be adjusted from time to time.\nThe Gaming Concession Contract between Wynn Macau SA and the Macau government requires Wynn Macau SA to operate two casinos: \"Casino Wynn Macau\" and \"Casino Wynn Palace.\"\nUnder the Gaming Concession Contract, Wynn Macau SA provided a first demand bank guarantee of MOP1.0 billion (approximately $125.1 million) in favor of the Macau government to support Wynn Macau SA’s legal and contractual obligations, from January 1, 2023 until one hundred and eighty days after the term of the Gaming Concession Contract expires or the rescission of the concession.\nPursuant to the Gaming Concession Contract and the Laws and Administrative Regulations, the Macau government may rescind the gaming concession if Wynn Macau SA fails to fulfill its obligations, including in the circumstances of (i) endangerment to the national security of mainland China or Macau, (ii) failure on the part of Wynn Macau SA to perform its obligations under the Gaming Concession Contract, (iii) public interest, and (iv) Wynn Macau SA ceasing to be eligible for the gaming concession under the Macau gaming law. If the Macau government rescinds the Gaming Concession Contract due to Wynn Macau SA’s non-fulfilment, or perceived non-fulfillment, of its obligations, Wynn Macau SA will be required to transfer to the Macau government, free from any encumbrance or lien and without compensation, all of its casinos, gaming assets and equipment and ownership rights to its casino areas in Macau. Beginning in the eighth year of Wynn Macau SA’s concession, the Macau government may exercise its right to redeem the concession by providing Wynn Macau SA with at least one-year prior written notice. In such event, Wynn Macau SA would be entitled to fair and equitable compensation pursuant to the Macau gaming law. The amount of such compensation relating to the projects agreed with the Macau government would be determined based on the earnings of these projects, before interest, depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year immediately preceding the date the redemption is declared, multiplied by the number of years remaining on the term of the Gaming Concession Contract. The Macau government may assume temporary custody and control over the operation of a concession in certain circumstances. During any such period, the costs of operations must be borne by the concessionaire. \nWynn Macau SA is required to obtain prior approval from the relevant Macau authorities or officials for various corporate changes and actions, including expansion of its business scope, issuance of shares, transfer or creation of any encumbrances over its shares, issuance of debt securities, change of its managing director or the authority delegated thereto, appointment of any new director, change of its articles of association, certain transfers of property rights and creditor’s rights, entering into a consumer loan contract or similar contract with a value equal to or exceeding MOP100.0 million (approximately US$12.5 million), and granting of a loan to any of its directors, shareholders or key employees. Wynn Macau SA is required to notify the Macau government of certain other changes, including any loan, mortgage, claim for obligation, guarantee or the assumption of any debt for financing its business with a value that equals to or exceeds MOP16.0 million (approximately US$2.0 million). In particular, Wynn Macau SA is required to notify the Chief Executive of Macau at least five working days in advance prior to making financial decisions (i) related to the transfer of funds within Wynn Macau SA which exceeds 50% of its share capital, (ii) related to employee salaries, remuneration or benefits which exceed 10% of its share capital, and (iii) not related to above items (i) and (ii), whose value exceeds 10% of its share capital. \nPursuant to the Gaming Concession Contract, Wynn Macau SA is required to submit to the Macau government, for its approval, an annual execution proposal of the specific projects mentioned in the Investment Plan annexed to the Gaming Concession Contract which it intends to execute in the following year by September 30, of each calendar year, detailing each project in which it intends to invest, the investment amount and the execution schedule. Within 60 days after submission of each annual execution proposal, the Macau government will decide on its approval, and may request adjustments to specific projects, the investment amount and/or the execution schedule. If any of the annual execution proposals or parts thereof are not approved by the Macau government, Wynn Macau SA is obliged to propose allocating the relevant funds to other projects, \n8 \nTable of Contents\nwhich are also subject to subsequent approval by the Macau government, while the total investment amount will remain unchanged. The annual execution proposals for the year 2024 and the year 2025 were previously submitted in September 2023 and 2024, respectively, and were thereafter approved by the Macau government. Wynn Macau SA is required to submit a report on the execution of the previous year’s execution proposal by March 31st of each calendar year. The execution report of the proposal for the year 2023 was submitted on March 28, 2024 and was thereafter reviewed by the Macau government. The execution report of the proposal presented by the concessionaires may be subject to extraordinary audit upon determination by the Macau government. In addition, Wynn Macau SA is subject to the supervision of the Macau government in regards to the execution of development projects included in the Investment Plan, and Wynn Macau SA must submit progress reports every two months, and may be requested to submit exceptional detailed reports whenever the normal progress of any development project included in the Investment Plan is compromised.\nNevada\nThe ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations made thereunder (collectively, the \"Nevada Act\"), as well as to various local ordinances. Our Las Vegas Operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission (\"NGC\"), the Nevada Gaming Control Board (\"NGCB\") and the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board (\"CCLGLB\"). The NGC and NGCB are referred to herein collectively as the \"Nevada Gaming Authorities.\"\nThe laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy. Such public policy concerns include, among other things:\n•\npreventing unsavory or unsuitable persons from being directly or indirectly involved with gaming at any time or in any capacity;\n•\nestablishing and maintaining responsible accounting practices and procedures;\n•\nmaintaining effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and safeguarding assets and revenue, providing reliable recordkeeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;\n•\npreventing cheating and fraudulent practices; and\n•\nproviding a source of state and local revenue through taxation and licensing fees.\nAny changes in applicable laws, regulations and procedures could have an adverse effect on our Las Vegas gaming operations and our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, the owner and operator of Wynn Las Vegas, is licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities to conduct casino gaming operations, including a race book and sports pool, pari-mutuel wagering and the operation of gaming salons. It is also licensed as a manufacturer and distributor. These gaming licenses are not transferable.\nWe are required to be registered as a publicly traded corporation (a \"registered public company\")\n \nand to be found suitable by the NGC to own the equity interests of Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC (\"Wynn Resorts Holdings\"). Wynn Resorts Holdings is required to be registered as an intermediary company and to be found suitable to own the equity interests of Wynn Resorts Finance, LLC\n \n(\"Wynn Resorts Finance\") (f/k/a Wynn America, LLC). Wynn Resorts Finance, LLC is required to be registered as an intermediary company and to be found suitable by the NGC to own the equity interests of Wynn America Group, LLC (\"Wynn America Group\"). Wynn America Group is required to be registered as an intermediary company and to be found suitable by the NGC to own the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas Holdings, LLC (\"Wynn Las Vegas Holdings\"). Wynn Las Vegas Holdings is required to be registered as an intermediary company and to be\n \nfound suitable by the NGC to own the equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. Wynn Resorts Holdings, Wynn Resorts Finance, Wynn America Group, and Wynn Las Vegas Holdings are referred to individually as a \"registered intermediary subsidiary\" and collectively as the \"registered intermediary subsidiaries.\" We, the registered intermediary subsidiaries, and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC hold all the various registrations, approvals, permits and licenses required for Wynn Las Vegas, LLC to engage in gaming activities in Nevada.\nNo person may become a member of or receive profits from Wynn Las Vegas, LLC or the registered intermediary subsidiaries without first registering (for equity ownership of 5% or less), or obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material involvement with us, the registered intermediary subsidiaries and/or Wynn Las Vegas, LLC to determine whether the individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming licensee. Officers, directors and certain key \n9 \nTable of Contents\nemployees of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the registered intermediary subsidiaries and our officers and directors who are actively and directly involved in the gaming activities of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may require additional applications and may also deny an application for licensing for any reason which they deem appropriate. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. An applicant for licensing or an applicant for a finding of suitability must pay or must cause to be paid all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensing, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have the jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.\nIf the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director, or key employee unsuitable for licensing or to continue having a relationship with Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, the registered intermediary subsidiaries, or us, we would have to sever all relationships with the person.\n \nIn addition, the Nevada Gaming Authorities may require Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, the registered intermediary subsidiaries, or us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.\n \nDeterminations of suitability are not subject to judicial review. \n \nIf the NGC determines that we, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, or a registered intermediary subsidiary have violated the Nevada Act, it could limit, condition, suspend or revoke our and our intermediary subsidiary registrations and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC's gaming license. In addition, we and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Act at the discretion of the NGC. Further, the NGC could appoint a supervisor to operate Wynn Las Vegas and, under specified circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor's appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the premises) could be forfeited to the State of Nevada. The limitation, conditioning or suspension of any of our gaming licenses and the appointment of a supervisor could, and revocation of any gaming license would, have a significant negative effect on our gaming operations.\nPeriodically, we are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the NGC and provide any other information that the NGC may require. Substantially all of our material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must be reported to, and/or approved by, the NGC.\nAny beneficial owner of our voting or nonvoting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated and have that person's suitability as a beneficial owner of voting securities determined if the NGC has reason to believe that the ownership would be inconsistent with Nevada's declared public policies. If the beneficial owner of the voting or nonvoting securities of Wynn Resorts who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information, including a list of its beneficial owners. The applicant must pay all costs of the investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any investigation.\nThe Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of our voting securities to report the acquisition to the NGC. The Nevada Act requires beneficial owners of more than 10% of a registered company's voting securities to apply to the NGC for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Chair of the NGCB mails the written notice requiring such filing. Under certain circumstances, an \"institutional investor\" as defined in the Nevada Act which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 25%, of a registered company's voting securities may apply to the NGC for a waiver of a finding of suitability if the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may hold more than 25% but not more than 29% of a registered company's voting securities and may, in certain circumstances, own up to 29% of the voting securities of a registered company for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver.\nAn institutional investor will not be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the registered company, a change in the corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered company, or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which the NGC finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered company's voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities which are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include:\n•\nvoting on all matters voted on by stockholders or interest holders;\n•\nmaking financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in management, policies or operations; and\n10 \nTable of Contents\n•\nother activities that the NGC may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.\nWe are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada which may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make the disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are required to provide maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner of any of our voting securities. The NGC has the power to require the stock certificates of any registered company to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Nevada Act. The certificates representing shares of Wynn Resorts' common stock note that the shares are subject to a right of redemption and other restrictions set forth in Wynn Resorts' articles of incorporation and bylaws and that the shares are, or may become, subject to restrictions imposed by applicable gaming laws.\nAny person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the NGC or by the Chair of the NGCB, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in connection with the investigation of its application may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of any voting security or debt security of a registered company beyond the period of time as may be prescribed by the NGC may be guilty of a criminal offense. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to hold an equity interest or to have any other relationship with us, we:\n•\npay that person any dividend or interest upon any voting securities;\n•\nallow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right held by that person relating to Wynn Resorts;\n•\npay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or\n•\nfail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to relinquish such person's voting securities, including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of the voting securities for cash at fair market value.\nThe NGC may, in its discretion, require the owner of any debt or similar securities of a registered public company, to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt or other securities of the registered company if the NGC has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with Nevada's declared public policies. If the NGC decides that a person is unsuitable to own the securities then, under the Nevada Act, the registered public company can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals if, without the prior approval of the NGC, it:\n•\npays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or any distribution whatsoever;\n•\nrecognizes any voting right by the unsuitable person in connection with the securities;\n•\npays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or\n•\nmakes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction.\n We may not make a public offering (debt or equity) without the prior approval of the NGC if the proceeds from the offering are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes or for similar transactions. On March 17, 2022, the NGC granted Wynn Resorts prior approval, subject to certain conditions, to make public offerings for a period of three years (the \"Shelf Approval\"). The Shelf Approval may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chair of the NGCB. As of the date of this report, we are in the process of seeking a renewal of our Shelf Approval for an additional three year period.\nChanges in control of Wynn Resorts through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or any act or conduct by a person whereby the person obtains control may not occur without the prior approval of the NGC.\n \nEntities seeking to acquire control of a registered public company must satisfy the NGCB and the NGC concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control of the registered public company.\nThe NGC may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.\nThe Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada gaming licensees and registered public companies that are affiliated \n11 \nTable of Contents\nwith the operations of Nevada gaming licensees may be harmful to stable and productive corporate gaming. The NGC has established a regulatory scheme to reduce the potential adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada's gaming industry and to further Nevada's policy in order to:\n•\nassure the financial stability of corporate gaming licensees and their affiliated companies;\n•\npreserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and\n•\npromote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.\nApprovals are, in certain circumstances, required from the NGC before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above its current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a registered company's Board of Directors in response to a tender offer made directly to its stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control.\nThe Nevada Act requires any person who individually or in association with others, acquires or holds any amount of any class of voting securities, or each plan sponsor of a pension or employee benefit plan that acquires or holds any amount of any class of voting securities in a registered public company with the intent to engage in an activity that necessitates an amendment to a corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operation of a registered public company, to engage in an activity that materially influences or affects the affairs of a registered public company, or to engage any other activity that the NGC determines is inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes to, within 2 days after possession of that intent, notify the NGCB Chair and apply to the NGC for a finding of suitability within 30 days after notification to the NGCB Chair. \nLicense fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the counties and cities in which the licensed subsidiaries' respective operations are conducted. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon a percentage of the gross revenue received; the number of gaming devices operated; or the number of table games operated. A live entertainment tax also is imposed on admission charges where live entertainment is furnished.\nBecause we are involved in gaming ventures outside of Nevada, we are required to deposit with the NGCB, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation of the NGCB of our participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the NGC. Thereafter, we are also required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Act. A licensee or registrant is also subject to disciplinary action by the NGC if it:\n•\nknowingly violates any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation;\n•\nfails to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;\n•\nengages in any activity or enters into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or tends to reflect, discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada;\n•\nengages in activities or enters into associations that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees; or\n•\nemploys, contracts with or associates with a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of unsuitability.\n The conduct of gaming activities and the service and sale of alcoholic beverages at Wynn Las Vegas are subject to licensing, control and regulation by the CCLGLB, which has granted Wynn Las Vegas, LLC licenses for such purposes. In addition to approving Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, the CCLGLB has the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the equity of any entity controlling a gaming license. Certain of our officers, directors and key employees have been or may be required to file applications with the CCLGLB. Clark County gaming and liquor licenses are not transferable. The County has full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license. Any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a substantial negative impact on our operations.\nMassachusetts\nThe Massachusetts Expanded Gaming Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively the \"Massachusetts Act\") subjects the owners and operators of gaming establishments to extensive state licensing and regulatory requirements. We \n12 \nTable of Contents\nare subject to the Massachusetts Act through our ownership interest in Wynn MA, LLC, (\"Wynn MA\") which operates Encore Boston Harbor.\nThe Massachusetts Gaming Commission (\"MGC\") is responsible for issuing licenses under the Massachusetts Act and assuring that licenses are not issued or held by unqualified, disqualified or unsuitable persons. The Investigations and Enforcement Bureau (\"IEB\") division of the MGC, has extensive authority to conduct background investigations of applicants and licensees, and for generally enforcing the Massachusetts Act. The MGC has the authority to award up to three Category 1 licenses (table games and slot machines), and one Category 2 license (slot machines only), within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to qualified applicants.\nOn September 17, 2014, the MGC designated Wynn MA the award winner of the Category 1 Greater Boston gaming license effective November 7, 2014. We, our relevant subsidiaries, and individual qualifiers required to be qualified have been found suitable by the MGC. Additional entities and key employees have been and will be required to file applications with the MGC and are or may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the MGC. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the MGC.\nIf the MGC were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the MGC may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.\nThe initial license term is for 15 years, which commenced upon the MGC’s confirmation of its approval of the commencement of the operation of the gaming establishment on June 23, 2019. Wynn MA's gaming license is conditioned upon Wynn MA continuing to meet applicable licensing, registration, qualification and other regulatory requirements. The initial license fee for Category 1 licenses is $85.0 million, which Wynn MA has paid. All Category 1 and Category 2 gaming licenses are also subject to additional annual fees under the Massachusetts Act. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts also receives 25% of gross gaming revenues for Category 1 licensees. \nEncore Boston Harbor was granted a sports wagering license by the MGC on December 8, 2022 under 2022 legislation legalizing sports wagering in Massachusetts.  Under the 2022 legislation, Encore Boston Harbor is authorized to operate a sportsbook and is entitled to two individually branded mobile platforms. The initial term of the sports wagering licenses, which carries a $5.0 million initial license fee, is 5 years.  Sports wagering licenses are also subject to additional regulatory fees.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts receives 15% of gross retail sports wagering revenues. \nThe MGC has responsibility for the continuing regulation and licensing of the licensee and its officers, directors, employees and other designated persons. The MGC retains the authority to suspend, revoke or condition a Category 1 license, or any other license issued under the Massachusetts Act, and the IEB may levy civil penalties for regulatory and other violations. All licenses issued under the Massachusetts Act are expressly deemed a revocable privilege, conditioned on the licensee's fulfillment of all conditions of licensure, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the licensee's continuing qualification and suitability. Among other things, the MGC is also responsible for the collection of application, license and other fees, conducting investigations of and monitoring applicants and licensees, and reviewing and ruling on complaints, and may conduct inspections of the gaming establishment premises or the licensee's records and equipment.\nPursuant to the Massachusetts Act, the MGC may grant a gaming beverage license for the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages for a gaming establishment. The division of gaming liquor enforcement of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission has the authority to enforce, regulate and control the distribution of alcoholic beverages in a gaming establishment. The MGC may revoke, suspend, refuse to renew or refuse to transfer a gaming beverage license for violations of the Massachusetts Act that pertain to the sale and distribution of alcohol consumed on the premises and the regulations adopted by the MGC. The MGC has adopted regulations for the issuance of gaming beverage licenses. These regulations and any changes in applicable laws, regulations and procedures could have significant negative effects on our future Massachusetts gaming operations and results of operations.\nUnder the Massachusetts Gaming Act, the MGC is charged with \"establishing the financial stability and integrity of gaming licensees, as well as the integrity of their sources of financing\" this includes the licensure or qualification of certain persons with a financial interest in a gaming licensee or in a gaming establishment. The Gaming Act requires licensure of anyone with a financial interest in a gaming establishment, or with a financial interest in the business of the gaming licensee or \n13 \nTable of Contents\nwho is a close associate of a gaming licensee. While the Gaming Act and MGC’s regulations contain exemptions for certain financial institutions and transactions, and generally focus on actual or beneficial ownership interests, the MGC retains significant discretion to require licensure of anyone with a financial interest in a gaming licensee or gaming establishment including any company holding over 15% of the licensee, or a holding, intermediary or subsidiary company of a licensee or of an individual that can exercise control or provide direction to a gaming licensee. Like its discretionary authority to require licensure, the MGC also has discretionary authority to grant a waiver from licensure to any person that cannot exercise control or provide direction to a gaming licensee or a holding, intermediary or subsidiary company thereof.\nCertain transfer of interests in a Massachusetts gaming licensee or gaming establishment may require notice to the MGC and approval of any new person required to be licensed as a result of the transfer. A transfer of interest that also results in a change in control may require further review and approval by the MGC. No notice or approval is required for the open market transfer of less than five per cent interest in the holding company, parent or intermediary company of the licensee.  The granting of a security interest in a gaming license or gaming establishment to certain banking or commercial financial institutions in return for financing does not require prior notice or approval by the MGC.\nOther Regulations\nIn addition to gaming regulations, we are subject to extensive local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These include, but are not limited to, laws and regulations relating to alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employment and immigration, currency and other transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, marketing and advertising, lending, debt collection, privacy, telemarketing, money laundering, laws and regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"). Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 28,000 employees (including approximately 11,500 in Macau and 16,500 in the United States). We foster the growth and development of our employees to ensure that they remain best-equipped to deliver the singular customer service at each of our resorts. Across our resorts, we maintain an extensive program of training and development focused on skills development and career advancement. \nOur non-union employees are all eligible to participate in the Company paid health, vision, dental, life, prescription, and long-term disability insurance plans. The Company also provides employee paid supplemental life and accident insurance plans. In the U.S., to encourage employees to keep up with routine medical care and participate in its wellness program, the Company funds a health reimbursement account for participating employees. To help employees cover medical expenses pre-tax, the Company offers employees in the U.S. a flexible spending account. The Company also offers defined contribution retirement plans to its eligible employees, and a non-mandatory central provident fund scheme to eligible employees in Macau which includes contributions from employees and the employer. \nOur collective bargaining agreement with the Culinary Workers Union, Local 226, and Bartenders Union, Local 165, which covers approximately 6,340 culinary, housekeeping, public area, and front services employees at Wynn Las Vegas resort casino, is effective from August 1, 2023 through November 30, 2028.

As a result, and in connection with expansion of our resorts and gaming activities outside the United States, we have undertaken a program to register our trademarks and other intellectual property rights in relevant jurisdictions. We have retained counsel and intend to take all steps necessary to protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use throughout the world.\nPursuant to the Surname Rights Agreement, dated August 6, 2004, Stephen A. Wynn (\"Mr. Wynn\") granted us our exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual, worldwide license to use, and to own and register trademarks and service marks incorporating the \"Wynn\" surname for casino resorts and related businesses, together with the right to sublicense the name and marks to affiliates.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nDiscussion of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.  \nOverview\nWe are a designer, developer, and operator of integrated resorts featuring luxury hotel rooms, high-end retail space, an array of dining and entertainment options, meeting and convention facilities, and gaming, all supported by an unparalleled focus on our guests, our people, and our community. Through our approximately 72% ownership of Wynn Macau, Limited (\"WML\"), our concessionaire Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A. (\"Wynn Macau SA\") operates two integrated resorts in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (\"Macau\"), Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau (collectively, our \"Macau Operations\"). In Las Vegas, Nevada, we operate and, with the exception of certain retail space, own 100% of Wynn Las Vegas. We are a 50.1% owner and managing member of a joint venture that owns and leases certain retail space at Wynn Las Vegas (the \"Retail Joint Venture\"). We refer to Wynn Las Vegas, Encore, an expansion at Wynn Las Vegas, and the Retail Joint Venture as our Las Vegas Operations. In Everett, Massachusetts, we operate Encore Boston Harbor, an integrated resort. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024,\n Wynn Interactive Ltd. no longer met the requirements for a reportable segment due to the Company's decision to cease operating Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino business. As a result, its assets and results of operations are presented in Corporate and other and previous period amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the current period presentation of the Company's reportable segments.\nThe Company has a 40% equity interest in Island 3 AMI FZ-LLC (\"Island 3\"), an unconsolidated affiliate, which is constructing Wynn Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates.\nKey Operating Measures\nCertain key operating measures specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which the Consolidated Statements of Operations are presented. These key operating measures are presented as supplemental disclosures because management and/or certain investors use these measures to better understand period-over-period fluctuations in our casino and hotel operating revenues. These key operating measures are defined below:\n•\nTable drop in mass market for our Macau Operations is the amount of cash that is deposited in a gaming table's drop box plus cash chips purchased at the casino cage. \n•\nTable drop for our Las Vegas Operations is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.\n•\nTable drop for Encore Boston Harbor is the amount of cash and gross markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.\n•\nRolling chips are non-negotiable identifiable chips that are used to track turnover for purposes of calculating incentives within our Macau Operations' VIP program.\n•\nTurnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our Macau Operations' VIP program. \n•\nTable games win is the amount of table drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenues.  Table games win is before discounts, commissions and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis. Table games win does not include poker rake.\n•\nSlot machine win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenues. Slot machine win is after adjustment for progressive accruals and free play, but before discounts and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis.\n•\nPoker rake is the portion of cash wagered by patrons in our poker rooms that is retained by the casino as a service fee, after adjustment for progressive accruals, but before the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis. Poker tables are not included in our measure of average number of table games.\n36 \nTable of Contents\n•\nAverage daily rate (\"ADR\") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms occupied. \n•\nRevenue per available room (\"REVPAR\") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms available. \n•\nOccupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by the total rooms available. \nBelow is a discussion of the methodologies used to calculate win percentages at our resorts.\nIn our mass market operations in Macau, customers may purchase cash chips at either the gaming tables or at the casino cage. The measurements from our VIP and mass market operations are not comparable as the measurement method used in our mass market operations tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table and at the casino cage, while the measurement method from our VIP operations tracks the sum of all losing wagers. Accordingly, the base measurement from the VIP operations is much larger than the base measurement from the mass market operations. As a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is lower in the VIP operations when compared to the mass market operations.\nIn our VIP operations in Macau, customers primarily purchase rolling chips from the casino cage and can only use them to make wagers. Winning wagers are paid in cash chips. The loss of the rolling chips in the VIP operations is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating VIP win percentage. It is customary in Macau to measure VIP play using this rolling chip method. We typically expect our win as a percentage of turnover from these operations to be within the range of 3.1% to 3.4%. \nIn Las Vegas, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables in exchange for cash and markers. Customers may then redeem markers at the gaming tables or at the casino cage. The cash and markers, net of redemptions, used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. This is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage. Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. Our expected table games win percentage is 22% to 26%.\nAt Encore Boston Harbor, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables in exchange for cash and markers. Customers may then redeem markers only at the casino cage. The cash and gross markers used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. This is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage. Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. Our expected table games win percentage is 18% to 22%.\nResults of Operations\nSummary annual results\nThe following table summarizes our financial results for the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/ (Decrease)\nPercent Change\nOperating revenues\n$\n7,127,961 \n$\n6,531,897 \n$\n596,064 \n9.1 \nNet income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited\n501,078 \n729,994 \n(228,916)\n(31.4)\nDiluted net income per share\n4.35 \n6.32 \n(1.97)\n(31.2)\nThe increase in operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by increases of $330.8 million, $251.1 million, and $91.3 million from Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau, and our Las Vegas Operations, respectively, primarily due to an increase in gaming volumes and restaurant covers at our Macau Operations and an increase in ADR, entertainment venue sales and revenue from leased retail outlets at our Las Vegas Operations.\nThe decrease in net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily related to a decrease in the benefit from income taxes of $500.5 million, partially offset by increased revenues at our Macau Operations. \n37 \nTable of Contents\nFinancial results for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023\nOperating revenues\nThe following table presents our operating revenues (dollars in thousands):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nIncrease/ (Decrease)\nPercent Change\nOperating revenues\nMacau Operations:\nWynn Palace\n$\n2,217,671 \n$\n1,886,844 \n$\n330,827 \n17.5 \nWynn Macau\n1,464,646 \n1,213,534 \n251,112 \n20.7 \nTotal Macau Operations\n3,682,317\n \n3,100,378\n \n581,939\n \n18.8 \nLas Vegas Operations\n2,571,913 \n2,480,606 \n91,307 \n3.7 \nEncore Boston Harbor \n857,164 \n865,786 \n(8,622)\n(1.0)\nCorporate and other\n16,567 \n85,127 \n(68,560)\n(80.5)\n$\n7,127,961\n \n$\n6,531,897\n \n$\n596,064\n \n9.1 \nThe following table presents our casino and non-casino operating revenues (dollars in thousands):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nIncrease/ (Decrease)\nPercent Change\nOperating revenues\nCasino revenues\n$\n4,261,357\n \n$\n3,718,402\n \n$\n542,955\n \n14.6 \nNon-casino revenues:\nRooms\n1,242,058 \n1,185,671 \n56,387 \n4.8 \nFood and beverage\n1,069,117 \n1,028,637 \n40,480 \n3.9 \nEntertainment, retail and other\n555,429 \n599,187 \n(43,758)\n(7.3)\nTotal non-casino revenues\n2,866,604\n \n2,813,495\n \n53,109\n \n1.9 \n$\n7,127,961\n \n$\n6,531,897\n \n$\n596,064\n \n9.1 \nCasino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 were 59.8% of operating revenues, compared to 56.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Not meaningful.\nThe increase in total operating expenses was primarily due to increased operating costs associated with higher business volumes at our properties, partially offset by decreased operating expenses related to Wynn Interactive following the closure of Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino gaming business.   \nCasino expenses increased $194.4 million and $133.4 million at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, respectively. These increases resulted from higher operating costs, including increases of $166.5 million and $114.7 million in incremental gaming tax expense at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, respectively, driven by the increase in casino revenues. \nRoom expenses increased $18.2 million at our Las Vegas Operations as a result of higher payroll and other operating costs. \nFood and beverage expenses increased $19.2 million and $16.2 million at our Las Vegas Operations and our Macau Operations, respectively, as a result of higher payroll and other operating costs.   \nEntertainment, retail and other expenses decreased $112.6 million at Corporate and other as a result of decreased operating costs related to Wynn Interactive. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $26.7 million at our Las Vegas Operations primarily due to increased costs from entertainment venue related revenue.  \nDepreciation and amortization decreased $33.7 million at Encore Boston Harbor as result of certain furniture, fixtures and equipment assets being fully depreciated five years after the opening of the property in June of 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized impairment of goodwill and other finite-lived intangible assets of $72.1 million and $22.4 million, respectively, as a result of our decision to close Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino gaming business. \nProperty charges and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted primarily of $130.0 million of forfeitures pursuant to a non-prosecution agreement and the Company's $9.4 million contribution towards a legal settlement, both of which are described in Item 8—\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 18, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\" Property charges and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 also included $20.7 million of asset abandonments at our Macau Operations, $61.5 million of expensed project costs related to a discontinued development project at Corporate and other, $16.9 million of contract termination and other costs related to Wynn Interactive and a gain of $24.6 million related to the sale of certain Wynn Interactive assets. \n42 \nTable of Contents\nProperty charges and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of contract termination and other expenses of $94.6 million, as a result of our decision to close Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino gaming business. Property charges and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 also included other contract terminations of $8.7 million at Wynn Macau and asset abandonments of $12.7 million and $8.0 million at Wynn Palace and our Las Vegas Operations, respectively.\nOther non-operating income and expenses\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased $63.1 million primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average debt balance, from $12.38 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, to $11.45 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, we capitalized interest of $23.0 million and $5.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe recorded interest income of $130.3 million and $175.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents held at financial institutions. \nWe incurred a foreign currency remeasurement gain of $29.2 million and a loss of $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impact of the exchange rate fluctuation of the Macau pataca, in relation to the U.S. dollar, on the remeasurements of U.S. dollar denominated debt and other obligations from our Macau-related entities drove the variability between periods. \nWe recorded a gain of $42.5 million and $45.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to the change in derivative fair value of the conversion feature of the WML Convertible Bonds.\nWe recorded a $2.9 million loss on debt financing transactions for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily related to the issuance of the 2031 Add-On WRF Senior Notes, 2033 WRF Senior Notes, and the repurchase of the 2025 WLV Senior Notes. We recorded a $12.7 million loss on debt financing transactions for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to the issuance of the 2031 WRF Senior Notes and the repurchase of the tendered 2025 WRF Senior Notes.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an income tax expense of $3.7 million and a benefit of $496.8 million, respectively. The 2024 income tax expense primarily relates to U.S. profitability as well as an increase in non-deductible expenses offset by the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. The 2023 income tax benefit primarily relates to the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets.\nIn 2024, Wynn Macau SA received an exemption from Macau’s 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2027. Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau special gaming tax and other levies in accordance with our concession agreement.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $138.6 million and $52.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are primarily related to the noncontrolling interests' share of net income from WML.\nSegment Information\nAs further described in Item 8—\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 20, \"Segment Information,\" we use Adjusted Property EBITDAR to manage the operating results of our segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening expenses, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, property charges and other expenses, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other expenses (including intercompany golf course, meeting and convention, and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, change in derivatives fair value, loss on debt financing transactions, and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for \n43 \nTable of Contents\nvaluation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDAR as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. We also present Adjusted Property EBITDAR because it is used by some investors to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDAR as a supplement to GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDAR calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted Property EBITDAR does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDAR. Also, our calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\n44 \nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes Adjusted Property EBITDAR (in thousands) for Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau, Las Vegas Operations, Encore Boston Harbor, and Corporate and other as reviewed by management and summarized in Item 8—\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 20, \"Segment Information.\" That footnote also presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR to net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nIncrease/ (Decrease)\nWynn Palace\n$\n733,710 \n$\n615,846 \n$\n117,864 \nWynn Macau\n441,852 \n338,091 \n103,761 \nLas Vegas Operations\n946,762 \n946,243 \n519 \nEncore Boston Harbor\n247,128 \n257,409 \n(10,281)\nCorporate and other\n(4,535)\n(42,646)\n38,111 \nAdjusted Property EBITDAR at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau increased $117.9 million and $103.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in operating revenues of $330.8 million and $251.1 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.\nAdjusted Property EBITDAR at our Las Vegas Operations remained relatively consistent in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nAdjusted Property EBITDAR at Encore Boston Harbor decreased $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in operating revenues of $8.6 million.\nAdjusted Property EBITDAR at Corporate and other increased $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in marketing and promotional expenses related to Wynn Interactive following our decision, announced in August 2023, to close Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino gaming business. \nRefer to the discussions above regarding the specific details of our results of operations. \n45 \nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nOur cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nCash Flows - Summary \n2024\n2023\nCash flows from operating activities\n$\n1,426,203\n \n$\n1,247,879\n \nCash flows from investing activities: \nCapital expenditures, net of construction payables and retention\n(419,929)\n(442,793)\nInvestment in unconsolidated affiliates\n(563,418)\n(53,631)\nPurchase of investments\n— \n(836,519)\nProceeds from maturity of investments\n850,000 \n— \nPurchase of intangible and other assets\n(2,615)\n(10,752)\nProceeds from sale of assets and other\n52,404 \n1,162 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(83,558)\n(1,342,533)\nCash flows from financing activities: \nProceeds from issuance of long-term debt\n1,883,794 \n1,200,000 \nRepayments of long-term debt\n(3,059,832)\n(1,533,124)\nRepurchase of common stock\n(401,802)\n(212,455)\nProceeds from exercise of stock options\n1,017 \n1,965 \nDistribution to noncontrolling interest\n(16,988)\n(22,579)\nDividends paid\n(139,564)\n(84,733)\nFinance lease payments\n(19,219)\n(19,267)\nPayments for financing costs\n(36,714)\n(41,240)\nOther\n(4,486)\n(7,773)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(1,793,794)\n(719,206)\nEffect of exchange rate on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash \n3,530\n \n282\n \nDecrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash \n$\n(447,619)\n$\n(813,578)\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flows primarily consist of operating income (excluding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges), interest paid and earned, and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, and payables. Our table games play is a mix of cash play and credit play, while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis. A significant portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of premium customers who gamble on credit. The ability to collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period. Our rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail and other revenue is conducted on a cash and credit basis. Accordingly, operating cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivable, net.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to increased revenues from our Macau Operations and our Las Vegas Operations, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses associated with higher business volumes. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to increased revenues from our Macau Operations and our Las Vegas Operations, which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses associated with higher business volumes. \n46 \nTable of Contents\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities primarily consist of project capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures associated with maintaining and continually refining our world-class integrated resort properties.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred capital expenditures of $159.8 million at our Las Vegas Operations, $107.5 million at Wynn Palace, $57.7 million at Wynn Macau, and $32.7 million at Encore Boston Harbor, primarily related to enhancements at our properties and maintenance capital expenditures, and $62.4 million at Corporate and other, primarily related to future development projects. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2024, we invested $557.3 million, including $541.7 million of cash contributions, in the joint venture that is constructing Wynn Al Marjan Island, and received proceeds of $850.0 million upon the maturity of investments.  \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred capital expenditures of $187.2 million at our Las Vegas Operations, $70.6 million at Encore Boston Harbor, $66.3 million at Wynn Palace, and $25.6 million at Wynn Macau, primarily related to enhancements at our properties and maintenance capital expenditures, and $93.2 million at Corporate and other primarily related to future development projects.

WML generates cash from our Macau Operations and may utilize proceeds from the WM Cayman II Revolver as needed. We expect to use this cash to service our WML Senior Notes, WM Cayman II Revolver, and WML Convertible Bonds, to pay dividends to shareholders of WML (of which we own approximately 72%), and to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements at WML and our Macau Operations. \nWe expect to make estimated project capital expenditures of between $250 million and $300 million during 2025 and between $450 million and $500 million during 2026 related to enhancements at our Macau Operations. We expect to make maintenance capital expenditures at our Macau Operations of between $70 million and $80 million during 2025.\nWML is a holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends to WRF is dependent on WML receiving distributions from its subsidiaries. WML, as guarantor under the WM Cayman II Revolver facility agreement, may be subject to certain restrictions on payments of dividends or distributions to its shareholders, unless certain financial criteria have been satisfied. The WM Cayman II Revolver facility agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and events of default customary for similar financings, including, but not limited to, restrictions on indebtedness to be incurred by WM Cayman II or its subsidiaries.\nIn May 2024, the WML Board of Directors announced an amendment to WML's dividend policy, pursuant to which the WML Board of Directors will meet semiannually to consider the declaration of dividends, and may also meet at any time during the year as the WML Board of Directors deems fit to consider the declaration of special dividends. \nOn June 19, 2024, WML paid a cash dividend of HK$0.075 per share for a total U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $50.4 million in respect of the year ended December 31, 2023. Our share of this dividend was $36.0 million. On September 12, 2024, WML paid a cash dividend of HK$0.075 per share for a total U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $50.5 million in respect of the six months ended June 30, 2024. Our share of this dividend was $36.1 million.\n48 \nTable of Contents\nIn September 2024, WM Cayman II and WML entered into an amendment agreement to its existing facility agreement to extend the maturity date of the outstanding loans under the existing facility agreement from September 2025 to September 2028. \nIn October 2024, we repaid the $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of WML's 4 7/8% Senior Notes due 2024 on their stated maturity date.\nIf our portion of cash available for repatriation was repatriated on December 31, 2024, it would be subject to minimal U.S. taxes. \nWynn Resorts Finance, LLC and subsidiaries.\n Wynn Resorts Finance, LLC (\"WRF\" or \"Wynn Resorts Finance\") generates cash from distributions from its subsidiaries, which include our Macau Operations, Wynn Las Vegas, and Encore Boston Harbor, and capital contributions from Wynn Resorts, as required. In addition, WRF may utilize its available revolving borrowing capacity as needed. We expect to use this cash to service our WRF Credit Facilities, the WRF Senior Notes, and the Wynn Las Vegas Senior Notes, and to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements as needed.\nWe expect to make estimated project capital expenditures of between $375 million and $400 million during 2025 and between $200 million and $225 million during 2026 related to enhancements at our Las Vegas Operations. We expect to make total maintenance capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Operations and Encore Boston Harbor of between $90 million and $115 million, on a combined basis, during 2025.\nWRF is a holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends to Wynn Resorts is dependent on WRF receiving distributions from its subsidiaries. The WRF Credit Agreement contains customary negative and financial covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict WRF's ability to pay dividends or distributions and incur additional indebtedness.\nIn February 2024, WRF issued an additional $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2031 (the \"2031 WRF Add-On Senior Notes\") in a private offering. The 2031 WRF Add-On Senior Notes were issued at a price equal to 103.0% of the principal amount, for net proceeds of approximately $409.5 million. \nIn February and March 2024, we repurchased $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5 1/2% Senior Notes due 2025 (the \"2025 WLV Senior Notes\"), which consisted of i) $681.0 million aggregate principal amount of validly tendered notes repurchased at a price equal to 97.2% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest and an early tender premium of $20.3 million, and ii) $119.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased on a pro-rata basis at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest under the terms of its indenture. Included in the $119.0 million repurchase was $3.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 WLV Senior Notes held by Wynn Resorts. We used the net proceeds from the 2031 WRF Add-On Senior Notes and cash held by WRF to purchase such validly tendered 2025 WLV Senior Notes and to pay the early tender premium and related fees and expenses. \nIn September 2024, WRF and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment (the \"WRF Credit Agreement Amendment\") to its existing credit agreement (the \"WRF Credit Agreement\"). The WRF Credit Agreement Amendment amends the WRF Credit Agreement to (i) extend the stated maturity date for lenders electing to extend their revolving commitments in an amount equal to approximately $68.7 million from September 20, 2024 to September 20, 2027, and (ii) extend the stated maturity date for lenders electing to extend their term loan commitments in an amount equal to approximately $71.8 million from September 20, 2024 to September 20, 2027.  \nAlso in September 2024, WRF issued $800 million aggregate principal amount of 6 1/4% Senior Notes due 2033 (the \"2033 WRF Senior Notes\") in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, as amended. The 2033 WRF Senior Notes were issued at par, for net proceeds of $795.0 million. A portion of the proceeds from the offering of the 2033 WRF Senior Notes was used in October 2024 to repurchase the remaining outstanding $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of WLV 5.500% Senior Notes due 2025 at a price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest. \nIncluded in the $600.0 million repurchase was $16.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 WLV Senior Notes held by Wynn Resorts. \n49 \nTable of Contents\nWynn Resorts, Limited and other subsidiaries.\n Wynn Resorts, Limited is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries' ability to provide funds to us. Wynn Resorts, Limited and other primarily generates cash from royalty (including intellectual property license) and management agreements with our resorts, dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries, and the operations of the Retail Joint Venture of which we own 50.1%. Fees payable by Wynn Macau SA to Wynn Resorts, Limited under its intellectual property license agreement are capped at $150.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2025. We expect to use cash held by Wynn Resorts, Limited and other to service our Retail Term Loan, to fund working capital needs of our subsidiaries, pay dividends, make required capital contributions to the entity which owns Wynn Al Marjan Island, and for general corporate purposes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company determined not to proceed with its planned phased development project adjacent to Encore Boston Harbor, and expensed $61.5 million of costs, including $4.7 million of internally allocated overhead, that had been previously capitalized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company contributed $541.7 million of cash into Island 3, bringing our life-to-date cash contributions to $631.7 million. The cash contributed during the year was used primarily to fund our pro rata portion of the purchase of approximately 155 acres of land underlying the Wynn Al Marjan Island development site, including the remaining 70 acres of land on Island 3 for potential future development (the \"Marjan Land Bank\"). We estimate our remaining 40% pro-rata share of the required equity for the construction of Wynn Al Marjan Island is between $700 million and $775 million inclusive of capitalized interest, fees, and certain improvements on the Island. Wynn Al Marjan Island is currently expected to open in 2027.\nThe Company paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per share in each of the quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2024 and recorded an aggregate amount of $111.1 million against accumulated deficit in the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOn February 13, 2025, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share on its common stock, payable on March 5, 2025 to stockholders of record as of February 24, 2025.\nIn October 2024, we amended the retail term loan agreement to, among other things, extend the scheduled maturity date to July 2027 and provide for an interest rate adjustment. We also made a principal repayment of the term loan in the amount of $15.0 million.\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity\nWe may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.\nLegal proceedings in which we are involved also may impact our liquidity. No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such proceedings. In addition, litigation inherently involves significant costs. For information regarding legal proceedings, see Item 8—\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 18, \"Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nIn November 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase a total of up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, increasing the previously available repurchase authorization by approximately $766 million. The equity repurchase program authorizes discretionary repurchases by the Company from time to time through open market purchases, including pursuant to plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchases, or block trades, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date, and the equity repurchase program may be suspended, discontinued or accelerated at any time. As of December 31, 2024, we had $813.0 million in repurchase authority remaining under the program.\nWe have in the past repurchased, and in the future, we may periodically consider repurchasing our outstanding notes for cash. The amount of any shares and/or notes to be repurchased, as well as the timing of any repurchases, will be based on business, market and other conditions and factors, including price, contractual requirements or consents, and capital availability.\nNew business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any new development may \n50 \nTable of Contents\nrequire us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts, Limited or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas, Boston or Macau-related entities.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn February 2025, Wynn Al Marjan Island FZ-LLC (the \"Borrower\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Island 3, an unconsolidated affiliate, entered into a facility agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the \"Al Marjan Facility Agreement\") which provides the Borrower with a $2.4 billion (or equivalent in local currency) delayed draw secured term loan facility to finance the development of Wynn Al Marjan Island (the \"Al Marjan Facility\"). The Company is not a party to the Al Marjan Facility Agreement, but as a condition precedent to the Al Marjan Facility being made available to the Borrower, the Company and the government of Ras Al Khaimah entered into a completion guarantee agreement in favor of certain secured parties under the Al Marjan Facility Agreement.

As further discussed in Item 8—\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 14, \"Income Taxes,\" we had $131.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign the related potential tax obligations to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2024.\nGaming Concession Contract\nIn December 2022, Wynn Macau SA entered into a definitive gaming concession contract (the \"Gaming Concession Contract\") with the government of Macau, pursuant to which Wynn Macau SA was granted a 10-year gaming concession commencing on January 1, 2023 and expiring on December 31, 2032, to operate games of chance at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau.\nIn addition to the Macau gaming premium and Property Transfer Agreements payment commitments included in the table above, Wynn Macau SA committed to make certain non-gaming and gaming investments in the amount of MOP21.03 billion (approximately $2.63 billion) over the course of the ten-year term of the Gaming Concession Contract. MOP19.80 billion (approximately $2.48 billion) of the committed investment will be used for non-gaming capital projects and event programming in connection with, among others, attraction of foreign tourists, conventions and exhibitions, entertainment performances, sports events, culture and art, health and wellness, themed amusement, gastronomy, community tourism and maritime tourism. \nAdditionally, Wynn Macau SA committed to make the following payments throughout the term of the Gaming Concession Contract:\n(i) Special gaming premium - Wynn Macau SA is obligated to pay a special annual gaming premium if the average of the gross gaming revenues of the Company's gaming tables and gaming machines is lower than a certain minimum amount determined by the Macau government. A minimum average annual gross gaming revenue of MOP7.0 million (approximately \n52 \nTable of Contents\n$0.9 million) per gaming table and MOP300,000 (approximately $38 thousand) per gaming machine has been set by Macau government. If Wynn Macau SA fails to reach such minimum gross gaming revenue, Wynn Macau SA will be required to pay a special premium equal to the difference between the special gaming tax calculated based on the actual gross gaming revenue and that of such minimum gross gaming revenue. No special gaming premium was paid for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023;\n(ii) Special levies, totaling 5% of gross gaming revenues. The Macau government may reduce the special levies payable by Wynn Macau SA (1) based on Wynn Macau SA’s contribution to the attraction of tourists who enter Macau for tourism and business purposes and hold travel documents issued by countries or regions other than the People’s Republic of China; (2) if Wynn Macau SA’s operations are adversely affected by abnormal, unpredictable or force majeure circumstances associated with the prevailing economic conditions of Macau; or (3) factors as determined by the Chief Executive of Macau; and\n(iii) Special gaming tax assessed at the rate of 35% of gross gaming revenues.\nSee Item 8—\"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" Note 18, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" for additional information regarding the amounts owed under the Gaming Concession Contract and Macau Gaming Law.\nWynn Al Marjan Island Funding Commitment\nWe estimate our remaining 40% pro-rata share of the required equity for the construction of Wynn Al Marjan Island integrated resort is between $700 million and $775 million inclusive of capitalized interest, fees, and certain improvements on the Island. Wynn Al Marjan Island is currently expected to open in 2027.\n53 \nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates and on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities generally is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had deferred tax assets of $1.50 billion, including a foreign tax credit (\"FTC\") carryforward of $533.5 million and deferred tax assets related to interest expense carryforwards of $157.6 million and net operating loss carryforwards of $201.7 million. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. In this assessment, appropriate consideration was given to all positive and negative evidence including recent operating profitability, forecasts of future earnings, ability to carryback, the reversal of net taxable temporary differences, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies. The need for valuation allowances against deferred tax assets will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and, as a result, the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances.\nIn 2024, we recorded a $735.9 million net decrease to valuation allowances, including a $693.3 million decrease to valuation allowance on FTC carryforwards. Of the $693.3 million net decrease, $614.9 million relates to expirations of FTCs in 2024 and the remaining $78.4 million represents FTCs more likely than not to be realized based on changes in future taxable income and tax planning strategies.\nIn 2023, we considered both the achievement of sustained profitability and cumulative income as well as forecasted income and tax planning strategies to be significant forms of positive evidence. We determined that the positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence and supported a release of a portion of the valuation allowance. Therefore, we recorded a $1.10 billion net decrease to valuation allowances, including a $971.7 million decrease to the valuation allowance on FTC carryforwards. Of the $971.7 million decrease, $97.5 million related to utilization and $572.6 million related to expirations of FTCs in 2023. The remaining $301.6 million represented FTCs more likely than not to be realized based on future taxable income and tax planning strategies. We also recorded a $158.0 million decrease in valuation allowance on disallowed interest expense carryforward. \nOur income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. We assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes. The accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.\nUncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. These accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.\nAs applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.\n54 \nTable of Contents\nRecommendations made by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 2.0 (\"BEPS 2.0\") project have the potential to lead to changes in the tax laws in numerous countries, including the implementation of a global minimum tax. Several countries around the world have enacted or proposed changes to their existing tax laws based on these recommendations. We are monitoring the potential changes in tax laws resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting, which could impact our effective tax rate.\nWML Convertible Bond Conversion Option Derivative\nIn March 2023, WML completed the offering of the WML Convertible Bonds. The Company determined that the conversion feature contained within the WML Convertible Bonds is not indexed to WML's equity and, as such, is required to be bifurcated from the debt host contract and accounted for as a free-standing derivative (the \"WML Convertible Bonds Conversion Option Derivative\"). In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the WML Convertible Bond Conversion Option Derivative is reported at fair value as of the end of each reporting period, with changes recognized in the statements of operations.\nThe Company used a binomial lattice model in order to estimate the fair value of the embedded derivative in the WML Convertible Bonds. Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are unobservable (Level 3) inputs and assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected term, and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of shares of WML common stock based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining term to maturity of the WML Convertible Bonds. The risk-free interest rate is based on the Hong Kong and United States benchmark yield curves on the valuation date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining term of the WML Convertible Bonds. The expected life of the WML Convertible Bonds is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining term to maturity. Dividend yield is assumed to be zero due to a dividend protection feature in the WML Convertible Bond agreement. The output of the lattice model can be highly sensitive to fluctuations in its inputs.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nA substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume. Our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers issued at our Las Vegas Operations and Encore Boston Harbor are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States, and United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.\nThe enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the United States varies from country to country. Some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome. We closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the United States. In addition to our internal credit and collection departments, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.\nWe regularly evaluate our reserve for credit losses based on a specific review of customer accounts and outstanding gaming promoter accounts, taking into consideration the amount owed, the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, management's experience with historical and current collection trends, current economic and business conditions, and management's expectations of future economic and business conditions and forecasts. Accounts are written off when management deems them to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. \n55 \nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (dollars in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nCasino accounts receivable\n$\n236,642 \n$\n218,694 \nAllowance for casino credit losses \n$\n34,676 \n$\n34,739 \nAllowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable\n14.7 \n%\n15.9 \n%\nThe decrease in allowance for casino credit losses as shown in the table above is primarily due to the impact of historical collection patterns and expectations of current and future collection trends, as well as the specific review of customer accounts. Although the Company believes that its allowance is adequate, it is possible the estimated amounts of cash collections with respect to receivables could change. Our allowance for credit losses is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the current and expected future state of the economy and our credit policy. Our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 40.3% and 41.8%, respectively, of our outstanding casino accounts receivable balance originated at our Macau Operations.    \nAs of December 31, 2024, a 100 basis point change in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for credit losses by approximately $2.4 million.\nAs our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated allowance for credit losses. Accordingly, the associated provision for credit losses may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a region's economy or legal system.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets, Intangible assets, and Goodwill\nWe evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards. For assets to be disposed of we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired. The Company’s test of goodwill impairment starts with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If qualitative factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. For the quantitative analysis, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill impairment is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.  The Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2024. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of the Company's decision to cease operating Wynn Interactive's digital sports betting and casino business, the Company identified interim indicators of impairment related to the goodwill assigned to the WynnBET reporting unit. As a result, the Company performed an impairment test as of December 31, 2023, and determined that the carrying value of its goodwill exceeded the estimated fair value of that reporting unit based on a combination of the income and cost approaches, causing the Company to recognize a goodwill impairment loss of $72.1 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no remaining goodwill recorded related to the acquisition of BetBull Limited (\"BetBull\"), a subsidiary of Wynn Interactive. The Company also recognized impairment of other finite-lived intangible assets related to Wynn Interactive's closed operations totaling $22.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n56 \nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, as a result of changes in forecasts and other industry-specific factors and management's decision to cease the operations of Betbull, the Company recognized impairment of goodwill and other finite-lived intangible assets of $37.8 million and $10.3 million, respectively. \nLitigation and Contingency Estimates\nWe are subject to various claims, legal actions and other contingencies, and we accrue for these matters when they are both probable and estimable. For matters that arose on or prior to the balance sheet date, we estimate any accruals based on the relevant facts and circumstances available through the date of issuance of the financial statements. We include the accruals associated with any contingent matters in other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSale-leaseback Transaction\nIn December 2022, the Company closed on a sale-leaseback arrangement with respect to certain real estate assets related to Encore Boston Harbor (the \"EBH Transaction\"). Upon closing of the EBH Transaction, the Company received cash proceeds of approximately $1.70 billion in exchange for the sale of such real estate assets, recognizing a gain on sale of $182.0 million, and concurrently entered into a lease agreement with respect to the sold assets for the purpose of continuing to operate the Encore Boston Harbor integrated resort. Upon entering into the lease agreement, the Company recognized an operating lease asset and a corresponding operating lease liability of $1.51 billion.\nAccounting for sale-leaseback transactions requires significant management judgement and estimates, including with respect to the determination of whether the transaction qualifies as a sale as defined within GAAP, operating versus finance lease classification, and inputs into the measurement of lease assets and liabilities. \nIn determining whether the transaction qualifies as a sale, we are required to assess whether a contract exists and if so, whether control has passed to the counterparty in the contract. Control indicators include, but are not limited to, whether the entity has a present right to payment for the asset, whether the customer has legal title to the asset, whether the entity has transferred physical possession of the asset, whether the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and whether the customer has accepted the asset. Concluding whether a sale has occurred requires significant judgement in determining whether the rights and obligations created by the sale agreement convey control to the counterparty in the transaction.\nIn a sale-leaseback arrangement, we are required to determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a finance lease. A finance lease would preclude sale accounting. A lessee is required to classify a lease as a finance lease if, among other factors, 1) the term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset or 2) the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. Lease terms include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that such option will be exercised. The Company’s operating lease related to Encore Boston Harbor contains an initial term of 30 years from December 2022 to November 2052 with one thirty-year renewal period at the Company’s option, which, in management judgement, is not considered to be reasonably certain of being exercised. The determination of whether the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset requires the use of estimates, in both determining the discount rate to measure the present value of the sum of the lease payments and in determining the fair value of the underlying assets. As the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate, which is defined by GAAP as the \"rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment,\" to determine the present value of lease payments. Inputs into our selected incremental borrowing rate which require management's judgement include quantifying our entity-specific credit risk and risks associated with the economic environment specific to the leased assets. In determining the fair value of the underlying assets, we use a combination of the income, market, and cost approaches, which include inputs such as estimated future cash flows, the selection of recently sold comparable properties, and estimated cost to construct a comparable asset.\n57 \nTable of Contents",
