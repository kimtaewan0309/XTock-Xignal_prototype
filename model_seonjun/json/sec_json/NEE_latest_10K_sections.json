  "item1": "Item 1.  Business\nOVERVIEW\nNEE is one of the largest electric power and energy infrastructure companies in North America and a leader in the renewable energy industry. At December 31, 2024, NEE had approximately 72 gigawatts of net generation and storage capacity from a diverse portfolio of assets, primarily including natural gas, wind, solar and nuclear generation facilities and battery storage facilities. NEE has two principal businesses, FPL and NEER. FPL is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. FPL’s strategic focus is centered on investing in generation, transmission and distribution facilities to deliver on its value proposition of keeping customer bills as low as possible and delivering high reliability, outstanding customer service and energy from diverse generation sources for the benefit of its more than\n \nsix million\n \ncustomer accounts. NEER is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun, as well as a world leader in battery storage capacity. NEER’s strategic focus is centered on the development, construction and operation of long-term contracted assets throughout the U.S. and Canada, primarily renewable generation facilities, and electric transmission facilities, as well as providing other energy solutions to its customers.\nAs described in more detail in the following sections, NEE seeks to create value in its two principal businesses by meeting its customers' needs more economically and more reliably than its competitors. NEE's strategy has resulted in profitable growth over sustained periods at both FPL and NEER. Management seeks to grow each business (see Note 15 – Commitments) in a manner consistent with the varying opportunities available to it; however, management believes that the diversification and balance represented by FPL and NEER is a valuable characteristic of the enterprise and recognizes that each business contributes to NEE's financial strength in different ways. FPL and NEER share a common platform with the objective of lowering costs, creating efficiencies and encouraging innovative ideas for their businesses. NEE and its subsidiaries, with employees totaling approximately 16,800 as of December 31, 2024, continue to develop and implement enterprise-wide initiatives focused on improving productivity, process effectiveness and quality. \nNEE's reportable segments for financial reporting purposes are FPL and NEER (see Note 16). NEECH, a wholly owned subsidiary of NEE, owns and provides funding for NEE's operating subsidiaries, other than FPL and its subsidiaries. The following diagram depicts NEE's simplified ownership structure:\n4\nTable of Content\ns\nFPL\nFPL is a rate-regulated electric utility engaged primarily in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in Florida. FPL is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. At December 31, 2024, FPL had 35,052 MW of net generating capacity, approximately 91,000 circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines and 921 substations. FPL provides service to its electric customers through an integrated transmission and distribution system that links its generation facilities to its customers. \nFPL serves approximately 12 million people through more than 6 million customer accounts. The following map shows FPL's service areas and plant locations as of February 14, 2025, which cover most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida and are in ten counties throughout northwest Florida (see FPL Sources of Generation below).\n5\nTable of Content\ns\nCUSTOMERS AND REVENUE\nFPL's primary source of operating revenues is from its retail customer base; it also serves a limited number of wholesale customers within Florida. The percentage of FPL's operating revenues and customer accounts\n \nby customer class were as follows:\nFor both retail and wholesale customers, the prices (or rates) that FPL may charge are approved by regulatory bodies, by the FPSC in the case of retail customers and by the FERC in the case of wholesale customers. In general, under U.S. and Florida law, regulated rates are intended to cover the cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Since the regulatory bodies have authority to determine the relevant cost of providing service and the appropriate rate of return on capital employed, there can be no guarantee that FPL will be able to earn any particular rate of return or recover all of its costs through regulated rates. See FPL Regulation below.\nFPL seeks to maintain rates that are as low as possible for its customers, while continuing to deliver reliable service. Since rates are largely cost-based, maintaining low rates requires a strategy focused on developing and maintaining a low-cost position, including the implementation of ideas generated from cost savings initiatives. \nFRANCHISE AGREEMENTS AND COMPETITION\nFPL's service to its electric retail customers is provided primarily under franchise agreements negotiated with municipalities or counties. During the term of a franchise agreement, which is typically 30 years, the municipality or county agrees not to form its own utility, \nand FPL has the right to offer electric service to residents. At \nDecember 31, 2024\n, FPL held 226 franchise agreements with various municipalities and counties in Florida with varying expiration dates through 2054. These franchise agreements cover the vast majority of FPL's retail customer base in Florida. At \nDecember 31, 2024\n, FPL also provided service to customers in 10 other municipalities and to 27\n \nunincorporated areas within its service area without franchise agreements pursuant to the general obligation to serve as a public utility. FPL relies upon Florida law for access to public rights-of-way. \nBecause any customer may elect to provide their own electric services, FPL effectively must compete for an individual customer's business. As a practical matter, few customers provide their own service at the present time since FPL's cost of service is lower than the cost of self-generation for a significant majority of customers. Changing technology (particularly increasing efficiency of solar power generation), tax incentives, economic conditions, regulatory changes, increasing cost-competitiveness of rooftop solar and battery storage and other factors could alter the favorable relative cost position that FPL currently enjoys; however, FPL seeks as a matter of strategy to ensure that it delivers superior value, in the form of customer bills as low as possible, high reliability, outstanding customer service and energy from diverse generation sources.\nIn addition to self-generation by residential, commercial and industrial customers, FPL also faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale and industrial customers and from alternative energy sources. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, operating revenues from wholesale and ind\nustrial electric customers combined represented approximately\n \n5%, 5% and 7%, respectively, of FPL's total operating revenues.\nFor the building of new steam and solar generating capacity of 75 MW or greater, the FPSC requires investor-owned electric utilities, including FPL, to issue a request for proposal (RFP) except when the FPSC determines that an exception from the RFP process is in the public interest. The RFP process allows independent power producers and others to bid to supply the new generating capacity. If a bidder has the most cost-effective alternative, meets other criteria such as financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and/or operating generating capacity of the type proposed, the investor-owned electric utility would seek to negotiate a PPA with the selected bidder and request that the FPSC approve the terms of the PPA and, if appropriate, provide the required authorization for the construction of the bidder's generating capacity.\n6\nTable of Content\ns\nFPL \nSOURCES OF GENERATION\nAt \nDecember 31, 2024\n, FPL's resources for serving load consisted of approximately 35,296 MW of net generating capacity, of which \n35,052\n MW were from FPL-owned facilities and \n244\n MW were available through PPAs. FPL owned and operated \n44\n units with generating capacity of 24,297 MW that primarily use natural gas and 96 solar generation facilities with generating capacity totaling 7,038 MW. In addition, FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated four nuclear units with net generating capacity totaling 3,502 MW (see Nuclear Operations below) and had a joint ownership interest in a coal unit located in Georgia which is operated by the joint owner with a net generating capacity of 215 MW (see Note 7 – Jointly-Owned Electric Plants). FPL also develops and constructs battery storage projects, which, when combined with its solar projects, serve to enhance its ability to meet customer needs for a nearly firm generation source. At \nDecember 31, 2024\n, FPL had 469 MW of battery storage capacity that delivers energy to the transmission system. FPL customer usage and operating revenues are typically higher during the summer months, largely due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in its service area. Occasionally, unusually cold temperatures during the winter months result in significant increases in electricity usage for short periods of time.\nIn 2024 and in January 2025, FPL continued to add new solar generation with cost recovery through base rates, through a Solar Base Rate Adjustment (SoBRA) and through SolarTogether\n®\n (a voluntary community solar program that gives FPL electric customers an opportunity to participate directly in the expansion of solar energy where participants pay a fixed monthly subscription charge and receive credits on their related monthly customer bill). FPL added new solar generation with capacity totaling 2,235 MW in 2024 and 894 MW in January 2025 (see FPL Regulation – FPL Electric Rate Regulation – Base Rates – Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 below). \nFuel Sources\nFPL relies upon a mix of fuel sources for its generation facilities, the ability of some of its generation facilities to operate on both natural gas and low sulfur diesel, and on purchased power to maintain the flexibility to achieve a more economical fuel mix in order to respond to market and industry\n developments. See discussion of solar generation additions above.\n*approximately 66% has dual fuel capability\nSignificant Fuel and Transportation Contracts.\n \nAt December 31, 2024, FPL had the following significant fuel and transportation contracts in place:\n•\nfirm transportation contracts with ten different transportation suppliers for natural gas pipeline capacity for an aggregate maximum delivery quantity of 2,836,000 MMBtu/day with expiration dates through 2042\n \n(see Note 15 – Contracts); \n•\nseveral contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates through 2039; and\n•\nshort- and medium-term natural gas supply contracts, with expiration dates through 2028, to provide a portion of FPL's anticipated needs for natural gas, with the remainder of FPL's natural gas requirements being purchased in the spot market.\n7\nTable of Content\ns\nNuclear Operations\nAt December 31, 2024, FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated the four nuclear units in Florida discussed below. FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages require the unit to be removed from service for variable lengths of time.\nFacility\nNet Generating Capacity\n(MW)\nBeginning of Next\nScheduled Refueling Outage\nOperating License\nExpiration Date\nSt. Lucie Unit No. 1\n981\nSeptember 2025\n2036\n(a)\nSt. Lucie Unit No. 2\n  840\n(b)\nApril 2026\n2043\n(a)\nTurkey Point Unit No. 3\n837\nFebruary 2026\n2052\n(c)\nTurkey Point Unit No. 4\n844\nMarch 2025\n2053\n(c)\n______________________\n(a)    In 2021, FPL filed an application with the NRC to renew both St. Lucie operating licenses for an additional 20 years.

An intervenor's appeal of the decision dismissing its proposed contentions against the license renewals is pending before the NRC.\nNRC regulations require FPL to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation. If the license renewals are approved by the NRC, FPL's plans provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be shut down in 2056 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 commencing in 2063. FPL's plans provide for the dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 with decommissioning activities commencing in 2052 and 2053, respectively.\nFPL's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel that is generated at these facilities through license expiration, as well as through any pending license extensions.\nFPL ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING\nFPL's Energy Marketing & Trading division (EMT) buys and sells wholesale energy commodities, such as natural gas, low sulfur diesel, electricity and renewable energy credits (RECs) from certain FPL solar generation assets. EMT procures natural gas and low sulfur diesel for FPL's use in power generation and sells excess natural gas, low sulfur diesel and electricity. EMT also uses derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. Substantially all of the results of EMT's activities are passed through to customers in the fuel or capacity clauses. See Management's Discussion – Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity and Note 3.\nFPL REGULATION\nFPL's operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal, state and other organizations, including, but not limited to, the following:\n•\nthe FPSC, which has jurisdiction over retail rates, service area, issuances of securities, and planning, siting and construction of facilities, among other things;\n•\nthe FERC, which oversees the acquisition and disposition of electric generation, transmission and other facilities, transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce, proposals to build and operate interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy, among other things;\n•\nthe NERC, which, through its regional entities, establishes and enforces mandatory reliability standards, subject to approval by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system blackouts;\n•\nthe NRC, which has jurisdiction over the operation of nuclear power plants through the issuance of operating licenses, rules, regulations and orders; and\n•\nthe EPA, which has the responsibility to maintain and enforce national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in some cases delegating authority to state agencies. The EPA also works with industries and all levels of government, including federal and state governments, in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.\n8\nTable of Content\ns\nFPL Electric Rate Regulation\nThe FPSC sets rates at a level that is intended to allow the utility the opportunity to collect from retail customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to its cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. To accomplish this, the FPSC uses various ratemaking mechanisms, including, among other things, base rates and cost recovery clauses.\nBase Rates\n.\n In general, the basic costs of providing electric service, other than fuel and certain other costs, are recovered through base rates, which are designed to recover the costs of constructing, operating and maintaining the utility system. These basic costs include O&M expenses, depreciation and taxes, as well as a return on investment in assets used and useful in providing electric service (rate base). At the time base rates are established, the allowed rate of return on rate base approximates the FPSC's determination of the utility's estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which \nincludes its costs for outstanding debt and an allowed return on common equity. The FPSC monitors the utility's actual regulatory ROE through a surveillance report that is filed monthly with the FPSC. The FPSC does not provide assurance that any regulatory ROE will be achieved. Base rates are determined in rate proceedings o\nr through negotiated settlements of those proceedings. Proceedings can occur at the initiative of the utility or upon action by the FPSC. Existing base rates remain in effect until new base rates are approved by the FPSC.\nBase Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025\n – In December 2021, the FPSC issued a final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2021 rate agreement).\nKey elements of the 2021 rate agreement, which is effective from January 2022 through December 2025, include, among other things, the following:\n•\nNew retail base rates and charges were established resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues:\n◦\n$692 million beginning January 1, 2022, and\n◦\n$560 million beginning January 1, 2023.\n•\nIn addition, FPL received base rate increases associated with the addition of up to 894 MW annually of new solar generation through the SoBRA mechanism in each of 2024 and 2025. FPL's recovery through the SoBRA mechanism was limited to an installed cost cap of $1,250 per kW. \n•\nFPL's authorized regulatory ROE was 10.60%, with a range of 9.70% to 11.70%. However, in the event the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate was 2.49% or greater over a consecutive six-month period, FPL was authorized to increase the regulatory ROE to 10.80% with a range of 9.80% to 11.80%. During August 2022, this provision was triggered and effective September 1, 2022, FPL's authorized regulatory ROE and ROE range were increased. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE falls below 9.80%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE rises above 11.80%, any party with standing may seek a review of FPL's retail base rates. \n•\nSubject to certain conditions, FPL may amortize, over the term of the 2021 rate agreement, up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus, provided that in any year of the 2021 rate agreement FPL must amortize at least enough reserve amount to maintain its minimum authorized regulatory ROE and also may not amortize any reserve amount that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of its maximum authorized regulatory ROE.\n•\nFPL is authorized to expand SolarTogether\n®\n by constructing an additional 1,788 MW of solar generation from 2022 through 2025, such that the total capacity of SolarTogether\n®\n would be 3,278 MW. \n•\nFuture storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kWh of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $4 surcharge. See Note 1 – Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery.\n•\nIf federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the 2021 rate agreement, FPL will prospectively adjust base rates after a review by the FPSC. \nIn March 2024, the FPSC issued a supplemental final order regarding FPL's 2021 rate agreement. The order affirmed the FPSC's prior approval of the 2021 rate agreement and is intended to further document, as requested by the Florida Supreme Court, how the evidence presented led to and supports the FPSC's decision to approve FPL's 2021 rate agreement. An April 2024 appeal of the order filed with the Florida Supreme Court by certain intervenors remains pending.\nFPL 2025 Base Rate Proceeding\n \n– On December 30, 2024, FPL filed a formal notification with the FPSC indicating its intent to initiate a base rate proceeding by submitting a four-year rate plan that would begin in January 2026 replacing the 2021 rate agreement. The notification states that, based on preliminary estimates, FPL expects to request a general base revenue requirement increase of approximately $1.55 billion effective January 2026 and a subsequent increase of approximately $930 million effective January 2027. The plan is also expected to request authority for a Solar and Battery Base Rate Adjustment mechanism to recover, subject to FPSC review, the revenue requirements associated with building and operating additional solar and battery storage projects in 2028 and 2029. In addition, FPL expects to propose an allowed regulatory ROE midpoint of 11.90% and to incorporate the continued application of FPL's longstanding equity ratio approved in prior base rate cases. FPL expects to file its formal request to initiate a base rate proceeding on or around February 28, 2025.\n9\nTable of Content\ns\nCost Recovery Clauses\n.\n Cost recovery clauses are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through these clauses. Cost recovery clause costs are recovered through levelized monthly charges per kWh or kW, depending on the customer's rate class. These cost recovery clause charges are calculated annually based on estimated costs and estimated customer usage for the following year, plus or minus true-up adjustments to reflect the estimated over or under recovery of costs for the current and prior periods. An adjustment to the levelized charges may be approved during the course of a year to reflect revised estimates. FPL recovers costs from customers through the following clauses:\n•\nFuel \n–\n primarily fuel costs, the most significant of the cost recovery clauses in terms of operating revenues (see Note 1 \n–\n Rate Regulation);\n•\nStorm Protection Plan \n–\n costs associated with an FPSC-approved transmission and distribution storm protection plan, substantially all of which includes costs for hardening of overhead transmission and distribution lines, undergrounding of certain distribution lines and \nvegetation management;\n•\nCapacity – primarily certain costs associated with the acquisition and retirement of several electric generation facilities (see Note 1 – Rate Regulation) and capacity payments related to PPAs; \n•\nEnergy Conservatio\nn \n–\n costs associated with implementing energy conservation programs; and\n•\nEnvironmental – certain costs of complying with federal, state and local environmental regulations enacted after April 1993 and costs associated with certain of FPL's solar facilities placed in service prior to 2016.\nThe FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. These costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when generation units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities.\nFERC\nThe Federal Power Act grants the FERC exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, electric utilities must file for FERC acceptance and maintain tariffs and rate schedules which govern the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services. Wholesale power sales tariffs on file at FERC may authorize sales at cost-based rates or, where the seller lacks market power, at market-based rates. The Federal Power Act also gives the FERC authority to certify and oversee an electric reliability organization with authority to establish and independently enforce mandatory reliability standards applicable to all users, owners and operators of the bulk-power system. See NERC below. Electric utilities are subject to accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements administered by the FERC. The FERC also places certain limitations on transactions between electric utilities and their affiliates.\nNERC\nThe NERC has been certified by the FERC as an electric reliability organization. The NERC's mandate is to ensure the reliability and security of the North American bulk-power system through the establishment and enforcement of reliability standards approved by FERC. The NERC's regional entities also enforce reliability standards approved by the FERC. FPL is subject to these reliability standards and incurs costs to ensure compliance with continually heightened requirements, and can incur significant penalties for failing to comply with them.\nFPL Environmental Regulation\nFPL is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below. FPL expects to seek recovery through the environmental clause for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations.\nFPL HUMAN CAPITAL\nFPL had approximately 9,300\n \nemployees at December 31, 2024, with approximately 31% of these employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers\n (IBEW). The collective bargaining agreements \nhave approximate\nly three-year terms and expire between\n March 2025 \nand April 2027.\n10\nTable of Content\ns\nNEER\nNEER,\n comprised of NEE's competitive energy and rate-regulated transmission businesses, is a diversified energy business with a strategy that emphasizes the development, construction and operation of long-term contracted assets with a focus on low-cost energy solutions. NEER is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun based on 2024\n MWh produced on a net generation basis, as well as a world leader in battery storage based on 2024 MW of net generating capacity. \nNEE reports NextEra Energy Resources and NEET, a rate-regulated transmission business, on a combined basis for segment reporting purposes, and the combined segment is referred to as NEER. The NEER segment owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets in the U.S. a\nnd Canada and also includes assets and investments in other clean energy businesses, such as battery storage and natural gas pipelines. NEER, with appr\noximately 33,410 MW of total net generating capacity\n \nat \nDecember 31, 2024\n, is one of the largest wholesale generators of electric power in the U.S., including approximately 32,890 MW of net generating capacity across \n41 \nstates and 520 MW of net generating capacity in 4 Canadian provinces\n.\n At\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \nNEER operates facilities, in which it has partial or full ownership interests, with a total generating capacity of approximately 41,500 MW. NEER primarily sells its capacity and/or energy output through \nlong-term power sales agreements with utilities, retail electricity providers, power cooperatives, municipal electric providers and commercial and industrial customers. \nNEER produces the majority of its energy from clean and renewable sources as described more fully below. In addition, NEER develops and constructs battery storage projects, which when combined with its renewable projects, serve to enhance its ability to meet customers' firm capacity needs, or as standalone facilities. The NEER segment also owns, develops, constructs and operates rate-regulated transmission facilities in North America with a total rate base of $2.7 billion at \nDecember 31, 2024\n. NEER's rate-regulated transmission facilities and the transmission lines that connect its electric generation facilities, including noncontrolling or joint venture interests, to the electric grid are comprised of approximately 370 substations and 3,885 circuit miles of transmission lines at \nDecember 31, 2024\n.\nNEER engages in energy-related commodity marketing and trading activities, including entering into financial and physical contracts. These contracts primarily involve power and fuel commodities and their related products for the purpose of providing full energy and capacity requirements services, primarily to distribution utilities in certain markets, and offering customized power and fuel and related risk management services to wholesale customers, as well as to hedge the production from NEER's generation assets that is not sold under long-term power supply agreements. In addition, NEER participates in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production through operating and non-operating ownership interests, and in pipeline infrastructure construction, management and operations, through noncontrolling or joint venture interests. NEER hedges the expected output from its natural gas and oil production assets to protect against price movements. During the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of selling ownership interests in certain natural gas and oil shale formations and in certain natural gas pipeline facilities (see Note 1 – Disposal of Businesses/Assets), NEER reassessed and changed its reporting unit structure to no longer report gas infrastructure as a separate reporting unit.\nCLEAN ENERGY AND OTHER OPERATIONS\nNEER sells products associated with its generation facilities (energy, capacity, RECs and ancillary services) in competitive markets in regions where those facilities are located. Customer transactions may be supplied from NEER generation facilities or from purchases in the wholesale markets, or from a combination thereof. See Markets and Competition below.\n11\nTable of Content\ns\nNEER's generation and battery storage projects, natural gas pipelines and transmission facilities (including noncontrolling or joint venture interests) at \nDecember 31, 2024\n are as follows: \n12\nTable of Content\ns\nClean Energy\n*Primarily natural gas\nGeneration Assets\nNEER's portfolio of generation assets primarily consists of generation facilities with long-term power sales agreements for substantially all of their capacity and/or energy output. Information related to contracted generation assets at December 31, 2024 was as follows:\n•\nrepresented approximately 31,569 MW of total net generating capacity; and \n•\nweighted-average remaining contract term of the power sales agreements of approximately 14 years, primarily based on forecasted contributions to earnings.\nNEER's merchant generation assets primarily consist of generation facilities that do not have long-term power sales agreements to sell their capacity and/or energy output and therefore require active marketing and hedging. Merchant generation assets at December 31, 2024 represented approximately 1,842 MW of total net generating capacity, including 805 MW from nuclear generation and 1,032 MW from other peak generation facilities, and are primarily located in the Northeast region of the U.S. NEER utilizes swaps, options, futures and forwards to lock in pricing and manage the commodity price risk inherent in power sales and fuel purchases.\n13\nTable of Content\ns\nNEER Generation Assets' Fuel/Technology Mix\nDuring \n2024\n, NEER generated approximately 111 million MWh utilizing the following mix of fuel \nsources for generation facilities in which it has an ownership interest: \n*Primarily natural gas\nWind Facilities\n•\nlocated in 23 states in the U.S. and 4 provinces in Canada;\n•\noperated a total generating capacity of approximately 26,335 MW, including capacity associated with noncontrolling and joint venture interests, at December 31, 2024;\n•\nownership interests in a total net generating capacity of approximately 20,977 MW at December 31, 2024; \n◦\nessentially all MW are contracted wind assets located primarily throughout Texas and the West and Midwest \nregions of the U.S. and Canada; \n◦\nincludes the impacts of approximately 1,365 MW of new generating capacity added\n \nin the U.S. in 2024 and an ownership interest in assets sold to a third party totaling approximately 536 MW (see Note 1 \n–\n Disposal of Businesses/Assets).\nSolar Facilities\n•\nlocated in 31 states in the U.S.;\n•\noperated photovoltaic and solar thermal facilities with a total generating capacity of approximately 10,157 MW, \nincluding capacity associated with noncontrolling and joint venture interests\n, at \nDecember 31, 2024\n;\n•\nownership interests in solar facilities with a total net generating capacity of approximately 7,837 MW at \nDecember 31, 2024\n;\n◦\nessentially all MW are contracted solar facilities located primarily throughout the West and South regions of the U.S.;\n◦\nincludes the impacts of approximately 2,507 MW of generating capacity added in the U.S. in 2024 and an ownership interest in assets sold to a third party totaling approximately 527 MW (see Note 1 \n–\n Disposal of Businesses/Assets).\nNuclear Facilities\nAt \nDecember 31, 2024\n, NextEra Energy Resources was the sole owner of the two Point Beach nuclear units shown in the table below and was the largest joint owner of the Seabrook nuclear facility shown in the table below. NEER's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications.

NRC regulations require plant owners to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation. NEER's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which, based on existing regulations, are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel that is generated at these facilities through current license expiration, as well as through any pending license extensions.\nNEER also maintains an approximately 70% interest in Duane Arnold, a nuclear facility located in Iowa that ceased operations in August 2020. NEER has a site-specific cost estimate and plan for decontamination and decommissioning on file with the NRC. All spent nuclear fuel housed onsite is in long-term dry storage until the DOE is able to take possession. In January 2025, NEER submitted a licensing path and exemption request with the NRC to explore the potential to recommission Duane Arnold. A recommissioning of Duane Arnold is contingent upon several factors including receipt of NRC regulatory approvals and approval of subsequent license renewal. In the event that Duane Arnold is not recommissioned, NEER estimates that the cost of decommissioning Duane Arnold is fully funded and would expect completion by approximately 2080.\nOther Clean Energy\nNEER's portfolio also includes assets and investments in other businesses with a clean energy focus, such as battery storage, natural gas pipelines and renewable fuels. At December 31, 2024, NextEra Energy Resources had net\n ownership interests in approximately \n3,379\n MW of battery storage capacity. \nIn addition, NextEra Energy Resources has equity method investments in four natural gas pipelines located in the Southeast region of the U.S., which total approximately 1,052 miles of pipeline. NextEra Energy Resources' net ownership interests represent noncontrolling interests ranging from approximately 33.3% to 85.0% in the pipelines and total net capacity of 1.67 Bcf per day. NextEra Energy Resources owns, or has a partial ownership interest in, a portfolio of 29 biogas projects, one of which is an operating renewable natural gas facility and the others of which are primarily operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities. \nPolicy Incentives for Clean Energy Projects\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of clean energy projects. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, PTCs, ITCs, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs. Pursuant to the U.S. federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, wind and solar generation facilities are depreciated for tax purposes over a five-year period even though the useful life of such facilities is generally much longer than five years.\nOwners of wind and solar facilities are eligible to claim an income tax credit (the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. Wind and solar generation facilities are eligible for 100% PTC or 30% ITC if such facilities start construction before the later of 2034 or the end of the calendar year following the year in which greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. electric generation are reduced by 75% from 2022 levels. The PTC is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the facility during the first ten years of commercial operation. A facility must also meet certain labor requirements to qualify for the 100% PTC or 30% ITC rate or construction must have started on the facility before January 29, 2023. In addition, the PTC is increased by 10% and the ITC rate is increased by 10 percentage points for facilities that satisfy certain tax credit enhancement requirements. Retrofitted wind and solar generation facilities may qualify for a PTC or an ITC if the cost basis of the new investment is at least 80% of the retrofitted facility’s total fair value.\nIn addition, the 30% ITC applies to energy storage projects placed in service after 2022 (previously, such projects qualified only if they were connected to and charged by a renewable generation facility that claimed the ITC) as well as certain property with respect to renewable natural gas facilities (including gas upgrading equipment) that are placed in service after 2022 and began construction before 2025. Energy storage projects and renewable natural gas facilities are eligible for a 10 percentage point increase in the ITC rate if the facilities satisfy certain tax credit enhancement requirements. \n15\nTable of Content\ns\nNuclear facilities placed in service before August 16, 2022, are eligible for a PTC of $3/MWh (increased to $15/MWh if certain prevailing wage requirements are satisfied) for electricity produced and sold after 2023 and before 2033. The PTC for these nuclear facilities begins to phase-out when gross receipts from electricity produced by the nuclear facility exceed $25/MWh and is completely phased-out when gross receipts exceed $43.75/MWh (subject to an annual inflation factor). Nuclear facilities placed in service after 2024 (including the restart of nuclear facilities previously in decommissioning) are eligible for the 100% PTC or 30% ITC, subject to the same requirements applicable to wind and solar facilities (discussed above).\nFor taxable years beginning after 2022, clean energy tax credits generated during the year can be transferred to an unrelated purchaser for cash, providing an additional path, along with sales of differential membership interests, for developers to monetize the value of clean energy tax credits.\nOther countries, including Canada, provide for incentives like feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy projects. The feed-in-tariffs promote renewable energy investments by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy producers, typically based on the cost of generation of each technology.\nOther Operations\nRate-Regulated Transmission \n– At December 31, 2024, certain entities within the NEER segment had ownership interests in rate-regulated transmission and related facilities.\nJurisdiction\nNEET's Rate Base\n(millions)\nMiles\nSubstations\nKilovolt\nLocation\nRate Regulator\nOwnership\nActual/Expected In-Service\nDates\nOperational:\nCAISO\n$1,166\n223\n9\n200\n(a)\n – 230\nCalifornia and Nevada\nFERC\n100%\n1960 \n–\n 2021\nERCOT\n$719\n354\n11\n345\nTexas\nPUCT\n100%\n2013\nIndependent Electricity System Operator (IESO)\n$294\n280\n–\n230\nOntario, Canada\nOEB\n48%\n2022\nNYISO\n$228\n20\n2\n345\nNew York\nFERC\n100%\n2021 – 2022\nSouthwest Power Pool (SPP)\n$89\n466\n18\n69 \n–\n 115 \nKansas and Oklahoma\nFERC\n100%\n(b)\n1960 \n–\n 2021\nOther\n$228\n70\n3\n161 \n–\n 345\nIllinois, Indiana, Kentucky and New Hampshire \nFERC\n100%\n(c)\n1953 – 1982\nUnder Construction:\nSPP\n(d)\n279\n–\n345\nKansas, Missouri, New Mexico and Oklahoma\nFERC\n100%\n2025 – 2026\nCAISO\n142\n6\n230 – 500\nCalifornia and Nevada\nFERC\n100%\n2027 – 2029\nPJM\n105\n1\n500\nMaryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia\nFERC\n100%\n2031\nERCOT\n43\n8\n138 – 345\nTexas\nPUCT\n100%\n2025 – 2028\n______________________\n(a)    Direct current \n(b)    Includes a 33-mile transmission line and 5 substations, in which NEET owns a 65% interest.\n(c)    Includes a substation, in which NEET owns an 88.3% interest.\n(d)    Includes a 48-mile transmission line that went into service in January 2025.\nCustomer Supply \n–\n \nNEER provides commodities-related products to customers, engages in energy-related commodity marketing and trading activities and includes the operations of a retail electricity provider and ownership interests in natural gas and oil shale formations located primarily in the South region of the U.S. Through NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiary, NextEra Energy Marketing, LLC, NEER:\n•\nmanages risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices and optimizes the value of NEER's power generation and natural gas and oil production assets through the use of swaps, options, futures and forwards;\n•\nsells output from NEER's plants that is not sold under long-term contracts and procures fuel for use by NEER's generation fleet;\n•\nprovides full energy and capacity requirements to customers; and\n•\nmarkets and trades energy-related commodity products, including power and fuel, as well as marketing and trading services to customers.\n16\nTable of Content\ns\nMARKETS AND COMPETITION\nElectricity markets in the U.S. and Canada are regional and diverse in character. All are extensively regulated, and competition in these markets is shaped and constrained by regulation. The nature of the products offered varies based on the specifics of regulation in each region. Generally, in addition to the natural constraints on pricing freedom presented by competition, NEER may also face specific constraints in the form of price caps, or maximum allowed prices, for certain products. NEER's ability to sell the output of its generation facilities may also be constrained by available transmission capacity, which can vary from time to time and can have a significant impact on pricing.\nThe degree and nature of competition is different in wholesale markets than in retail markets. A majority of NEER's revenues are derived from sales of energy, capacity, credits and ancillary products under long-term PPAs to customers located in wholesale electricity markets. Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants. NEER primarily competes on the basis of price, but believes the green attributes of NEER's generation assets, its track record of completing projects on schedule, its creditworthiness and its ability to offer and manage reliable customized risk solutions to wholesale customers are competitive advantages. Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies NEER competes with depending on the market. In wholesale markets, customers' needs are met through a variety of means, including long-term bilateral contracts, standardized bilateral products such as full requirements service and customized supply and risk management services.\nIn general, U.S. and Canadian electricity markets encompass three classes of services: energy and related energy credits, capacity and ancillary services. Energy services relate to the physical delivery of power; capacity services relate to the availability of MW capacity of a power generation asset; and ancillary services are other services that relate to power generation assets, such as load regulation and spinning and non-spinning reserves. The exact nature of these classes of services is defined in part by regional tariffs. Not all regions have a capacity services class, and the specific definitions of ancillary services vary from region to region.\nRTOs and ISOs exist throughout much of North America to coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic areas and to run markets. NEER operates in all RTO and ISO jurisdictions. At December 31, 2024, NEER also had generation facilities with a total net generating capacity of approximately 9,196 MW that fall within reliability regions that are not under the jurisdiction of an established RTO or ISO, including 5,806 MW within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council and 2,909 MW within the SERC Reliability Corporation. Although each RTO and ISO may have differing objectives and structures, some benefits of these entities include regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing larger wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity providers.\n17\nTable of Content\ns\nNEER has operations that fall within the following RTOs and ISOs\n:\nNEER competes in different regions to differing degrees, but in general it seeks to enter into long-term bilateral contracts for the full output of its generation facilities. At December 31, 2024, approximately 94% of NEER's net generating capacity was committed under long-term contracts. Where long-term contracts are not in effect, NEER sells the output of its facilities into daily spot markets. In such cases, NEER will frequently enter into shorter term bilateral contracts, typically of less than three years duration, to hedge the price risk associated with selling into a daily spot market. Such bilateral contracts, which may be hedges either for physical delivery or for financial (pricing) offset, serve to protect a portion of the revenue that NEER expects to derive from the associated generation facility. Contracts that serve the economic purpose of hedging some portion of the expected revenue of a generation facility but are not recorded as hedges under GAAP are referred to as “non-qualifying hedges” for adjusted earnings purposes. See Management's Discussion – Overview – Adjusted Earnings.\nCertain facilities within the NEER wind and solar generation portfolio produce RECs and other environmental attributes which are typically sold along with the energy from the plants under long-term contracts, or may be sold separately from wind and solar generation not sold under long-term contracts. The purchasing party is solely entitled to the reporting rights and ownership of the environmental attributes.\nWhile the majority of NEER's revenue is derived from the output of its generation facilities, NEER is also an active competitor in several regions in the wholesale full requirements business and in providing structured and customized power and fuel products and services to a variety of customers. In the full requirements service, typically, the supplier agrees to meet the customer's needs for a full range of products for every hour of the day, at a fixed price, for a predetermined period of time, thereby assuming the risk of fluctuations in the customer's volume requirements.\nExpanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for NEER. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient facilities \n18\nTable of Content\ns\nthat can sell power in competitive markets. NEER seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its facilities.\nNEER REGULATION\nThe energy markets in which NEER operates are subject to domestic and foreign regulation, as the case may be, including local, state and federal regulation, and other specific rules.\nAt December 31, 2024\n, essentially all of NEER's generation facilities\n located in the U.S. have received exempt wholesale generator status as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. Exempt wholesale generators own or operate a facility exclusively to sell electricity to wholesale customers. They are barred from selling electricity directly to retail customers. While projects with exempt wholesale generator status are exempt from various restrictions, each project must still comply with other federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, those regarding siting, construction, operation, licensing, pollution abatement and other environmental laws.\nAdditionally, most of the NEER facilities located in the U.S. are subject to FERC regulations and market rules and the NERC's mandatory reliability standards. All of NEER's facilities are subject to environmental laws and the EPA's environmental regulations, and its nuclear facilities are also subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. See FPL – FPL Regulation for additional discussion of FERC, NERC, NRC and EPA regulations. Rates of NEER's rate-regulated transmission businesses are set by regulatory bodies as noted in Clean Energy and Other Operations – Other Operations – Rate-Regulated Transmission. With the exception of facilities located in ERCOT, the FERC has jurisdiction over various aspects of NEER's business in the continental U.S., including the oversight and investigation of competitive wholesale energy markets, regulation of the transmission and sale of natural gas, and oversight of environmental matters related to natural gas projects and major electricity policy initiatives. The PUCT has jurisdiction, including the regulation of rates and services, oversight of competitive markets, and enforcement of statutes and rules, over NEER facilities located in ERCOT. In addition, certain of NEER's sales to retail customers are subject to consumer protection laws and other regulations related to consumer activities.\nCertain entities within the NEER segment and their affiliates are also subject to federal and provincial or regional regulations in Canada related to energy operations, energy markets and environmental standards. In Canada, activities related to owning and operating wind and solar projects and participating in wholesale and retail energy markets are regulated at the provincial level. In Ontario, for example, electric generation facilities must be licensed by the OEB and may also be required to complete registrations and maintain market participant status with the IESO, in which case they must agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions of the market rules for the Ontario electricity market as well as the mandatory reliability standards of the NERC. \nIn addition, NEER is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below. In order to better anticipate potential regulatory changes, NEER continues to actively monitor and participate in regional market stakeholder processes and other forums where changes to existing rules for the interconnection of renewable energy resources and the purchase and sale of energy commodities are under consideration.\nIn addition to regulation associated with operating assets, the development of energy infrastructure also involves additional and often extensive approvals and permitting requirements at the local, state and federal levels for items such as disturbing wetlands, obtaining no hazard determinations from the Federal Aviation Administration, interacting with wildlife, making wholesale sales of electricity, and other clearances. These requirements may change from time to time. For example, a federal executive order was issued in January 2025 that calls for a pause in federal land leasing, permitting and approvals for wind development facilities pending completion of a review of the federal rules providing for leasing, permitting and approvals for wind projects. This or similar initiatives could limit NEER’s and FPL's ability to obtain or renew necessary approvals, rights-of-way, permits, leases or loans for wind or other energy projects.\nNEER HUMAN CAPITAL\nNEER had approximately 7,400 employees at December 31, 2024. NEER has collective bargaining agreements with the IBEW, the Utility Workers Union of Amer\nica and the Security Police and Fire Professionals of America, which collectively repr\nesent approximately 6% of NEER's employees. The collective bargaining agreements have approximately\n three-to-four-year terms and expire between September 2025 and October 2028.\n19\nTable of Content\ns\nNEE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nNEE and its subsidiaries, including FPL, are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to, among others, air quality, water quality and usage, waste management, wildlife protection and historical resources, for the siting, construction and ongoing operations of their facilities. The U.S. government and certain states and regions, as well as the Government of Canada and its provinces, have taken and continue to take certain actions, such as proposing and finalizing regulations or setting targets or goals, regarding the regulation and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase of renewable energy generation. The environmental laws in the U.S., including, among others, the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA), provide for the protection of numerous species, including endangered species and/or their habitats, migratory birds, bats and eagles. The environmental laws in Canada, including, among others, the Species at Risk Act, provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are endangered or threatened and the management of species of special concern. Complying with these environmental laws and regulations could result in, among other things, changes in the design and operation of, and additional costs associated with, existing facilities and changes or delays in the location, design, construction and operation of new facilities. Failure to comply could result in fines, penalties, criminal sanctions or injunctions. NEE's rate-regulated subsidiaries expect to seek recovery for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations, which recovery for FPL would be through the environmental clause.\nWEBSITE ACCESS TO SEC FILINGS\nNEE and FPL make their SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on NEE's internet website, www.nexteraenergy.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after those documents are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
