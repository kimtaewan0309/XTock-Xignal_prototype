We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points, select beauty services, and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment. We define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast, a consumer who is passionate about the beauty category, uses beauty for self-expression, experimentation, and self-investment, and has high expectations for the shopping experience. We believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our financial performance.\nToday, we are the largest specialty beauty retailer in the United States and a leading destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care, hair care, wellness and salon services. Key aspects of our business include: a differentiated assortment of approximately 29,000 beauty products across a variety of categories and price points as well as a variety of beauty services, including salon services, in approximately 1,500 stores predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations; engaging digital experiences delivered through our website, Ulta.com, and our mobile applications; our best-in-class loyalty program that enables members to earn points for every dollar spent on products and beauty services and provides us with deep, proprietary customer insights; and our ability to cultivate human connection with warm and welcoming guest experiences across all of our channels. In addition to our domestic operations, Ulta Beauty is expanding our presence internationally through a joint venture in Mexico, a franchise in the Middle East, and our subsidiary, Space NK, a luxury beauty retailer operating in the U.K. and Ireland. \nThe continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales, net income, and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our strategic priorities across four foundational focus areas: 1) Assortment: curating the best of all things beauty and wellness for all beauty enthusiasts; 2) Experience: fostering authentic, empowering human connections that inspire, delight and engage guests at every touchpoint; 3) Loyalty: building lifelong loyalty and brand love through member growth and personalization; and 4) Access: engaging our guests wherever they want to shop by expanding our reach through seamless and immersive omnichannel experiences. We operate in an attractive and growing beauty products and salon services industry, and believe our strong operating model, competitive advantages, and financial foundation, paired with our investments to drive our growth, position us to capture additional market share in the industry. \nComparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry. Our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable sales, including general economic conditions, changes in merchandise strategy or mix, and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities, among others.\nOver the long term, our growth strategy is to drive profitable growth and market share leadership in beauty and wellness through growing our comparable sales, expanding omnichannel capabilities, and opening new stores. Long-term operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our efforts to drive revenue growth, leverage fixed costs, improve \n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmerchandise margin, increase operating efficiencies, and grow other revenue, partially offset by incremental investments in new stores and technology to enhance the guest experience, people, assortment, and advertising.\nCurrent Trends\nIndustry trend\ns\n​\nThe overall beauty market expanded in 2024 and into the second quarter of 2025, supported by on-going consumer engagement with the beauty category. We remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model, our commitment to strategic investments, and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains over the long term.\n​\nImpact of inflation and other macroeconomic trends\n \nPersistent inflationary and macroeconomic pressures, including existing and potential tariffs, have impacted consumer spending habits broadly, which we believe could contribute to lower sales trends throughout fiscal 2025. The continuation of inflationary and macroeconomic pressures, including existing and potential tariffs, could further impact our ability to grow sales and maintain historical profitability levels. In addition, inflation could cause the interest rates on any debt to remain at an elevated level or increase.\nBasis of presentation\nThe Company has one reportable segment, which includes retail stores, salon services, and e-commerce.  \nWe recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores. E-commerce sales are recognized upon shipment or guest pickup of the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control criteria. Retail store and e-commerce sales are recorded net of estimated returns. Shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer, which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup. We provide refunds for merchandise returns within 30 days from the original purchase date. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider our self a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting state sales tax. Salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest. Gift card sales revenue is deferred until the guest redeems the gift card. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Other revenue includes the private label and co-branded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with Target Corporation, and deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and gift card breakage.\nComparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation. Therefore, a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one-month grand opening period. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period. Comparable sales include retail sales, salon services, and e-commerce. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of comparable sales is included in the calculation. In the year following a 53-week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales.\nMeasuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy. Several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results:\n●\nthe general national, regional, and local economic conditions and corresponding impact on customer spending levels;\n●\nthe introduction of new products or brands;\n●\nthe location of new stores in existing store markets;\n●\ncompetition and/or alternative distribution channels;\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\nour ability to respond on a timely basis to changes in consumer preferences;\n●\nthe effectiveness of our various merchandising and marketing activities; and\n●\nthe number of new stores opened and the impact on the average age of all of our comparable stores.\n​\nCost of sales includes:\n●\nthe cost of merchandise sold, offset by vendor income that is not a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs;\n●\ndistribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance;\n●\nshipping and handling costs for e-commerce orders;\n●\nretail store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, and licenses;\n●\nsalon services payroll and benefits; and \n●\nshrink and inventory valuation reserves.\nOur cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open new stores. Changes in our merchandise or channel mix may also have an impact on cost of sales. This presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include:\n●\npayroll, bonus, and benefit costs for retail store and corporate employees;\n●\nadvertising and marketing costs, offset by vendor income that is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs;\n●\noccupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities;\n●\nstock-based compensation expense;\n●\ndepreciation and amortization for all assets, except those related to our retail stores and distribution operations, which are included in cost of sales; and\n●\nlegal, finance, information systems, and other corporate overhead costs.\nThis presentation of items in selling, general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses.\nPre-opening expenses include non-capital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new, remodeled, and relocated stores including rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores, store set-up labor, management and employee training, and grand opening advertising.\nInterest income represents interest from cash equivalents, which include highly liquid investments such as money market funds and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Interest expense includes interest costs and facility fees associated with our credit facilities, which is structured as an asset-based lending instrument. Interest on our credit facilities is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising or elevated interest rates. \nIncome tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores.\n​\nResults of operations\nOur quarterly periods are the 13 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. The Company’s second quarter in fiscal 2025 and 2024 ended on August 2, 2025 and August 3, 2024, respectively. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present the components of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n13 Weeks Ended\n​\n26 Weeks Ended\n​\n​\nAugust 2,\n​\nAugust 3,\n​\nAugust 2,\n​\nAugust 3,\n(Dollars in thousands)\n​\n2025\n    \n2024\n    \n2025\n    \n2024\nNet sales \n​\n$\n 2,788,469\n​\n$\n 2,552,087\n​\n$\n 5,636,836\n​\n$\n 5,277,935\nCost of sales\n​\n​\n 1,696,773\n​\n​\n 1,573,910\n​\n​\n 3,430,921\n​\n​\n 3,229,978\nGross profit\n​\n​\n 1,091,696\n​\n​\n 978,177\n​\n​\n 2,205,915\n​\n​\n 2,047,957\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n​\n​\n 741,737\n​\n​\n 644,821\n​\n​\n 1,452,350\n​\n​\n 1,310,734\nPre-opening expenses\n​\n​\n 5,105\n​\n​\n 4,155\n​\n​\n 6,934\n​\n​\n 7,074\nOperating income\n​\n​\n 344,854\n​\n​\n 329,201\n​\n​\n 746,631\n​\n​\n 730,149\nInterest income, net\n​\n​\n (1,413)\n​\n​\n (4,526)\n​\n​\n (4,960)\n​\n​\n (11,426)\nIncome before income taxes and equity net loss of affiliate\n​\n​\n 346,267\n​\n​\n 333,727\n​\n​\n 751,591\n​\n​\n 741,575\nIncome tax expense\n​\n​\n 84,795\n​\n​\n 81,171\n​\n​\n 184,439\n​\n​\n 175,906\nIncome before equity net loss of affiliate\n​\n​\n 261,472\n​\n​\n 252,556\n​\n​\n 567,152\n​\n​\n 565,669\nEquity net loss of affiliate\n​\n​\n 597\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n 1,225\n​\n​\n —\nNet income\n​\n$\n 260,875\n​\n$\n 252,556\n​\n$\n 565,927\n​\n$\n 565,669\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOther operating data:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNumber of stores end of period (1)\n​\n​\n1,473\n​\n​\n1,411\n​\n​\n1,473\n​\n​\n1,411\nComparable sales\n​\n​\n6.7%\n​\n​\n(1.2%)\n​\n​\n4.7%\n​\n​\n0.2%\n(1)\nExcludes 83 stores in the U.K. and Ireland operated by Space NK as of August 2, 2025.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n13 Weeks Ended\n​\n26 Weeks Ended\n​\n​\nAugust 2,\n​\nAugust 3,\n​\nAugust 2,\n​\nAugust 3,\n(Percentage of net sales)\n​\n2025\n    \n2024\n    \n2025\n    \n2024\nNet sales \n​\n​\n100.0%\n​\n​\n100.0%\n​\n​\n100.0%\n​\n​\n100.0%\nCost of sales\n​\n​\n60.8%\n​\n​\n61.7%\n​\n​\n60.9%\n​\n​\n61.2%\nGross profit\n​\n​\n39.2%\n​\n​\n38.3%\n​\n​\n39.1%\n​\n​\n38.8%\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n​\n​\n26.6%\n​\n​\n25.3%\n​\n​\n25.8%\n​\n​\n24.8%\nPre-opening expenses\n​\n​\n0.2%\n​\n​\n0.2%\n​\n​\n0.1%\n​\n​\n0.1%\nOperating income\n​\n​\n12.4%\n​\n​\n12.9%\n​\n​\n13.2%\n​\n​\n13.8%\nInterest income, net\n​\n​\n(0.1%)\n​\n​\n(0.2%)\n​\n​\n(0.1%)\n​\n​\n(0.2%)\nIncome before income taxes and equity net loss of affiliate\n​\n​\n12.4%\n​\n​\n13.1%\n​\n​\n13.3%\n​\n​\n14.1%\nIncome tax expense\n​\n​\n3.0%\n​\n​\n3.2%\n​\n​\n3.3%\n​\n​\n3.3%\nIncome before equity net loss of affiliate\n​\n​\n9.4%\n​\n​\n9.9%\n​\n​\n10.1%\n​\n​\n10.7%\nEquity net loss of affiliate\n​\n​\n0.0%\n​\n​\n0.0%\n​\n​\n0.0%\n​\n​\n0.0%\nNet income\n​\n​\n9.4%\n​\n​\n9.9%\n​\n​\n10.0%\n​\n​\n10.7%\n​\n​\n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\nComparison of 13 weeks ended August 2, 2025 to 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024\nNet sales\nNet sales increased $236.4 million, or 9.3%, to $2.8 billion for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2025 compared to $2.6 billion for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024. The net sales increase was primarily due to increased comparable sales, the acquisition of Space NK, and new store contribution. The comparable sales increase of 6.7% was driven by a\n \n3.7% increase in transactions and a\n \n2.9% increase in average ticket.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $113.5 million, or 11.6%, to $1.1 billion for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2025, compared to $978.2 million for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 39.2% for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2025, compared to 38.3% for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower inventory shrink and higher merchandise margin, partially offset by deleverage of supply chain costs and other revenue.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $96.9 million, or 15.0%, to $741.7 million for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2025, compared to $644.8 million for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 26.6% for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2025, compared to 25.3% for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024, primarily due to higher incentive compensation, store payroll and benefits, and corporate overhead. \nPre-opening expenses\nPre-opening expenses were $5.1 million for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2025 compared to $4.2 million for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024. \nInterest income, net\nInterest income, net was $1.4 million for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2025 compared to $4.5 million for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024. As of August 2, 2025, we had $289.1 million outstanding under our credit facilities. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facilities as of February 1, 2025 and August 3, 2024. \nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense of $84.8 million for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2025 represents an effective tax rate of 24.5%, compared to $81.2 million of income tax expense representing an effective tax rate of 24.3% for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024. \nNet income \nNet income was $260.9 million for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2025, compared to $252.6 million for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024. The increase in net income is primarily due to the $113.5 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by the $96.9 million increase in SG&A expenses, the $3.6 million increase in income taxes, the $3.1 million decrease in interest income, net, and the $1.0 million increase in pre-opening expenses.\nComparison of 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025 to 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024\nNet sales\nNet sales increased $358.9 million, or 6.8%, to $5.6 billion for the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025, compared to $5.3 billion for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024. The net sales increase was primarily due to increased comparable sales, the acquisition of Space NK, and new store contribution, partially offset by a $3.6 million decrease in other revenue. The comparable sales increase of 4.7% was driven by a\n \n2.6% increase in average ticket and a 2.1% increase in transactions. \n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\n​\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $158.0 million, or 7.7%, to $2.2 billion for the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025, compared to $2.0 billion for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 39.1% for the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025, compared to 38.8% for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower inventory shrink, higher merchandise margin, and favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by lower other revenue and deleverage of supply chain costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses increased $141.6 million, or 10.8%, to $1.5 billion for the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025, compared to $1.3 billion for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 25.8% for the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025, compared to 24.8% for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024, primarily due to deleverage of store payroll and benefits, higher incentive compensation and higher store expenses.\nPre-opening expenses\nPre-opening expenses were $6.9 million for the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025 compared to $7.1 million for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024. \nInterest income, net\nInterest income, net was $5.0 million for the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025 compared to $11.4 million for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024. As of August 2, 2025, we had $289.1 million outstanding under our credit facilities. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facilities as of February 1, 2025 and August 3, 2024.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense of $184.4 million for the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025 represents an effective tax rate of 24.5%, compared to $175.9 million of income tax expense representing an effective tax rate of 23.7% for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024. The higher income tax rate is primarily due to a reduced benefit from income tax accounting for stock-based compensation.\nNet income\nNet income was $565.9 million for the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025 compared to $565.7 million for the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024. The increase in net income is primarily due to the $158.0 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by the $141.6 million increase in SG&A expenses, the $8.5 million increase in income taxes, and the $6.5 million decrease in interest income, net.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our credit facilities. The most significant components of our working capital are merchandise inventories, cash and cash equivalents, and receivables, reduced by accounts payable, deferred revenue, and accrued liabilities. As of August 2, 2025, February 1, 2025, and August 3, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $242.7 million, $703.2 million, and $414.0 million, respectively. \nOur primary cash needs are for rent, capital expenditures for new, remodeled, and relocated stores, increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and new brand additions, supply chain improvements, share repurchases, and continued investment in our information technology systems.\nOur most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for lease expenses, inventory, labor, distribution, advertising and marketing, and tax liabilities) as well as periodic spend for capital expenditures, investments, and share repurchases. Our working capital needs are greatest from \n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAugust through November each year as a result of our inventory build-up during this period for the approaching holiday season. \nLong-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding lease expenses and other purchase commitments.\nWe generally fund short-term and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities. We believe our primary sources of liquidity will satisfy our cash requirements over both the short term (the next twelve months) and long term.\nCash flows\nWe believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths that give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n26 Weeks Ended\n​\n​\nAugust 2,\n​\nAugust 3,\n(In thousands)\n    \n2025\n    \n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n​\n$\n 316,543\n​\n$\n 358,879\nNet cash used in investing activities\n​\n​\n (559,911)\n​\n​\n (191,392)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n​\n​\n (217,088)\n​\n​\n (520,119)\nOperating activities\nOperating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expense, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the effect of working capital changes. \nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2025 compared to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2024 was mainly due to a larger increase in merchandise inventories in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2025 and the net increase in other assets and liabilities, partially offset by the timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  \nMerchandise inventories, net were $2.4 billion at August 2, 2025 compared to $2.0 billion at August 3, 2024, representing an increase of $408.8 million or 20.5%. The increase in total inventory is primarily due to the following:\n●\n$164 million for new brand launches; \n●\n$93 million for the addition of \n62\n net new Ulta Beauty stores opened since August 3, 2024; and\n●\n$77 million for the addition of 83 net new stores acquired with Space NK.\n​\nInvesting activities \nWe have historically used cash primarily for new, remodeled, relocated, and refreshed stores, supply chain investments, short-term investments, and investments in information technology systems. Investing activities for capital expenditures were $156.0 million during the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025, compared to $186.3 million during the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024. \nDuring the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025, we opened 30 new stores, closed two stores, relocated four stores, and remodeled nine stores, compared to the 26 weeks ended August 3, 2024, when we opened 29 new stores, closed three stores, relocated two stores, and remodeled nine stores.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2025 compared to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to the acquisition of Space NK in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur future investments will depend primarily on the number of new, remodeled, and relocated stores, information technology systems, and supply chain investments we undertake and the timing of these expenditures. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures.\nFinancing activities\nFinancing activities include share repurchases, borrowing and repayment of our short-term debt, and capital stock transactions. Purchases of treasury shares represent the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock. \nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2025 compared to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to borrowings from short-term debt and a decrease in the dollar amount of share repurchases.\nAs of August 2, 2025, we had $289.1 million outstanding under our credit facilities. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of February 1, 2025 and August 3, 2024. \nShare repurchase program\nIn March 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the March 2024 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company could repurchase up to $2.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. The March 2024 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amounts from the earlier share repurchase program. The March 2024 Share Repurchase Program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time.\nIn October 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the October 2024 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. The October 2024 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amounts from the March 2024 Share Repurchase Program. The October 2024 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n​\nA summary of common stock repurchase activity is presented in the following table:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n26 Weeks Ended  \n​\n​\nAugust 2,\n​\nAugust 3,\n(Dollars in millions)\n​\n2025\n    \n2024\nShares repurchased\n​\n​\n 1,231,292\n​\n​\n 1,137,856\nTotal cost of shares repurchased, including excise tax\n​\n$\n 472.4\n​\n$\n 501.8\n​\nCredit facility\nOn March 13, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (as so amended, the Loan Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder; Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent and a Lender; PNC Bank, National Association, as Documentation Agent and a Lender; and the other lenders party thereto.

The weighted average interest rate was 6.89% for the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2025. As of February 1, 2025 and August 3, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. As of August 2, 2025, we were in compliance with all terms and covenants of the Loan Agreement. \nUlta Beauty’s wholly owned subsidiary, Space NK, maintains a multi-currency revolving credit facility (the Facility Agreement) with National Westminster Bank plc, providing up to £40.0 million for working capital requirements. The Facility Agreement, maturing on April 17, 2028, allows Space NK to increase the revolving facility by an additional £10.0 million with lender consent. The facility is secured by the assets of Space NK and contains a requirement to maintain an interest coverage ratio not less than 4.0 to 1.0 and a leverage ratio not to exceed 2.0 to 1.0 for any relevant period. Borrowings bear interest at either the compound or term Sterling Overnight Index Average plus a margin of 1.75%, and an unused line fee of 0.60% per annum. As of August 2, 2025, there was $51.4 million outstanding under this credit facility. As of August 2, 2025, Space NK was in compliance with all terms and covenants of the Facility Agreement.\n​\nSeasonality\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day. Any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results for the entire fiscal year. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025. \n​"
