MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\n FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNote About Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report includes estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including the following sections: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q). These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” (Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-Q), and “Risk Factors”. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2025, and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).\nOVERVIEW\nMicrosoft is a technology company committed to making digital technology and artificial intelligence (“AI”) available broadly and doing so responsibly, with a mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We create platforms and tools, powered by AI, that deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.\nHighlights from the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 included:\n•\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue increased 26% to $49.1 billion.\n•\nCommercial remaining performance obligation increased 51% to $392 billion.\n•\nMicrosoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue increased 17%.\n•\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue increased 26%. \n•\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10%.\n•\nDynamics 365 revenue increased 18%.\n•\nAzure and other cloud services revenue increased 40%.\n•\nWindows OEM and Devices revenue increased 6%.\n•\nXbox content and services revenue increased 1%.\n•\nSearch and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 16%.\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\nPART I\nItem 2\n \n\n\nIndustry Trends and Opportunities\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\nMicrosoft and OpenAI Global, LLC (“OpenAI”) maintain a long-term strategic partnership originally established in 2019. Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI, and the companies have reciprocal revenue-sharing arrangements. We hold rights to OpenAI’s intellectual property, including models and infrastructure, for integration into our products.\n \nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.\nFurther, global, regional, and local economic developments and changes in global trade policies such as restrictions on international trade, including tariffs and other controls on imports or exports, could result in increased supply chain challenges, cost volatility, and consumer and economic uncertainty which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSeasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue is driven by a higher volume of multi-year contracts executed during the period.\nReportable Segments\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting.\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nPART I\nItem 2\n \n\n\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 16 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).\nMetrics\nWe use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, we made updates to our metrics to align with how we manage and monitor certain businesses. As part of these updates, Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers was removed as a metric.\nCommercial\nOur commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics products and cloud services, and Enterprise and partner services. Our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial remaining performance obligation\n\n\n \n\n\nCommercial portion of revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue and revenue growth\n\n\n \n\n\nRevenue from Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud, Azure and other cloud services, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, and Dynamics 365\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage\n\n\n \n\n\nGross margin percentage for our Microsoft Cloud business\n\n\n\n\n \nProductivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud\nMetrics related to our Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments assess the health of our core businesses within these segments.

Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, other income (expense), net included $4.1 billion and $688 million, respectively, of net losses from investments in OpenAI, primarily net recognized losses on our equity method investment.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nInterest and dividends income increased primarily due to higher portfolio balances and higher yields on debt securities. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher finance lease interest expense, offset in part by higher capitalization of debt interest expense. Net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to losses on equity securities in the current period as compared to gains in the prior period. Net gains on derivatives increased primarily due to gains on equity derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the prior period. Other, net primarily reflects net recognized losses on equity method investments, including OpenAI.\nINCOME TAXES\nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate was 19% for both the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was relatively unchanged compared to prior year as U.S. tax law changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act enacted on July 4, 2025 were offset by changes in the mix of our earnings and tax expenses between the U.S. and foreign countries.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of September 30, 2025, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S., some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our operations in Ireland remain subject to examination for tax years 2020 and thereafter.\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\nPART I\nItem 2\n \n\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted other income (expense), net, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude net losses from investments in OpenAI. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our financial performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions, except percentages\n \nand per share amounts)\n\n\n \n\n\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPercentage\nChange\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther income (expense), net\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(3,660\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(283\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1,193)%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet losses from investments in OpenAI\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,061\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n688\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n490%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted other income (expense), net (non-GAAP)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n401\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n405\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1)%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n27,747\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n24,667\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet losses from investments in OpenAI, net of tax\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,086\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n523\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n490%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n30,833\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n25,190\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiluted earnings per share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.72\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet losses from investments in OpenAI\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.41\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.07\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n486%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4.13\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.37\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $102.0 billion and $94.6 billion as of September 30, 2025 and June 30, 2025, respectively. Equity and other investments were $11.5 billion and $15.4 billion as of September 30, 2025 and June 30, 2025, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.\nValuation\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\nPART I\nItem 2\n \n\n\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\nCash Flows\nCash from operations increased $10.9 billion to $45.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and cash used to pay income taxes. Cash used in financing decreased $4.8 billion to $11.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to a $6.7 billion decrease in cash used for repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.5 billion increase in common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing increased $19.4 billion to $34.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025, primarily due to a $10.9 billion increase in cash used in net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, a $5.3 billion increase in other investing to facilitate the purchase of components, and a $4.5 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.\nDebt Proceeds\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 9 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include cloud services and Software Assurance (“SA”). Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of September 30, 2025:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In millions)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Ending\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 31, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n26,848\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 31, 2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19,044\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 30, 2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,770\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 30, 2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,325\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,546\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n61,533\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nIf our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Refer to Note 11 – Unearned Revenue of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\nPART I\nItem 2\n \n\n\nMaterial Cash Requirements and Other Obligations\nShare Repurchases\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we repurchased 8 million shares and 7 million shares of our common stock for $4.0 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase program. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of September 30, 2025, $53.4 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 14 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).\nDividends\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, our Board of Directors declared dividends totaling $6.8 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 14 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).\nOther Planned Uses of Capital\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We will continue to invest in capital expenditures to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure and training. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nRefer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\nJudgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (“SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\nPART I\nItem 2\n \n\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\nImpairment of Investment Securities\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.\nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\nPART I\nItem 2\n \n\n\nResearch and Development Costs\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a software product to be marketed or sold to external users are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\nPART I"
