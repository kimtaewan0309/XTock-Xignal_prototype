From our residential and commercial water solutions to industrial water managemen\nt and everything in between, Pentair is focused on smart, sustainable water solutions that help our planet and people thrive.\nPentair strategy\nOur vision is to be the world’s most valued sustainable water solutions company for our employees, customers and shareholders. As a company, we:\n•\nFocus on growth in our core businesses and strategic initiatives;\n•\nAccelerate digital innovation and technology as well as sustainability investments;\n•\nExpedite growth and drive margin expansion through our Transformation Program; and\n•\nBuild a high performance growth culture and deliver on our commitments while living our Win Right values.\nHISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT\nWe are an Irish public limited company that was formed in 2014. We are the successor to Pentair Ltd., a Swiss corporation formed in 2012, and Pentair, Inc., a Minnesota corporation formed in 1966 and our wholly-owned subsidiary, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Although our jurisdiction of organization is Ireland, we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and therefore have our tax residency in the U.K.\nOn December 2, 2024, as part of our Pool reportable segment, we completed the acquisition of G & F Manufacturing, LLC (“G & F Manufacturing”) for $116.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired and subject to customary adjustments. The net purchase price is comprised of an upfront cash payment of $108.0 million, subject to customary adjustments, and the estimated fair value at the acquisition date of a contingent earn-out liability based upon the achievement of certain defined operating results in the two years following the acquisition. G & F Manufacturing manufactures and services pool heat pumps. \nOur registered principal office is located at Regal House, 70 London Road, Twickenham, London, TW13QS United Kingdom. Our management office in the United States (“U.S.”) is located at 5500 Wayzata Boulevard, Suite 900, Golden Valley, Minnesota.\nBUSINESS AND PRODUCTS\nPentair is comprised of three reportable segments: Flow, Water Solutions and Pool. The following is a brief description of each of the Company’s reportable segments and business activities.\nFlow\nThe Flow segment aims to deliver water where it is needed, when it is needed, more efficiently and to transform waste into value. This segment designs, manufactures and sells a variety of fluid treatment and pump products and systems, including pressure vessels, gas recovery solutions, membrane bioreactors, wastewater reuse systems and advanced membrane filtration, separation systems, water disposal pumps, water supply pumps, fluid transfer pumps, turbine pumps, solid handling pumps, and agricultural spray nozzles, while serving the global residential, commercial and industrial markets. These products and systems are used in a range of applications, including fluid delivery, ion exchange, desalination, food and beverage, separation technologies for the oil and gas industry, residential and municipal wells, water treatment, wastewater solids handling, pressure boosting, circulation and transfer, fire suppression, flood control, agricultural irrigation and crop spray.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, our residential and irrigation flow businesses, which sell pumps focused on residential and agriculture, comprised approximately 37% of Flow sales. Another approximately 29% of Flow sales were from the commercial & infrastructure flow businesses, which sell larger pumps focused on fire suppression, water supply, wastewater and flood control. The remaining approximately 34% of Flow sales were from the industrial solutions business, comprised of applications focused on industrial process and air filtration and sustainable gas.\n1\nFlow brand names include Pentair Flow, Aurora, Berkeley, Codeline, Fairbanks-Nijhuis, Haffmans, Hydromatic, Hypro, Jung Pumpen, Myers, Sta-Rite, Shurflo, Südmo and X-Flow.\nCustomers\nFlow customers include businesses engaged with end users, and wholesale and retail distribution in the residential, agricultural, commercial, food and beverage, and industrial vertical markets.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically experienced increased demand following warm weather trends for residential water supply and agricultural products. Such demand historically has been at seasonal highs from April to August. Seasonal effects may vary from year to year and are impacted by weather patterns, particularly by temperatures, heavy flooding and droughts.\nCompetition\nFlow faces numerous domestic and international competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources directed to the vertical markets in which we compete. Competition focuses on brand names, product performance (including energy-efficient offerings and required specifications), quality, service and price. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and high-quality products, which we believe are competitively priced. \nWater Solutions\nThe Water Solutions segment aims to provide great tasting, higher-quality water and ice while helping people use water more productively. This segment designs, manufactures and sells commercial and residential water treatment products and systems including pressure tanks, control valves, activated carbon products, commercial ice machines, conventional filtration products, and point-of-entry and point-of-use water treatment systems. These water treatment products and systems are for use in residential whole home water filtration, drinking water filtration and water softening solutions in addition to commercial water management and filtration in foodservice operations. In addition, our water solutions business also provides installation and preventative services for water management solutions for commercial operators.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, our commercial business, which offers products such as conventional filtration products, commercial point-of-entry and point-of-use water treatment systems, activated carbon products and commercial ice machines, comprised approximately 66% of Water Solutions sales. In addition, our commercial business also provides installation and preventative services for water management solutions for commercial operators. The other approximately 34% of Water Solutions sales were associated with our residential business, which primarily focuses on products associated with residential point of entry and point of use filtration and softening systems, pressure tanks and control valves. \nWater Solutions brand names include Pentair Water Solutions, Everpure, Fleck, KBI, Manitowoc Ice, Pentek and RainSoft.\nCustomers\nWater Solutions customers include businesses engaged in wholesale and retail distribution in the residential, commercial and food and beverage vertical markets. Customers also include end users, consumers, commercial operators and original equipment manufacturers. \nSeasonality\nWe experience seasonal demand with several end customers and end users within Water Solutions. End-user demand for water solution products generally follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to September.\nCompetition\nWater Solutions faces numerous domestic and international competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources directed to the vertical markets in which we compete. Competition focuses on brand names, product performance (including required specifications), quality and price. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and high-quality products, which we believe are competitively priced. We believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality also provide us a competitive advantage.\nPool\nThe Pool segment aims to provide innovative, energy-efficient pool solutions to help people more sustainably enjoy water. This segment designs, manufactures and sells a complete line of energy-efficient residential and commercial pool equipment and accessories including pumps, filters, heaters, lights, automatic controls, automatic cleaners, maintenance equipment and pool accessories. Applications for our pool products include residential and commercial pool maintenance, pool repair, renovation, service, construction and aquaculture solutions.\nThe primary brand names associated with the Pool segment are Pentair Pool, Kreepy Krauly, Pleatco and Sta-Rite.\n2\nCustomers\nPool customers include businesses engaged in wholesale and retail distribution in the residential and commercial vertical markets. Customers in the residential and commercial verticals also include end users and consumers.\nOne customer in the Pool business represented approximately 15% of our consolidated net sales in both 2024 and 2023.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically experienced seasonal demand with several end customers and end users. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and historically has been at seasonal highs from April to August. The magnitude of the sales spike has historically been partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs (generally including extended payment terms and/or additional discounts). \nCompetition\nPool faces numerous domestic and international competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources directed to the vertical markets in which we compete. Competition focuses on brand names, product performance (including energy-efficient offerings and required specifications), quality, service and price. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and high-quality products, which we believe are competitively priced. We believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality also provide us a competitive advantage.\nINFORMATION REGARDING ALL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS\nResearch and development\nWe conduct research and development activities primarily in our own facilities. These efforts consist mostly of the development of new products, product applications and manufacturing processes.\nRaw materials\nThe principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are mild steel, stainless steel, electronic components (including drives and motors), plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies), metals and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for distribution for resale.\nWe purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market. We believe the majority of such materials are available through multiple sources and in adequate supply. We have certain long-term commitments, principally price commitments, for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and continue to work with our suppliers to maintain delivery continuity. Alternate sources of supply are available for most materials and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nCertain commodities, such as metals and resins, are subject to commodity market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances. Prices for raw materials, such as metals, may trend higher in the near future due to the volatile market trends.\nIntellectual property\nPatents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies, customer relationships, trademarks, trade names and brand names are important to our business. However, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer relationship, trademark, trade name or brand name.\nPatents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of patents, patent applications or license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nHuman capital resources\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain strong employees. We believe a deep-rooted culture energizes our employees to make a difference within and beyond the workplace. We strive to be the destination for top talent, and work hard to develop and retain high performers throughout their career. We also believe our Win Right values, positive culture and commitment to inclusion and diversity foster innovation and curiosity, which, in turn, can contribute to us being an industry leader.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 9,750 employees worldwide, of which approximately 50% are located in the U.S. A small portion of our U.S. employees are unionized. Outside the U.S. we have employees in certain countries, primarily in Europe, who are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.\n3\nEmployee engagement and development\nWe believe engaging our employees and developing their careers is important to our long-term success and ties directly to our Win Right culture and values. We support our Win Right culture by providing dedicated culture training to our employees globally.\n \nWe engage with our employees and gather feedback about our employee programs, practices and policies through various approaches that include town hall meetings where Pentair leaders share strategies and perspectives and answer questions; quarterly leadership meetings to communicate our results and expectations; and an annual senior leadership meeting to drive growth and productivity initiatives, share best practices, and invest in our leaders. In addition, we conduct employee engagement and pulse surveys during the year to gauge the level of engagement and potential actions needed on culture, the business, employee experience and retention.\n \nWe believe in transparency with our employees and provide the results of those surveys to the manager level and above which drive the development of action plans.\nTraining and development\nTo support employees in their career journey, we have developed and shared through our dedicated development site, a number of tools and resources. We offer career pathing and development resources for all functions throughout Pentair. We support development annually with a dedicated career week, individual development planning and targeted development experiences supported through live training sessions; on-demand eLearning, virtual classrooms and downloadable materials. Additionally, our annual talent management process supports employees to set objectives, receive feedback and development, and build development plans with their leaders.\nOur talent development efforts span across various levels of our organization, including our early career Leadership Development Program, a 36-month program in which potential future leaders participate in rotations intended to develop their capabilities through organization-wide exposure, and our Growth Manager development programs that prepare our new and experienced managers to be more effective and inclusive leaders at Pentair. \nInclusion\nOur commitment to inclusion is part of living our Win Right values. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, engage, develop and retain our employees, which includes diverse employees from an array of backgrounds. We believe an inclusive and diverse workforce contributes different perspectives and innovative ideas that enable us to improve. We believe that every employee should be provided the same opportunity to be heard, respected, have a sense of belonging and contribute to our mission. Our Business Resource Groups, which are open to everyone, have been established to help promote a culture of inclusion by providing an additional forum for employee feedback, such as sharing insights that could help the business improve, and sponsoring awareness, education and engagement.\nWe take an integrated approach to supporting and promoting workplace inclusion by fostering a globally aware, inclusive culture; and reinforcing our practices to be fair and nondiscriminatory. We have various training and organizational approaches dedicated to fostering inclusion, including a training called the “The Power of Inclusion;” Business Resource Groups led by employees; Pentair’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; and other resources on our company’s intranet.\nHealth, safety and wellness\nWe are committed to providing a safe workplace for all of our employees. We encourage employees to “Stop Work” anytime there is a potential concern regarding worker safety, and promote an open door policy so that all of our employees feel free to speak to their manager if there are any potential health, safety, compliance or sustainability concerns. Additionally, each site maintains a confidential reporting process, and we encourage the use of the Ethics Hotline for employees to report anonymously potential safety concerns. All locations, enterprise wide, are required to meet regulatory agency standards as applicable to each site’s location.\nCompensation and benefits\nIn the U.S., non-union full-time employees are eligible to receive the following benefits: short-term and long-term disability insurance; flexible and health savings accounts and wellness programs; health insurance (medical, pharmacy, dental); eight weeks paid parental leave for birth, adoptive and foster parents; two weeks paid caregiver leave; legal services; retirement benefits; employee stock purchase plan; tuition reimbursement; holidays; vacation and sick time. Benefits for union employees and employees of G & F Manufacturing, which was acquired on December 2, 2024, may vary.\n4\nSustainability Activities\nAs a leading provider of smart, sustainable water solutions and with a foundation of Win Right values, we recognize that the work we do and the products and services we provide help to improve lives and the environment around the world. We are focused on building on our Win Right values and culture by further contributing to the development of a sustainable and responsible society that we believe will also drive our future growth. We are also focused on further integrating our sustainability goals throughout our business by creating accountability for our sustainability strategy and shared commitments. We have established formal sustainability programs to further advance our sustainability goals. \nIn 2023, Pentair completed an Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) assessment in alignment with the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”). This assessment supported the topics focused on in our first set of social responsibility strategic targets, which we announced in 2021. These strategic targets remained in effect through 2024 and reflected the Company’s social responsibility focus areas. Also in alignment with the CSRD, in 2025 we are conducting an updated sustainability assessment, and expect to use the results of this updated assessment for continued sustainability strategic planning and risk management, as well as to determine future focus areas, targets, goals and disclosure requirements under the CSRD.\nAnnually, we publish a corporate responsibility/sustainability report on our sustainability activities and accomplishments, which can be found on our corporate website, and which is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee ITEM 1A “Risk Factors –\n \nWe are exposed to environmental laws, liabilities and litigation.”\nCaptive insurance subsidiary\nA portion of our property and casualty insurance program is insured through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. Accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties, such as liabilities arising from acquired businesses, pre-Penwald liabilities and those of certain non-U.S. operations, are established.\nMatters pertaining to Penwald are discussed in ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Insurance subsidiary, included in this Form 10-K.\nAvailable information\nWe make available free of charge (other than an investor’s own Internet access charges) through our Internet website (\nhttps://www.pentair.com\n) our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. Pentair assumes no obligation, and disclaims any obligation, to update the information contained in this report.\nOverview\nPentair plc and its consolidated subsidiaries (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Pentair” or the “Company”) is a pure play water industrial manufacturing company comprised of three reportable segments: Flow, Water Solutions and Pool. We classify our operations into business segments based primarily on types of products offered and markets served. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Flow, Water Solutions and Pool reportable segments represented approximately 37%, 28% and 35% of total consolidated net sales, respectively. \nAlthough our jurisdiction of organization is Ireland, we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and therefore have our tax residency in the U.K.\nOn December 2, 2024, as part of our Pool reportable segment, we completed the acquisition of G & F Manufacturing, LLC (“G & F Manufacturing”) for $116.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired and subject to customary adjustments. The net purchase price is comprised of an upfront cash payment of $108.0 million, subject to customary adjustments, and the estimated fair value at the acquisition date of a contingent earn-out liability based upon the achievement of certain defined operating results in the two years following the acquisition. G & F Manufacturing manufactures and services pool heat pumps. \nKey trends and uncertainties regarding our existing business\nThe following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2024, and are reasonably likely to impact our results in the future:\n•\nWe have a Transformation Program designed to accelerate growth and drive margin expansion by driving operational excellence, reducing complexity and streamlining our processes. During 2024, we made strategic progress on our Transformation Program initiatives with a focus on our four key themes of pricing excellence, strategic sourcing, operations excellence and organizational effectiveness. We expect to continue to execute on our key Transformation Program initiatives to drive margin expansion and to continue to incur transformation costs in 2025 and beyond.\n•\nIn 2024, we began using 80/20 guiding principles to enable our Transformation Program. This 80/20 analysis is expected to create value by focusing on key customers and products through quadrant-based strategies. We expect the analysis to result in actions to improve operating performance by driving growth with our highest value customers, reducing lower margin sales and removing complexity in the future.\n•\nIn 2024, we executed certain business restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business. We expect these actions to continue into 2025 and to drive margin growth.\n24\n•\nDuring 2024, we experienced inflationary cost increases for certain raw materials as well as logistics and transportation costs. The ongoing volatile market for commodities has the potential to continue to drive price increases in our supply chain. In addition, the current U.S. administration has recently implemented tariffs and has announced the possibility of implementing additional, or increasing current, tariffs; these actions and any reactionary tariff adjustments by other countries may also contribute to inflationary cost increases. As a result, we have taken pricing actions, which may continue going forward, and implemented transformation initiatives that we expect to improve productivity and offset cost increases. We anticipate supply chain pressures and inflationary cost increases due to potential tariffs and pressure on global manufacturing to continue into 2025.\n•\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), for a global 15.0% minimum tax, have been adopted by a number of jurisdictions in which we operate. Pillar Two has negatively impacted our effective tax rate in 2024 and is likely to continue to impact our effective tax rate in the future. We continue to evaluate the enacted legislative changes and new guidance as it becomes available.\n•\nWe have identified specific product and geographic market opportunities that we find attractive and continue to pursue, both within and outside the U.S. We expect to continue investing in our businesses to drive these opportunities through research and development and additional sales and marketing resources. Unless we successfully penetrate these markets, our core sales growth will likely be limited or may decline.\nIn 2025, our operating objectives focus on delivering our core and building our future. We expect to execute these objectives by:\n•\nDelivering profitable revenue growth and productivity for customers and shareholders; \n•\nContinuing to focus on capital allocation through:\n◦\nCommitting to maintain our investment grade rating; \n◦\nFocusing on reducing our long-term debt;\n◦\nReturning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and\n◦\nAccelerating our performance with strategically-aligned mergers and acquisitions;\n•\nFocusing growth initiatives that accelerate our investments in digital, innovation, technology and sustainability;\n•\nContinuing to implement our Transformation Program initiatives that will drive operational excellence, reduce complexity and improve our organizational structure, which includes the focus on 80/20 actions to drive profitable growth; and\n•\nBuilding a high performance growth culture and delivering on our commitments while living our Win Right values.\n25\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe consolidated results of operations were as follows:\nYears ended December 31\n% / point change\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023\n2023 vs 2022\nNet sales\n$\n4,082.8 \n$\n4,104.5 \n$\n4,121.8 \n(0.5)\n%\n(0.4)\n%\nCost of goods sold\n2,484.0 \n2,585.3 \n2,757.2 \n(3.9)\n%\n(6.2)\n%\nGross profit\n1,598.8 \n1,519.2 \n1,364.6 \n5.2 \n%\n11.3 \n%\n% of net sales\n39.2 \n%\n37.0 \n%\n33.1 \n%\n2.2 \n pts\n3.9 \n pts\nSelling, general and administrative\n701.4 \n680.2 \n677.1 \n3.1 \n%\n0.5 \n%\n% of net sales\n17.2 \n%\n16.6 \n%\n16.4 \n%\n0.6 \n pts\n0.2 \n pts\nResearch and development\n93.6 \n99.8 \n92.2 \n(6.2)\n%\n8.2 \n%\n% of net sales\n2.3 \n%\n2.4 \n%\n2.2 \n%\n(0.1)\n pts\n0.2 \n pts\nOperating income\n803.8 \n739.2 \n595.3 \n8.7 \n%\n24.2 \n%\n% of net sales\n19.7 \n%\n18.0 \n%\n14.4 \n%\n1.7 \n pts\n3.6 \n pts\nNet interest expense\n88.6 \n118.3 \n61.8 \n(25.1)\n%\n91.4 \n%\nOther (income) expense\n(3.7)\n2.0 \n(17.1)\nN.M.\nN.M.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes\n718.9 \n618.9 \n550.6 \n16.2 \n%\n12.4 \n%\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n93.3 \n(4.0)\n67.4 \nN.M.\nN.M.\n   Effective tax rate\n13.0 \n%\n(0.6)\n%\n12.2 \n%\n13.6 \n pts\n(12.8)\n pts\nN.M.

However, such discussion is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our three reportable segments (Flow, Water Solutions and Pool). Each of these segments comprises various product offerings that serve multiple end users.\nWe evaluate performance based on net sales and reportable segment income (“segment income”) and use certain ratios, particularly return on sales, to measure performance of our reportable segments. Segment income represents operating income of each reportable segment inclusive of equity income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and exclusive of intangible amortization, certain acquisition related expenses, costs of restructuring and transformation activities, impairments, legal accrual adjustments and settlements and other unusual non-operating items.\nFlow\nThe net sales and segment income for Flow were as follows:\nYears ended December 31\n% / point change\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs 2023\n2023 vs 2022\nNet sales\n$\n1,514.0 \n$\n1,582.1 \n$\n1,500.8 \n(4.3)\n%\n5.4 \n%\nSegment income\n318.1 \n282.3 \n242.3 \n12.7 \n%\n16.5 \n%\n% of net sales\n21.0 \n%\n17.8 \n%\n16.1 \n%\n3.2 \n  pts\n1.7 \n  pts\nNet sales\nThe components of the change in Flow net sales were as follows:\n2024 vs 2023\n2023 vs 2022\nVolume\n(6.0)\n%\n(2.0)\n%\nPrice\n1.7 \n7.1 \n   Core growth\n(4.3)\n5.1 \nCurrency\n— \n0.3 \nTotal\n(4.3)\n%\n5.4 \n%\nThe 4.3 percent decrease in net sales for Flow in 2024 from 2023 was primarily the result of:\n•\ndecreased sales volume in our residential flow and industrial solutions businesses compared to the prior year.\nThe decrease was partially offset by:\n•\nincreased selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases;

A portion of our backlog, particularly from orders for major capital projects, can take more than one year from order to delivery depending on the size and type of order. We record, as part of our backlog, all orders from external customers, which represent firm commitments, and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract. Our backlog of orders is dependent upon when customers place orders and is not necessarily an indicator of our expected results for our 2025 net sales. The decrease in our overall backlog from the prior year was primarily driven by our backlog trending down to more historical levels as a result of increased manufacturing capacity and improved lead times within each of our reportable segments as well as timing of delivery of orders associated with certain advance sale (“early buy”) programs within our Pool segment. \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe generally fund cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, equity investments, acquisitions, debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations, availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances, public and private debt and equity offerings. Our primary revolving credit facility has generally been adequate for these purposes, although we have negotiated additional credit facilities or completed debt and equity offerings as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions. \nWe experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets. Consistent with historical trends, we experienced seasonal cash usage in the first quarter of 2024 and drew on our revolving credit facility to fund our operations. This cash usage reversed in the second quarter of 2024 as the seasonality of our businesses peaked and generated significant cash to fund our operations. In the second half of 2024, we funded our operations using our strong cash flow and revolving credit facility.\nEnd-user demand for pool equipment in the Pool segment, water solution products in the Water Solutions segment, and residential water supply and agricultural products within the Flow segment follows warm weather trends, with seasonal highs ranging from April to September. The magnitude of the sales spike has historically been partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs (generally including extended payment terms and/or additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly by temperature, heavy flooding and droughts. \n31\nOn December 2, 2024, as part of our Pool reportable segment, we completed the acquisition of G & F Manufacturing for approximately $116.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired, including an upfront cash payment of $108.0 million. We funded the purchase price for this acquisition with cash on hand. \nSummary of Cash Flows\nYears ended December 31\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash provided by (used for):\n   Operating activities of continuing operations\n$\n766.9 \n$\n620.8 \n$\n364.3 \n   Investing activities\n(187.6)\n(85.4)\n(1,582.8)\n   Financing activities\n(636.7)\n(468.1)\n1,232.7\nOperating activities\nIn 2024, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations primarily reflects net income from continuing operations, net of non-cash depreciation, definite-lived intangible amortization and asset impairment, of $757.8 million.\nIn 2023, net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations primarily reflects net income from continuing operations, net of non-cash depreciation, definite-lived intangible amortization, asset impairment and deferred income taxes, of $653.1 million. Additionally, we had a cash outflow of $61.3 million as a result of changes in net working capital, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and decreases in accounts payable and other current liability balances, partially offset by lower inventory compared to December 31, 2022. Decreases in inventory and accounts payable were primarily related to supply chain efficiencies and improved lead times.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2024 primarily reflects net cash paid of $108.0 million for the acquisition of G & F Manufacturing, capital expenditures of $74.4 million and cash paid upon the settlement of net investment hedges of $5.8 million.\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2023 primarily reflects capital expenditures of $76.0 million and cash paid upon the settlement of net investment hedges of $18.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $5.6 million. \nFinancing activities\nIn 2024, net cash used for financing activities primarily relates to the repayment of $200.0 million of term loans under the Senior Credit Facility (as defined below), $162.5 million of principal payments on the Term Loan Facility (as defined below), dividend payments of $152.3 million and share repurchases of $150.0 million.\nIn 2023, net cash used for financing activities primarily relates to net repayments of revolving long-term debt of $320.0 million and dividend payments of $145.2 million.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure our free cash flow. We have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that is equal to 100 percent conversion of net income. Free cash flow is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of liquidity because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends, repurchase shares and repay debt. In addition, free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensation-based incentives. Our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \n32\nThe following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow:\n \nYears ended December 31\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations\n$\n766.9 \n$\n620.8 \n$\n364.3 \nCapital expenditures of continuing operations\n(74.4)\n(76.0)\n(85.2)\nProceeds from sale of property and equipment of continuing operations\n0.6 \n5.6 \n4.1 \nFree cash flow from continuing operations\n$\n693.1 \n$\n550.4 \n$\n283.2 \nNet cash used for operating activities of discontinued operations\n(0.2)\n(1.6)\n(1.0)\nFree cash flow\n$\n692.9 \n$\n548.8 \n$\n282.2 \nDebt and Capital\nPentair, Pentair Finance S.à r.l (“PFSA“) and Pentair, Inc. are parties to a credit agreement (the “Senior Credit Facility”), with Pentair as guarantor and PFSA and Pentair, Inc. as borrowers, providing for a $900.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. During 2024, PFSA repaid $200.0 million of term loans under the Senior Credit Facility. The revolving credit facility has a maturity date of December 16, 2026. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an alternate base rate, adjusted term secured overnight financing rate, adjusted euro interbank offered rate, adjusted daily simple secured overnight financing rate or central bank rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on, at PFSA’s election, Pentair’s leverage level or PFSA’s public credit rating. \nAs of December 31, 2024, total availability under the Senior Credit Facility was $890.5 million. In addition, PFSA has the option to request to increase the revolving credit facility and/or to enter into one or more additional tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount of up to $300.0 million, subject to customary conditions, including the commitment of the participating lenders.\nIn addition, Pentair and PFSA are parties to a senior unsecured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”), with PFSA, as borrower, Pentair, as guarantor, providing for an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. The Term Loan Facility has a maturity date of July 28, 2027, with required quarterly installment payments of $6.3 million which began on the last day of the third quarter of 2023 and increased to $12.5 million on the last day of the third quarter of 2024. During 2024, PFSA repaid the remaining $162.5 million of quarterly installments on the Term Loan Facility, such that PFSA is not required to make any further quarterly installment payments. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining obligation of $825.0 million matures on July 28, 2027. The Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate equal to an alternate base rate, adjusted term secured overnight financing rate, or adjusted daily simple secured overnight financing rate, plus, in \neach case, an applicable margin. \nThe applicable margin is based on, at PFSA’s election, Pentair’s leverage level or PFSA’s public credit rating.\nOur debt agreements contain various financial covenants, but the most restrictive covenants are contained in the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. The Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility contain covenants requiring us not to permit (i) the ratio of our consolidated debt (net of our consolidated unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $5.0 million but not to exceed $250.0 million) to our consolidated net income (excluding, among other things, non-cash gains and losses) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash share-based compensation expense (“EBITDA”) on the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters (each, a “testing period”) to exceed 3.75 to 1.00 (or, at PFSA’s election and subject to certain conditions, 4.25 to 1.00 for four testing periods in connection with certain material acquisitions) (the “Leverage Ratio”) and (ii) the ratio of our EBITDA to our consolidated interest expense, for the same period to be less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. For purposes of the Leverage Ratio, the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility provide for the calculation of EBITDA giving pro forma effect to certain acquisitions, divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates. \nIn addition to the Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility, we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of $20.8 million, of which there were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2024. Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates.\nWe have $19.3 million of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months. We classified this debt as long-term as of December 31, 2024 as we have the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis under the revolving credit facility under the Senior Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $89.5 million of cash held in certain countries in which the ability to repatriate is limited due to local regulations or significant potential tax consequences.\n33\nAuthorized shares\nOur authorized share capital consists of 426.0 million ordinary shares with a par value of $0.01 per share. \nShare repurchases\nIn December 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of our ordinary shares up to a maximum dollar limit of $750.0 million. This authorization expires on December 31, 2025.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, no ordinary shares were repurchased. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 1.6 million of our ordinary shares for $150.0 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had $450.0 million available for share repurchases under this authorization. \nDividends\nOn December 16, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share that was paid on February 7, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 24, 2025. This dividend reflects a 9 percent increase in the Company’s regular cash dividend rate. The balance of dividends payable included in \nOther current liabilities\n on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $41.2 million at December 31, 2024. Dividends paid per ordinary share were $0.92, $0.88 and $0.84 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nUnder Irish law, the payment of future cash dividends and repurchases of shares may be paid only out of Pentair plc’s “distributable reserves” on its statutory balance sheet. Pentair plc is not permitted to pay dividends out of share capital, which includes share premiums. Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the Irish parent company and through a reduction in share capital approved by the Irish High Court. Distributable reserves are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g., retained earnings). Our distributable reserve balance was $6.8 billion and $6.9 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nSupplemental guarantor information\nPentair plc (the “Parent Company Guarantor”), fully and unconditionally, guarantees the senior notes of PFSA (the “Subsidiary Issuer”). The Subsidiary Issuer is a Luxembourg private limited liability company and 100 percent-owned subsidiary of the Parent Company Guarantor. \nThe Parent Company Guarantor is a holding company established to own directly and indirectly substantially all of its operating and other subsidiaries. The Subsidiary Issuer is a holding company formed to own directly and indirectly substantially all of its operating and other subsidiaries and to issue debt securities, including the senior notes. The Parent Company Guarantor’s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to make payments on the senior notes pursuant to the guarantees, is dividends from its subsidiaries. The Subsidiary Issuer’s principal source of cash flow is interest income from its subsidiaries. None of the subsidiaries of the Parent Company Guarantor or the Subsidiary Issuer is under any direct obligation to pay or otherwise fund amounts due on the senior notes or the guarantees, whether in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. In addition, there may be statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends from certain subsidiaries of the Parent Company Guarantor or the Subsidiary Issuer. If such subsidiaries are unable to transfer funds to the Parent Company Guarantor or the Subsidiary Issuer and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, the Parent Company Guarantor or the Subsidiary Issuer may not be able to make principal and interest payments on their outstanding debt, including the senior notes or the guarantees.\nThe following table presents summarized financial information as of December 31, 2024 for the Parent Company Guarantor and Subsidiary Issuer on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantors and issuer and (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-Guarantor or issuer.\nIn millions\nDecember 31,\n2024\nCurrent assets \n(1)\n$\n1.3 \nNoncurrent assets \n(2)\n2,551.7 \nCurrent liabilities \n(3)\n1,893.1 \nNoncurrent liabilities \n(4)\n1,828.6 \n(1)\n \n \nNo assets due from non-guarantor subsidiaries were included.\n(2) \n Includes assets due from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $2,547.3 million. \n(3) \n Includes liabilities due to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $1,843.0 million.\n(4)\n \n \nIncludes liabilities due to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $151.5 million.\nThe Parent Company Guarantor and Subsidiary Issuer do not have material results of operations on a combined basis.\n34\nMaterial Cash Requirements From Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe expect to continue to have sufficient cash and borrowing capacity to support working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly. We believe we have the ability to meet our short-term and long-term cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities. The following summarizes our material cash requirements from significant contractual obligations and purchase commitments that impact our liquidity as of December 31, 2024:\nIn millions\nNext Twelve Months\nGreater Than Twelve Months\nTotal\nDebt obligations (Note 8)\n$\n28.6 \n$\n1,634.5 \n$\n1,663.1 \nInterest obligations on fixed-rate debt\n42.5 \n237.2 \n279.7 \nOperating lease obligations, net of sublease rentals (Note 15)\n31.2 \n110.6 \n141.8 \nPension and other post-retirement plan benefit payments (Note 11)\n9.0 \n72.7 \n81.7 \nOther purchase obligations\n45.4 \n11.3 \n56.7 \nTotal contractual obligations, net\n$\n156.7 \n$\n2,066.3 \n$\n2,223.0 \nOther purchase obligations primarily include service and marketing contracts as well as commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business. For purposes of the above table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction.\nIn addition to the significant contractual obligations described above, we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2024, variable interest rate debt was $843.8 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.84%. Inclusive of our interest rate swaps and collars, our weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was 5.59% as of December 31, 2024. Refer to ITEM 8, Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our interest rate swaps and collars. \nThe total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2024 was estimated to be $6.0 million. We record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n and \nNet interest expense\n, respectively, which is consistent with our past practices. As of December 31, 2024, we had recorded $3.9 million related to the possible payment of interest and recorded no liabilities for the possible payment of penalties.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nWe have been, and in the future may be, made parties to a number of actions filed or have been, and in the future may be, given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business, including those relating to commercial, regulatory or contractual disputes with suppliers, authorities, customers or parties to acquisitions and divestitures, intellectual property matters, environmental, asbestos, safety and health matters, product liability, the use or installation of our products, consumer matters, and employment and labor matters.\nWhile we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation and applicable accounting rules. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements could change in the future.\nProduct liability claims\nWe are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald, our captive insurance subsidiary. See discussion in ITEM 1 and ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Insurance subsidiary. Penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. For all other claims, accruals covering the claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. We have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims.\n35\nStand-by letters of credit, bank guarantees and bonds\nIn certain situations, Tyco International Ltd., Pentair Ltd.’s former parent company (“Tyco”), guaranteed performance by the flow control business of Pentair Ltd. (“Flow Control”) to third parties or provided financial guarantees for financial commitments of Flow Control. In situations where Flow Control and Tyco were unable to obtain a release from these guarantees in connection with the spin-off of Flow Control from Tyco, we will indemnify Tyco for any losses it suffers as a result of such guarantees.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are required to commit to bonds, letters of credit and bank guarantees that require payments to our customers for any non-performance. The outstanding face value of these instruments fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under self-insurance programs.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the outstanding value of bonds, letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $102.1 million and $124.3 million, respectively.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K, for information pertaining to accounting standards recently adopted or to be adopted in the future.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWe have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n•\nit requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and\n•\nchanges in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected which would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur critical accounting estimates include the following:\nImpairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed.\nWe test our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We perform our annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the relevant reporting unit with its carrying amount. We would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. \nWe have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. However, we may elect to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist.\nDuring 2024, a qualitative assessment was performed. As a result, it was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. Factors considered in the analysis included the 2023 discounted cash flow fair value assessment of the reporting units and the calculated excess fair value over carrying amount, financial performance, forecasts and trends, market capitalization, regulatory and environmental issues, macro-economic conditions, industry and market considerations, raw material costs and management stability. We also consider the extent to which each of the adverse events and circumstances identified affect the comparison of the respective reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying amount. We place more weight on the events and circumstances that most affect the respective reporting unit’s \n36\nfair value or the carrying amount of its net assets. We consider positive and mitigating events and circumstances that may affect its determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying amount.\nDuring 2023, a quantitative assessment was performed. The fair value of each reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach. Projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses, projected capital expenditures, changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate. Use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publicly-traded companies that are similar in size and industry. For the 2023 annual impairment test, the estimated fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value in each of our reporting units, therefore, no impairment charge was required. The non-recurring fair value measurement is a “Level 3” measurement under the fair value hierarchy described in ITEM 8, Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIdentifiable intangible assets\nOur primary identifiable intangible assets include: customer relationships, trade names, proprietary technology and patents. Identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. No impairment charges associated with identifiable intangibles with finite lives were recognized in 2024 or 2023.\nIdentifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant. We complete our annual impairment test the first day of the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization. The impairment test for trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value. Fair value is measured using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. The non-recurring fair value measurement is a “Level 3” measurement under the fair value hierarchy. No impairment charges were recognized in 2024 or 2023 as a result of our annual impairment assessment.\nPension and other post-retirement plans\nWe sponsor U.S. and non-U.S. defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. The amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are assumptions, including: expected return on plan assets, discount rates, rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in ITEM 8, Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense. \nWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses for pension and other post-retirement benefits annually in the fourth quarter each year (“mark-to-market adjustment”) and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension and other post-retirement plans or when assumptions change as they may each year. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are (1) changes in the discount rate used to value pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and (2) differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets. This accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mark-to-market adjustments. Mark-to-market adjustments resulted in pre-tax gains of $5.3 million and $17.5 million in 2024 and 2022, respectively, and a pre-tax loss of $6.1 million in 2023. The remaining components of pension expense, including service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense.\nDiscount rates\nThe discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. The discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of bonds rated AA or higher available in the marketplace. There are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumptions that will impact our pension expense in 2025.\nExpected rate of return\nThe expected rate of return is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be subject to considerable year-to-year variance from actual returns. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, we considered our historical returns, with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader long-term market indices.\n37\nSensitivity to changes in key assumptions\nA 100 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rates used to measure our U.S. defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans would result in an approximate decrease of $5 million or increase of $6 million in our total projected benefit obligation. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on pension assets or discount rates for our U.S. pension and other post-retirement benefit plans would result in an immaterial change in our ongoing pension expense. These estimates exclude any potential mark-to-market adjustments.\nLoss contingencies\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.\nIncome taxes\nIn determining taxable income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\nWe currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.\nChanges in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment. Future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrue for uncertain tax positions. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards. As events change or resolution occurs, these liabilities are adjusted, such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n38",
