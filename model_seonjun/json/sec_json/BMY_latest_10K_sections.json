Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” filed on February 13, 2024.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. Refer to the Summary of Abbreviated Terms at the end of this 2024 Form 10-K for definitions of capitalized terms used throughout the document.\nIn 2024, we achieved multiple clinical and regulatory milestones across our portfolio including (i) approvals for \nBreyanzi\n in the U.S. and Japan for adults with relapsed or refractory FL and in the U.S. for adults with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL and MCL; (ii) \nReblozyl's\n expanded approval to include the first-line treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to very low, low and intermediate-risk MDS in the EU and Japan; (iii) FDA approval of \nOpdivo\n \nQvantig\n injection for subcutaneous use in most previously approved adult solid tumor \nOpdivo\n indications; (iv) FDA approval of \nOpdivo\n for the treatment of adult patients with resectable NSCLC, in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, followed by single-agent \nOpdivo\n as adjuvant treatment after surgery; and (v) FDA approval and subsequent launch of \nCobenfy\n for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.\nIn 2024, we completed the following acquisitions: (i) Karuna, a biopharmaceutical company in the area of developing and delivering medicines, including \nCobenfy,\n for psychiatric and neurological conditions; (ii) RayzeBio, a clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical therapeutics company with a pipeline of potentially first-in-class and/or best-in-class drug development programs; and (iii) Mirati, a commercial stage targeted oncology company, with a commercialized medicine, \nKrazati\n, and clinical programs in development. We also entered into a strategic collaboration with SystImmune, to co-develop and co-commercialize izalontamab brengitecan (iza-bren or BL-B01D1), a bispecific topoisomerase inhibitor-based anti-body drug conjugate. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements” for additional information.\nFinancial Highlights\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nDollars in millions, except per share data\n2024\n2023\nTotal Revenues\n$\n48,300 \n$\n45,006 \nDiluted (Loss)/Earnings Per Share\nGAAP\n$\n(4.41)\n$\n3.86 \nNon-GAAP\n1.15 \n7.51 \nRevenues increased by 7%, primarily driven by the Growth Portfolio and \nEliquis\n, partially offset by generic erosion in the Legacy Portfolio. We expect continued generic erosion within our Legacy Portfolio in 2025 primarily due to \nRevlimid\n, \nSprycel \nand\n \nfor \nPomalyst\n outside the U.S.\nThe $8.27 decrease in GAAP EPS in 2024 was primarily driven by a one-time, non-deductible Acquired IPRD charge resulting from the Karuna asset acquisition and SystImmune collaboration, which impacted full-year GAAP EPS by approximately $6.28 and the impact of certain specified items, primarily intangible asset impairments. After adjusting for specified items, the $6.36 decrease in non-GAAP EPS was primarily due to the aforementioned Acquired IPRD charges and higher interest expense partially offset by higher revenues.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude specified items that represent certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other items impacting the comparability of financial results. For a detailed listing of all specified items and further information, reconciliations and changes to our non-GAAP financial measures refer to “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n40\nEconomic and Market Factors\nGovernmental Actions\nAs regulators continue to focus on prescription drugs, our products are facing increased pressures across the portfolio. These pressures stem from legislative and policy changes, including price controls, pharmaceutical market access, discounting, changes to tax and importation laws and other restrictions in the U.S., EU and other regions around the world. These pressures have resulted in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and smaller populations for whom payers will reimburse, which can negatively impact our results of operations (including intangible asset impairment charges), operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. The IRA directs (i) the federal government to “negotiate” prices for select high-cost Medicare Part D (beginning in 2026) and Part B (beginning in 2028) drugs that are more than nine years (for small-molecule drugs) or 13 years (for biological products) from their initial FDA approval, (ii) manufacturers to pay a rebate for Medicare Part B and Part D drugs when prices increase faster than inflation and (iii) the formation of the Part D Manufacturer Program which replaced the Part D CGDP and established a $2,000 cap for out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries as of January 2025, with manufacturers being responsible for 10% of costs up to the $2,000 cap and 20% after that cap is reached. In August 2024, as part of the first round of government price setting pursuant to the IRA, the HHS announced the \"maximum fair price\" for a 30-day equivalent supply of \nEliquis\n, which applies to the U.S. Medicare channel effective January 1, 2026. In January 2025, the HHS selected \nPomalyst\n as a medicine subject to \"negotiation\" for government-set prices beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiry of intellectual property protections. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our results of operations, and it is possible that these changes may result in a material impact on our business and results of operations. \nIn addition, in December 2023, the Biden administration released a proposed framework that for the first time proposed that a drug’s price can be a factor in determining that the drug is not accessible to the public and, therefore, that the government could exercise “march-in rights” and license it to a third party to manufacture. We cannot predict whether the Trump administration will finalize the draft framework or if the government will propose other drug pricing policy changes. If pursued and finalized, these policies could reduce prices and reimbursement for certain of our products and could significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\nAt the state level, multiple states have passed, are pursuing or are considering government action via legislation or regulations to change drug pricing and reimbursement (e.g., establishing prescription drug affordability boards, implementing manufacturer mandates tied to the Federal Public Health Service Act drug pricing program, etc.). Some of these state-level actions may also influence federal and other state policies and legislation. Given the current uncertainty surrounding the adoption, timing and implementation of many of these measures, as well as pending litigation challenging such laws, we are unable to predict their full impact on our business. However, such measures could modify or decrease access, coverage, or reimbursement of our products, or result in significant changes to our sales or pricing practices, which could have a material impact on our revenues and results of operations. With respect to the Federal Public Health Service Act drug pricing program, certain states have enacted laws regulating manufacturer pricing obligations under the program to date. Several additional states are considering similar potential legislation or other government actions, and we expect other states may do the same in the future.\nAdditionally, in connection with the IRA, the following changes have been made to U.S. tax laws, including (i) a 15% minimum tax that generally applies to U.S. corporations on adjusted financial statement income beginning in 2023 and (ii) a non-deductible 1% excise tax provision on net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. Furthermore, countries are in the process of enacting changes to their tax laws to implement the agreement by the OECD to establish a global minimum tax. See risk factors on these items included under “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Product, Industry and Operational Risks—Increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the U.S. and abroad continue to negatively affect our revenues and profit margins”, “—We could lose market exclusivity of a product earlier than expected” and “—Changes to tax regulations could negatively impact our earnings.”\n41\nSignificant Product Approvals\nThe following is a summary of

principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a large pharmaceutical company with the speed, agility and focus on innovation typically found in the biotech industry. Our focus as a biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to make a meaningful difference: oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular, neuroscience and other areas where we can also create long-term value. Our priorities are to focus on transformational medicines where we have a competitive advantage, drive operational excellence throughout the organization and strategically allocate capital for long-term growth and returns.\nOur R&D strategy is intended to ensure that we support scientific innovation, bringing first-in class and/or best-in-class medicines to patients at an accelerated speed in our core therapeutic areas, as we leverage our differentiated research platforms, including radiopharmaceutical therapy, targeted protein degradation and cell therapy. We have a broad mid- to late-stage pipeline of ongoing Phase II and Phase III programs across our core therapeutic areas. Over the next 24 months, we expect a number of registrational data readouts with the potential to deliver 10 or more new medicines and multiple additional indications over the next five years.\nIn oncology, we are focused on extending and strengthening our leadership in IO, as well as diversifying beyond IO. The acquisition of RayzeBio, a leader in the field of radiopharmaceuticals for solid tumor oncology, provided us with RYZ101, a late-stage asset, an investigational new drug engine and in-house manufacturing capabilities. In hematology, we see significant potential with our targeted protein degradation platform, which includes potentially first-in-class CELMoDs currently under investigation for multiple myeloma with iberdomide and mezigdomide and lymphoma with golcadomide. In cell therapy, we are building on our expertise and leadership, developing next generation CAR-T treatments with first-in-class potential. We are investigating arlo-cel in pivotal studies targeting multiple myeloma and advancing development for CD19-targeted NEX-T, an optimized asset aimed at resetting the immune system, in autoimmune diseases. We are exploring CD19-targeted NEX-T's potential in multiple disease areas, including systemic lupus erythematosus, MS, and other indications. Additionally, in immunology, we are developing admilparant, our LPA1 antagonist targeting pulmonary fibrosis with ongoing registrational clinical trials for IPF and PPF. In cardiovascular diseases, the LIBREXIA clinical program, in partnership with Johnson & Johnson, includes three Phase III registrational trials for milvexian in atrial fibrillation, secondary stroke prevention and acute coronary syndrome. Lastly in neuroscience, with the addition of \nCobenfy\n, we have a growing, diverse neuroscience pipeline that includes a range of investigational therapies that are being studied for their disease-modifying potential as well as critical symptomatic relief. Together with our proven track record, rapidly advancing pipeline and increasing use of artificial intelligence, we are increasing our R&D productivity, enabling us to identify more high-quality candidates and increase their probability of reaching patients in need.\nWe are driving commercial execution in our key first-in-class and/or best-in-class marketed products, where we continue to expand and see potential for further expansion into the future. We have established a foundation in IO with \nOpdivo\n, \nYervoy\n and \nOpdualag\n and received FDA approval for \nOpdivo Qvantig\n in December 2024 for multiple indications at launch. \nReblozyl, \nin first-line MDS-associated anemia, continues to drive market share within the larger first-line RS negative population. We have an ongoing registrational trial to potentially expand into chronic anemia associated with myelofibrosis. In cell therapy, we achieved important approvals for \nBreyanzi\n for patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL, FL and MCL, making \nBreyanzi\n the CAR-T cell therapy available to treat the broadest array of B-cell malignancies. In cardiovascular diseases, \nCamzyos\n continues to provide benefits to patients with oHCM, with the potential expansion opportunity into nHCM. Finally, in neuroscience, we launched \nCobenfy\n for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Registrational studies are ongoing or planned for \nCobenfy\n in Adjunctive Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's Disease Psychosis, Alzheimer's Disease Agitation, Alzheimer's Disease Cognition, Bipolar I Disorder and Autism spectrum disorder irritability.\nWe remain committed to the strategic allocation of resources and investing in areas that maximize value and drive sustainable growth. We previously announced a strategic productivity initiative to accelerate the delivery of medicines to patients by evolving and streamlining our enterprise operating model in key areas such as R&D, manufacturing, commercial and other functions. We expected to realize cost savings of approximately $1.5 billion by the end of 2025, which is primarily being reinvested to fund innovation and drive growth. We have expanded our strategic productivity initiative and we now expect to deliver approximately $2.0 billion in additional annual cost savings by the end of 2027. The exit costs resulting from these actions are included in our updated 2023 Restructuring Plan.\nOur strategy extends well beyond the discovery, development and delivery of transformative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. We understand the future of our employees, our communities, our planet, and our business are inextricably linked. Through our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy, we seek to mobilize our capabilities and resources to positively impact the communities where we live, work, and serve around the world. As we work to transform patients’ lives through science, we operate with effective governance, uncompromising quality and compliance, and the highest ethical standards to deliver our mission. These values have been central to who we are, what we do, and how we do it since our company was founded in 1887. We believe that driving long-term business value is at the heart of living our purpose, enabling us to be leaders and difference-makers for generations to come. \n44\nAcquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements\nFor detailed information on significant acquisitions, divestitures, collaborations, licensing and other arrangements during 2024 refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data —Note 3. Alliances” and “—Note 4. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements.”\n45\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRegional Revenues\nThe composition of the changes in revenues was as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nDollars in millions\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n Foreign Exchange\n(c)\nUnited States\n$\n34,105 \n$\n31,210 \n9 \n%\n— \nInternational\n(a)\n13,199 \n13,097 \n1 \n%\n(5)\n%\nOther revenues\n(b)\n996 \n699 \n42 \n%\nN/A\nTotal Revenues\n$\n48,300 \n$\n45,006 \n7 \n%\n(2)\n%\n(a)    Beginning in 2024, Puerto Rico revenues are presented as part of International revenues to align with management's review of the Company's financial results. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current presentation. \n(b)    Other revenues include royalties and alliance-related revenues for products not sold by our regional commercial organizations.\n(c)    Foreign exchange impacts were derived by applying the prior period average currency rates to the current period revenues.\nUnited States\n•\nU.S. revenues increased 9% in 2024 primarily due to higher demand within the Growth Portfolio, \nEliquis\n, and \nPomalyst\n partially offset by generic erosion in the Legacy Portfolio. Average net selling prices decreased by 1% in 2024 compared to 2023.\nInternational\n•\nInternational revenues in 2024 increased 1% primarily due to demand within the Growth Portfolio, partially offset by generic erosion within the Legacy Portfolio and foreign exchange impacts. The negative foreign exchange impacts of 5% was primarily attributed to devaluation of the Argentine peso, which was partially offset by inflation-related local currency price increases.\nNo single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of total revenues in 2024 and 2023. Our business is typically not seasonal; however, in the first quarter we typically see an unwinding of sales channel inventory build-up from the fourth quarter of the prior year.\nGTN Adjustments\nWe recognize revenue net of GTN adjustments that are further described in “—Critical Accounting Policies.”\nThe activities and ending reserve balances for each significant category of GTN adjustments were as follows:\nDollars in millions\nCharge-Backs and Cash Discounts\nMedicaid and Medicare Rebates\nOther Rebates, Returns, Discounts and Adjustments\nTotal\nBalance at January 1, 2024\n$\n646 \n$\n4,445 \n$\n3,237 \n$\n8,328 \nProvision related to sales made in:\nCurrent period\n11,518 \n16,642 \n8,892 \n37,052 \nPrior period\n(8)\n(91)\n(60)\n(159)\nPayments and returns \n(11,254)\n(15,612)\n(8,287)\n(35,153)\nForeign currency translation and other\n(2)\n1 \n(146)\n(147)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n900 \n$\n5,385 \n$\n3,636 \n$\n9,921 \n46\nThe reconciliation of gross product sales to net product sales by each significant category of GTN adjustments was as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nDollars in millions\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nGross product sales\n$\n83,671 \n$\n73,679 \n14 \n%\nGTN Adjustments\nCharge-backs and cash discounts\n(11,510)\n(9,144)\n26 \n%\nMedicaid and Medicare rebates\n(16,551)\n(13,411)\n23 \n%\nOther rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments\n(8,832)\n(7,346)\n20 \n%\nTotal GTN Adjustments\n(36,893)\n(29,901)\n23 \n%\nNet product sales\n$\n46,778 \n$\n43,778 \n7 \n%\nGTN adjustments percentage\n44 \n%\n40 \n%\n4 \n%\nU.S.\n49 \n%\n46 \n%\n3 \n%\nNon-U.S.\n20 \n%\n19 \n%\n1 \n%\nReductions to provisions for product sales made in prior periods resulting from changes in estimates were $159 million for 2024 and $134 million for 2023. The reductions to provisions in both years were driven by the non-U.S. revisions in clawback amounts driven by VAT recoverable estimates. GTN adjustments are primarily a function of product sales volume, regional and payer channel mix, contractual or legislative discounts and rebates. U.S. GTN adjustments percentage increased primarily due to higher government channel mix, which has higher GTN adjustment percentages. Non-U.S. GTN adjustments percentage increased primarily due to continued pricing pressures.

We disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to certain limited exceptions. There were none as of December 31, 2024, for our U.S. distribution channels, and September 30, 2024, for our non-U.S. distribution channels.\nIn the U.S., we generally determine our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 85% of total gross sales of U.S. products for the year ended December 31, 2024. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic erosion, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes. \nCamzyos\n is only available through a restricted program called the \nCamzyos\n REMS Program. Product distribution is limited to REMS certified pharmacies, and enrolled pharmacies must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive \nCamzyos\n. \nRevlimid\n \nand \nPomalyst\n are distributed in the U.S. primarily through contracted pharmacies under the Lenalidomide REMS and \nPomalyst\n REMS programs, respectively. These are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of \nRevlimid\n \nand \nPomalyst\n.\n \nInternationally, \nRevlimid\n \nand \nImnovid\n are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities’ specifications to provide for the products’ safe and appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.\nOur non-U.S. businesses have significantly more direct customers. Information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. We limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. When this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2024 is not available prior to the filing of this 2024 Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand for the current quarter, subject to certain limited exceptions, in our next quarterly report on Form 10-Q.\n54\nExpenses\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nDollar in Millions\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nCost of products sold \n(a)\n$\n13,968 \n$\n10,693 \n31 \n%\nMarketing, selling and administrative\n8,414 \n7,772 \n8 \n%\nResearch and development\n11,159 \n9,299 \n20 \n%\nAcquired IPRD \n13,373 \n913 \n>200%\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n8,872 \n9,047 \n(2)\n%\nOther (income)/expense, net\n893 \n(1,158)\n(177)\n%\nTotal Expenses\n$\n56,679 \n$\n36,566 \n55 \n%\n(a)    Excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nCost of products sold\nCost of products sold include material, internal labor and overhead costs from our owned manufacturing sites, third-party product supply costs and other supply chain costs managed by our global manufacturing and supply organization.

Excluding the impact of specified items, the effective tax rate was impacted by the aforementioned Karuna non-tax deductible charge and jurisdictional earnings mix.\nThe effective tax rate for 2023 was primarily impacted by (i) a $656 million deferred income tax benefit following the receipt of a non-U.S. tax ruling regarding the deductibility of a statutory impairment of subsidiary investments, (ii) higher tax benefits attributed to foreign currency on net operating loss and other carryforwards, and (iii) a $193 million valuation allowance reversal related to unrealized equity investment losses. Excluding the impact of specified items, the effective tax rate was impacted by revised guidance regarding deductibility of certain research and development expenses which reduced income taxes attributable to 2023 pre-tax income by approximately $160 million and was the primary reason for a $240 million reduction to previously estimated income taxes for 2022 upon finalization of the U.S. Federal income tax return.\nRefer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7. Income Taxes” for additional information.\nIn December 2022, the EU member states unanimously voted to adopt a Directive implementing the Pillar Two (global minimum tax) rules giving member states until December 31, 2023 to implement the Directive into national legislation. Certain jurisdictions in which we operate, under the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework, have enacted legislation that adopts a subset of such rules effective January 1, 2024, with the remaining rules becoming effective January 1, 2025. These rules and associated legislative changes may significantly impact our tax provision and results of operations. \n57\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. These items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results. These items are excluded from non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information because the Company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods, including (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, (ii) unwinding of inventory purchase price adjustments, (iii) acquisition and integration expenses, (iv) restructuring costs, (v) accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, (vi) costs of acquiring a priority review voucher, (vii) divestiture gains or losses, (viii) stock compensation resulting from acquisition-related equity awards, (ix) pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, (x) equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments (including fair value adjustments attributed to limited partnership equity method investments), (xi) income resulting from the change in control of the Nimbus TYK2 Program and (xii) amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from Celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. Certain other significant tax items are also excluded such as the impact resulting from a non-U.S. tax ruling regarding the deductibility of a statutory impairment of subsidiary investments and release of income tax reserves relating to the Celgene acquisition. We also provide international revenues for our priority products excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We calculate foreign exchange impacts by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior period average currency rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in Exhibit 99.1 to our Form 8-K filed on February 6, 2025 and are incorporated herein by reference.\nNon-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and investors’ overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n58\nSpecified items were as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nDollars in millions\n2024\n2023\nInventory purchase price accounting adjustments\n$\n47 \n$\n84 \nIntangible asset impairment \n1,839 \n27 \nSite exit and other costs\n133 \n64 \nCost of products sold\n2,019 \n175 \nAcquisition related charges\n(a)\n372 \n— \nSite exit and other costs\n50 \n94 \nMarketing, selling and administrative\n422 \n94 \nIPRD impairments\n980 \n80 \nPriority review voucher\n— \n95 \nAcquisition related charges\n(a)\n348 \n— \nSite exit and other costs\n49 \n12 \nResearch and development\n1,377 \n187 \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n8,872 \n9,047 \nInterest expense\n(b)\n(49)\n(52)\nLitigation and other settlements\n61 \n(397)\nProvision for restructuring\n635 \n365 \nIntegration expenses\n284 \n242 \nEquity investment (gains)/losses\n(18)\n152 \nDivestiture losses\n15 \n— \nOther\n217\n55\nOther (income)/expense, net\n1,145 \n365 \nIncrease to pretax income\n13,835 \n9,868 \nIncome taxes on items above\n(2,045)\n(1,639)\nIncome tax reserve releases\n(502)\n— \nIncome taxes attributed to non-U.S. tax ruling \n— \n(656)\nIncome taxes\n(2,547)\n(2,295)\nIncrease to net earnings\n$\n11,288 \n$\n7,573 \n(a) Includes cash settlement of unvested stock awards, and other related costs incurred in connection with the recent acquisitions.\n(b) Includes amortization of purchase price adjustments to Celgene debt.\n59\nThe reconciliations from GAAP to Non-GAAP were as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nDollars in millions, except per share data\n2024\n2023\nNet (loss)/earnings attributable to BMS \nGAAP\n$\n(8,948)\n$\n8,025 \nSpecified Items\n11,288 \n7,573 \nNon-GAAP\n$\n2,340 \n$\n15,598 \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding – diluted – GAAP\n2,027 \n2,078 \nIncremental shares attributable to share-based compensation plans\n5 \n— \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding – diluted – Non-GAAP\n2,032 \n2,078 \nDiluted (loss)/earnings per share attributable to BMS\nGAAP\n$\n(4.41)\n$\n3.86 \nSpecified items\n5.56 \n3.65 \nNon-GAAP\n$\n1.15 \n$\n7.51 \n60\nFinancial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur net debt position was as follows:\nDecember 31,\nDollars in millions\n2024\n2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n10,346 \n$\n11,464 \nMarketable debt securities – current\n513 \n816 \nMarketable debt securities – non-current\n320 \n364 \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities\n11,179 \n12,644 \nShort-term debt obligations\n(2,046)\n(3,119)\nLong-term debt\n(47,603)\n(36,653)\nNet debt position\n$\n(38,470)\n$\n(27,128)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe regularly assess our anticipated working capital needs, debt and leverage ratio levels, debt maturities, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions in order to maximize shareholder return, efficiently finance our ongoing operations and maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions. We also regularly evaluate our capital structure to ensure financial risks, adequate liquidity access and lower cost of capital are efficiently managed, which may lead to the issuance of additional debt securities, the repurchase of debt securities prior to maturity or the issuance or repurchase of common stock. \nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities together with cash generated from operations in the next few years, and, if required, from the issuance of commercial paper, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next few years, including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital, income taxes, restructuring initiatives, repurchase of common stock, and debt maturities of approximately $14.0 billion through 2029, as well as any debt repurchases through redemptions or tender offers. \nIn 2024, we issued the 2024 Senior Unsecured Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $13.0 billion with proceeds, net of discount and loan issuance costs, of $12.9 billion. The proceeds from the 2024 Senior Unsecured Notes were used to partially fund the acquisitions of RayzeBio and Karuna, and the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In connection with the issuance of the 2024 Senior Unsecured Notes, we terminated the $10.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility entered in February 2024 to provide bridge financing for the RayzeBio and Karuna acquisitions. For more information on planned acquisitions, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements” and refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data —Note 10. Financing Arrangements” for further information.\nWe have a share repurchase program, authorized by our Board of Directors, allowing for repurchases of BMS common stock shares, effected in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares nor does it have a specific expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In 2023, we repurchased approximately 87 million shares of our common stock for $5.2 billion, including approximately 70 million shares for $4.0 billion through our ASR agreements. In December 2023, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $3.0 billion to the share repurchase authorization for BMS's common stock. The remaining share repurchase capacity under the BMS share repurchase program was $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2024. There were no share repurchases in 2024. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 17. Equity” for additional information.\nDividend payments were $4.9 billion in 2024 and $4.7 billion in 2023. Dividend paid per common share was $0.60 during each quarter of 2024. Dividends are authorized on a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a five-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in January 2029, which is extendable annually by one year with the consent of the lenders. In January 2025, we extended the credit facility to January 2030. Additionally, in February 2024, we entered into a $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility which expired in January 2025. The facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants and may be used to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings. No borrowings were outstanding under any revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n61\nAs of December 31, 2024, under our commercial paper program, we could issue up to $7.0 billion of unsecured notes, with maturities of not more than 365 days from the date of issuance. Of this amount, $3.0 billion was issued and repaid during 2024. In January 2025, the maximum amount of commercial paper that could be issued was reduced to $5.0 billion following the expiration of the aforementioned $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility.\nOur investment portfolio includes marketable debt securities, which are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. Our investment policy establishes limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. The policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10. Financing Arrangements” for further information.\nCapital Expenditures\nAnnual capital expenditures were approximately $1.2 billion in 2024, $1.1 billion in 2023 and 2022 and are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2025. We continue to make capital expenditures in connection with the expansion of our cell therapy and other manufacturing capabilities, research and development and other facility-related activities.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations relating to debt, income taxes and lease arrangements are provided in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1. Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards”, “—Note 10. Financing Arrangements”, “—Note 7. Income Taxes” and “—Note 14. Leases”, respectively.\nWe are committed to an aggregate $17.2 billion of potential contingent future research and development milestone payments to third parties for in-licensing, asset acquisitions and development programs including early-stage milestones of $5.8 billion (milestones achieved through Phase III clinical studies) and late-stage milestones of $11.4 billion (milestones achieved post Phase III clinical studies). Payments generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. Certain agreements also provide for sales-based milestones aggregating to $16.2 billion that we would be obligated to pay upon achievement of certain sales levels in addition to royalties. We also have certain manufacturing, development and commercialization obligations in connection with alliance arrangements. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of these obligations. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 3. Alliances” and \"—Note 4. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements\" for further information.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our financial condition or results of operations.\nCredit Ratings\nOur current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s Investors Service are A2 and Prime-1, respectively, with a stable long-term credit outlook. Our current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poor’s are A and A-1, respectively, with a stable long-term credit outlook. The long-term ratings reflect the agencies’ opinion that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. The short-term ratings reflect the agencies’ opinion that we have good to extremely strong capacity for timely repayment. Any credit rating downgrade may affect the interest rate of any debt we may incur, the fair market value of existing debt and our ability to access the capital markets generally.\nCash Flows\nThe following is a discussion of cash flow activities:\nYear Ended December 31,\nDollars in millions\n2024\n2023\nCash flow provided by/(used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n15,190 \n$\n13,860 \nInvesting activities\n(21,352)\n(2,295)\nFinancing activities\n5,127 \n(9,416)\n62\nOperating Activities\nCash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. As a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business.\nThe $1.3 billion increase in cash flow provided by operating activities compared to 2023, was primarily due to higher customer collections, net of rebates, discounts, and alliance payments ($3.4 billion) and lower income tax payments ($450 million), partially offset by higher acquisition-related payments, including cash settlement of unvested stock awards ($1.0 billion), and higher interest expense payments on debt ($600 million), as well as timing of payments in the ordinary course of business.\nInvesting Activities\nCash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities with original maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase, proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties), the sale and maturity of marketable securities, sale of equity investments, as well as upfront and contingent milestones payments from licensing arrangements.\nThe $19.1 billion increase in cash flow used in investing activities compared to 2023 was due to payments for the Mirati, RayzeBio and Karuna acquisitions and SystImmune collaboration of $20.7 billion, partially offset by changes in the amount of marketable debt securities held of $1.4 billion.\nFinancing Activities\nCash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings.\nThe $14.5 billion change in cash provided by financing activities compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher net borrowings of $9.6 billion used primarily to fund our acquisitions and share repurchases of $5.2 billion in 2023.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor recently issued accounting standards, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1. Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards.”\nSEC Consent Order\nAs previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004.\nUnder the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. We also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.\nWe have established a company-wide policy concerning our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent, which includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.\n63\nWe maintain DSAs with our U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers and specialty distributors, which account for approximately 89% of our gross U.S. revenues. Under the current terms of the DSAs, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. The three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 85% of our gross U.S. revenues. The inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. We estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our U.S. business’s wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. In contrast, our non-U.S. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units.\nWe believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our critical accounting policies are those that significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. Revenue is recognized following a five-step model: (i) identify the customer contract; (ii) identify the contract’s performance obligation; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation; and (v) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue is also reduced for GTN sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. Estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revise information or actual experience.\nThe following categories of GTN adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2. Revenue” for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of GTN sales adjustments.\nCharge-backs and cash discounts\nOur U.S. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340B program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge-back claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag).\nIn the U.S. and some other countries, customers are offered cash discounts as an incentive for prompt payment on certain products, approximating 2% of the invoiced sales price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of cash discount at the time of sale and the discount is typically taken by the customer within one month.\nMedicaid and Medicare rebates\nOur U.S. business participates in state government Medicaid programs and other qualifying Federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates to participating state and local government entities. All discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our Medicaid rebate accrual. Medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed Medicaid plans. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability.\nRebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. managing prescription drug programs and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Through December 31, 2024, we paid a 70% point of service discount to CMS when the Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the coverage gap. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.\n64\nOther rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments\nOther GTN sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-U.S. countries as well as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. to a lesser extent. The non-U.S. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.\nEstimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the loss of market exclusivity. Estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand. The estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.\nUse of information from external sources\nInformation from external sources is used to estimate GTN adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers is based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.\nWe have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. Our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.\nAcquisition and Intangible Assets Valuations\nWe make certain judgments to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or as business combinations. If it is determined that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the transaction is treated as an acquisition of assets. We evaluate the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities and assets. If the assets in a transaction include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the transaction is treated as an acquisition of a business.\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Estimating fair value requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions. \nIn transactions accounted for as acquisitions of assets, no goodwill is recorded and contingent consideration, such as payments upon achievement of various developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, generally is not recognized at the acquisition date. In an asset acquisition, upfront payments allocated to IPRD projects at the acquisition date are expensed unless there is an alternative future use. In addition, product development milestones are expensed upon achievement.\nWe have identifiable intangible assets that are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Generally, we engage an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. The fair value of these assets is estimated using discounted cash flow models. These models required the use of the following significant estimates and assumptions among others:\n65\n•\nIdentification of product candidates with sufficient substance requiring separate recognition;\n•\nEstimates of revenues and operating profits related to commercial products or product candidates;\n•\nEligible patients, pricing and market share used in estimating future revenues;\n•\nProbability of success for unapproved product candidates and additional indications for commercial products;\n•\nResources required to complete the development and approval of product candidates;\n•\nTiming of regulatory approvals and exclusivity;\n•\nAppropriate discount rate by products;\n•\nMarket participant income tax rates; and\n•\nAllocation of expected synergies to products.\nWe believe the fair value used to record intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions considering the facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date.\nImpairment and Amortization of Long-lived Assets, including Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets include intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable or at least annually for Goodwill and IPRD. Intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or IPRD. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include changes in competitive landscape, earlier than expected loss of market exclusivity, pricing reductions, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval for initial or follow on indications and unanticipated development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. If the carrying value of long-lived assets exceeds its fair value, then the asset is written-down to its fair value. Expectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. The estimated useful lives of long-lived assets are subjective and require significant judgment regarding patent lives, future plans and external market factors. Long-lived assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of depreciation or amortization. Impairment charges included in Cost of products sold, Research and development, and Other (income)/expense, net were $2.9 billion in 2024, $136 million in 2023 and $101 million in 2022. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for further discussion and analysis of these impairment charges.\nIncome Taxes\nValuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Our deferred tax assets were $8.4 billion at December 31, 2024 (net of valuation allowance of $929 million) and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2023 (net of valuation allowance of $764 million).\nThe U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards were $2.0 billion at December 31, 2024. These carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
