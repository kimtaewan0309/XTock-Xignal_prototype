REITs will generally not be liable for U.S. federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less than 100% of their REIT taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P. is our majority-owned Indiana partnership subsidiary that owns directly or indirectly all of our real estate properties and other assets.  According to the amended and restated Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is required to pay all expenses of Simon. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Simon” mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the “Operating Partnership” mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to “we,” “us” and “our” mean collectively Simon, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon and/or the Operating Partnership. \nWe own, develop and manage premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets\n®\n, and The Mills\n®\n. As of September 30, 2025, we owned or held an interest in 194 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 92 malls, 70 Premium Outlets, 14 Mills, six lifestyle centers, and 12 other retail properties in 37 states and Puerto Rico. We also own an 88% noncontrolling interest in the Taubman Realty Group, LLC, or TRG, which has an interest in 22 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the U.S. and Asia. In addition, we have redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants, underway at properties in North America. Internationally, as of September 30, 2025, we had ownership in 38 Premium Outlets, Designer Outlets, and Luxury Outlet properties primarily located in Asia, Europe, and Canada. As of September 30, 2025, we also owned a 22.4% equity stake in Klépierre SA, or Klépierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 14 countries in Europe.  We also have interests in investments in retail operations (such as Catalyst Brands LLC, or Catalyst); an e-commerce venture (Rue Gilt Groupe, or RGG, which operates shop.simon.com), and Jamestown (a global real estate investment and management company), collectively, our other platform investments. \nWe generate the majority of our lease income from retail, dining, entertainment, and other tenants including consideration received from:\n●\nfixed minimum lease consideration and fixed common area maintenance (CAM) reimbursements, and\n●\nvariable lease consideration primarily based on tenants’ reported sales, as well as reimbursements for real estate taxes, utilities, marketing and certain other items.\nRevenues of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.\nWe invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. We seek to accomplish this growth through the following:\n●\nattracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses,\n●\nexpanding and re-tenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates,\n●\nselectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets,\n●\ngenerating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances, including creating mixed-use destinations, and\n●\nselling selective non-core assets.\nWe also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities:\n●\nestablishing our properties as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused corporate alliances, including national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business development, sponsorship, and events,\n●\noffering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the provision of energy services,\n●\nselling or leasing land adjacent to our properties, commonly referred to as “outlots” or “outparcels,” and\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\ngenerating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related entities.\nWe focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. We expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward criteria. We selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties.\nWe routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.\nTo support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:\n●\ngenerate the capital necessary to fund growth,\n●\nmaintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, including but not limited to, having in place the Operating Partnership’s $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, its $3.5 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Supplemental Facility, and together, the Credit Facilities, and its global unsecured commercial paper note program, or the Commercial Paper program, of $2.0 billion, or the non-U.S. dollar equivalent thereof, and\n●\nmanage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.\nWe consider FFO, Real Estate FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and portfolio NOI to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included below in this discussion.\nResults Overview\nDiluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit decreased $0.39 during the first nine months of 2025 to $4.83 from $5.22 for the same period last year. The decrease in diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit was primarily attributable to: \n●\na pre-tax gain during the first quarter of 2024 on the sale of all our remaining interests in Authentic Brands Group, or ABG, of $414.8 million, or $1.11 per diluted share/unit,\n●\nincreased depreciation and amortization in 2025 of $68.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to our acquisition and development activity, \n●\ndecreased other income of $62.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to decreased interest income of $46.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share/unit, and lower distributions and other activity of $15.9 million, or $0.05 per diluted share/unit, \n●\nan unrealized, unfavorable change in fair value of publicly traded equity instruments and bifurcated derivative, net, of $30.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share/unit, which primarily relates to movements in the fair value of the exchange option within our exchangeable bonds,\n●\nincreased real estate tax expenses of $28.3 million, or $0.08 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to the consolidation of three properties and successful property tax appeals in 2024,\n●\nincreased property operating expenses in 2025 of $27.9 million, or $0.07 per diluted share/unit,\n●\nincreased interest expense of $24.1 million, or $0.06 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to new draws on the Credit Facilities and a Euro term loan issuance subsequent to the third quarter of 2024, and \n●\nincreased home and regional office expenses of $22.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to increased personnel and compensation costs, partially offset by,\n●\nimproved operating performance and solid core business fundamentals in 2025, as discussed below, \n●\nincreased lease income of $241.6 million, or $0.64 per diluted share/unit,\n●\nincreased income from unconsolidated entities of $230.8 million, or $0.61 per diluted share/unit, the majority of which is due to improved year-over-year operations from other platform investments and improved operations and core fundamentals in our other unconsolidated entities, and\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\na net pre-tax gain in 2025 due to disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests of $71.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share/unit, due to certain merger-related activities within Catalyst, primarily because of the deconsolidation of Forever 21.\nPortfolio NOI increased 4.5% for the nine month period in 2025 over the prior year period primarily as a result of improved operations in our domestic and international portfolios compared to the prior year. Average base minimum rent for U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets increased 2.5% to $59.14 psf as of September 30, 2025, from $57.71 psf as of September 30, 2024.  Ending occupancy for our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets increased 0.2% to 96.4% as of September 30, 2025, from 96.2% as of September 30, 2024.\nOur effective overall borrowing rate at September 30, 2025 on our consolidated indebtedness increased 12 basis points to 3.73% as compared to 3.61% at September 30, 2024. This is primarily due to an increase in the effective overall borrowing rate on the fixed rate debt of 15 basis points, due to increasing benchmark rates, partially offset by an increase in the amount of variable rate debt. The weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 7.6 years and 8.1 years at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nOur financing activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 included:\n●\nOn August 19, 2025, the Operating Partnership completed the issuance of $700 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.375% and a maturity date of October 1, 2030, and $800 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 5.125% and a maturity date of October 1, 2035. A portion of the proceeds were used to redeem, at par, its $1.1 billion 3.50% senior unsecured notes at maturity on September 1, 2025. Another portion of the proceeds were used to repay the €500 million outstanding under the Supplemental Facility on October 8, 2025.\n●\non May 12, 2025, the Operating Partnership drew €500 million under the Supplemental Facility, and proceeds were used to fund the redemption at par of the Operating Partnerships €500.0 million notes maturing on May 13, 2025,\n●\non April 25, 2025, the Operating Partnership drew $155 million under the Credit Facility, \n●\non March 20, 2025, the Operating Partnership entered into a €350 million unsecured term loan with a maturity date of March 20, 2027, and swapped the interest rate to an all-in fixed rate of 2.5965% maturing on March 20, 2026. The proceeds of the term loan, along with cash on hand, were used to repay the then remaining €376.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility, \n●\non March 13, 2025, the Operating Partnership repaid €18 million under the Credit Facility that had been outstanding on December 31, 2024,\n●\non January 29, 2025, the Operating Partnership drew €376 million under the Credit Facility, and used the proceeds to facilitate the acquisition of two Italian assets.\nUnited States Portfolio Data\nThe portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics: ending occupancy and average base minimum rent per square foot. We include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition. For comparative information purposes, we separate the information related to The Mills and TRG from our other U.S. operations. We also do not include any information for properties located outside the United States.\nThe following table sets forth these key operating statistics for domestic properties:\n●\nproperties that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements,\n●\nproperties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures, and\n●\nthe foregoing two categories of properties on a total portfolio basis.\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nSeptember 30, \n    \nSeptember 30, \n    \n%/Basis Points\n​\n​\n2025\n​\n2024\n​\nChange (1)\nU.S. Malls and Premium Outlets:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nEnding Occupancy\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nConsolidated\n \n​\n96.4%\n​\n​\n96.2%\n​\n20 bps\nUnconsolidated\n \n​\n96.1%\n​\n​\n96.2%\n​\n-10 bps\nTotal Portfolio\n \n​\n96.4%\n​\n​\n96.2%\n​\n20 bps\nAverage Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nConsolidated\n​\n$\n 57.41\n​\n$\n 56.18\n​\n2.2%\nUnconsolidated\n​\n$\n 64.39\n​\n$\n 62.04\n​\n3.8%\nTotal Portfolio\n​\n$\n 59.14\n​\n$\n 57.71\n​\n2.5%\nU.S. TRG:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nEnding Occupancy\n​\n \n94.2%\n​\n \n94.2%\n​\n0 bps\nAverage Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot\n​\n$\n 72.36\n​\n$\n 66.74\n​\n8.4%\nThe Mills:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nEnding Occupancy\n​\n \n99.4%\n​\n \n98.6%\n​\n80 bps\nAverage Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot\n​\n$\n 38.25\n​\n$\n 37.56\n​\n1.8%\n(1)\nPercentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Percentage and basis point changes are representative of the change from the comparable prior period.\nEnding Occupancy Levels and Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot.\n  Ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area, or GLA, which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all company owned space except for mall anchors, mall majors, mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation. Base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy. \nCurrent Leasing Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we signed 819 new leases and 1,383 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio, comprising approximately 8.3 million square feet, of which 6.4 million square feet related to consolidated properties. During the comparable period in 2024, we signed 877 new leases and 1,750 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent, comprising approximately 9.3 million square feet, of which 7.2 million square feet related to consolidated properties. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $65.09 per square foot in 2025 and $65.45 per square foot in 2024 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of $60.13 per square foot and $55.73 per square foot, respectively.  \nJapan Data\nThe following are selected key operating statistics for our Premium Outlets in Japan.

We own 100% of this center.\n●\nOn February 6, 2024, we acquired an additional interest in Miami International Mall from a joint venture partner, resulting in the consolidation of this property.\nThe following acquisitions, dispositions and openings of equity method investments and properties affected our income from unconsolidated entities in the comparative periods:\n●\nOn March 6, 2025, we opened Jakarta Premium Outlets, a 302,000 square foot center in Indonesia. We own a 50% interest in this center.\n●\nOn December 19, 2024, J.C. Penney acquired the retail operations of SPARC Group and was renamed Catalyst Brands post transaction. As a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain of $100.5 million. After the transaction, we own a 31.3% noncontrolling interest in Catalyst. Additionally, we continue to hold a 33.3% noncontrolling interest in SPARC Holdings, the former owner of SPARC Group, which now primarily holds a 25% interest in Catalyst.\n●\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we acquired additional 4% ownership in TRG for approximately $266.7 million by issuing 1,572,500 units in the Operating Partnership, bringing our noncontrolling interest in TRG to 88%.\n●\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we disposed all of our remaining interest in ABG.  \n​\nThree months ended September 30, 2025 vs. Three months ended \nSeptember 30, 2024\nLease income increased $113.1 million, due to an increase in fixed lease income of $80.5 million primarily due to an increase in fixed minimum lease consideration and higher occupancy, an increase in variable lease income of $32.6 million and the acquisition and development activity noted above.  \nTotal other income increased $4.3 million, primarily due to $18.7 million in 2025 land sale activity and a $3.2 million increase in distribution and other income sources, partially offset by a $15.3 million decrease in interest income and a $2.3 million decrease in franchise operations income.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $18.3 million primarily due to our acquisition and development activity.\nReal estate taxes increased $21.4 million as a result of successful property tax appeals in 2024, the majority of which related to prior years, as well as our acquisition activity noted above.\nHome and regional office costs increased $10.9 million and General and administrative increased $6.9 million, due to increased personnel and compensation costs.\nA loss of $8.9 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2025, included in (Loss) gain due to disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net, due to a pre-tax loss related to certain merger-related activities within Catalyst.\nIncome and other tax expense increased $12.5 million primarily due to improved operations by Catalyst.\nIncome from unconsolidated entities increased $85.4 million primarily due to improved results of operations from our other platform investments and strong performance of our domestic and international joint venture properties. \n​\n46\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe recorded net non-cash unrealized gains of $2.2 million in 2025 and net non-cash unrealized losses of $49.3 million in 2024 as a result of mark-to-market activity on publicly traded equity instruments and the change in fair value of a derivative instrument.\nDuring 2025, we recognized an $8.3 million gain related to the disposition of certain Klépierre assets and a $2.1 million gain on excess insurance proceeds.  During 2024, we recognized a $1.2 million loss on the disposition of certain Klépierre assets.\nSimon’s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $25.0 million due to a decrease in the net income of the Operating Partnership.      \nNine months ended September 30, 2025 vs. Nine months ended \nSeptember 30, 2024\nLease income increased $241.6 million, due to an increase in fixed lease income of $196.0 million primarily due to an increase in fixed minimum lease consideration and higher occupancy, an increase in variable lease income of $45.6 million and the acquisition and development activity noted above.  \nTotal other income decreased $62.6 million, primarily due to a $46.7 million decrease in interest income, a $21.1 million decrease in mixed use and franchise operations income, a $15.4 million decrease due to the 2024 land sale activity and a $4.8 million decrease in lease settlement income, partially offset by an increase of $20.0 million related to the 2025 land sale activity and a $5.4 million increase in other income sources.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $68.0 million primarily due to our acquisition and development activity.\nReal estate taxes increased $28.3 million as a result of successful property tax appeals in 2024, the majority of which related to prior years, as well as our acquisition activity noted above.\nHome and regional office costs increased $22.4 million and General and administrative increased $13.9 million, due to increased personnel and compensation costs.\nOther expenses decreased $13.5 million primarily due to a decrease in mixed use and franchise operations expenses.\nA net pre-tax gain of $71.7 million was recorded in the first nine months of 2025, included in (Loss) gain due to disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net, related to certain merger related activities within Catalyst, primarily the deconsolidation of Forever 21, and a pre-tax gain of $414.8 million was recorded in the first nine months of 2024 from selling our remaining interest in ABG.\nIncome and other tax expense decreased $12.6 million primarily due to the tax impact from the gain on sale of our remaining interest in ABG during 2024 of $103.7 million, partially offset by the 2025 non-cash tax expense related to the net gain from Catalyst noted above and increased tax expense related to improved year-over-year operations from other platform investments.\nIncome from unconsolidated entities increased $230.8 million primarily due to improved results of operations from our other platform investments and strong performance of our domestic and international joint venture properties. \nWe recorded net non-cash unrealized losses of $85.0 million in 2025 and $54.1 million in 2024 as a result of mark-to-market activity on publicly traded equity instruments and the change in fair value of a derivative instrument.\nDuring 2025, we recognized a $2.1 million gain related to excess insurance proceeds, partially offset by a $1.3 million loss on the disposition of certain Klépierre assets.  During 2024, we recognized a gain from the disposition of a property held in our TRG portfolio, our share of which was $10.6 million, partially offset by the disposition of certain Klépierre assets for a loss of $6.0 million.\nSimon’s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $8.7 million due to a decrease in the net income of the Operating Partnership. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBecause we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. Floating rate debt comprised 4.1% of our total consolidated debt at September 30, 2025. We also enter into interest rate protection agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk. We derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled $3.3 billion in the aggregate during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The Credit Facilities and the Commercial Paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. Borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below.\nOur balance of cash and cash equivalents increased $152.2 million during the first nine months of 2025 to $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2025 as a result of the operating and financing activity, as further discussed in “Cash Flows” below. \n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOn September 30, 2025, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately $7.4 billion under the Credit Facilities, net of letters of credit of $8.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the Credit Facilities was $1.0 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $756.3 million. The weighted average interest rate was 4.16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nSimon has historically had access to public equity markets and the Operating Partnership has historically had access to private and public long and short-term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level.\nOur business model and Simon’s status as a REIT require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. Simon may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the Credit Facilities and the Commercial Paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2025.\nCash Flows\nOur net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 totaled $3.3 billion. In addition, we had net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities of $880.3 million in the first nine months of 2025. These activities are further discussed below under “Financing and Debt.” During the first nine months of 2025, we also:\n●\nfunded acquisition activity for aggregate cash consideration of $961.1 million,\n●\nrecognized an increase in cash due to the acquisition and consolidation of properties of $64.9 million,\n●\npaid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling approximately $2.4 billion and preferred unit distributions totaling $3.4 million,\n●\nfunded consolidated capital expenditures of $679.4 million (including development and other costs of $20.9 million, redevelopment and expansion costs of $310.7 million, and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of $347.8 million), \n●\nfunded the redemption of $6.5 million of Operating Partnership units,\n●\nfunded investments in unconsolidated entities of $46.2 million, and\n●\nreceived proceeds from the sale of equity instruments of $87.0 million.\nIn general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses, monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and dividends to stockholders and/or distributions to partners necessary to maintain Simon’s REIT qualification on a long-term basis.  In addition, we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building redevelopments and expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from the following, however a severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the global financial markets, including the debt and equity capital markets, may affect our ability to access necessary capital:\n●\nexcess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves,\n●\nborrowings on the Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper program,\n●\nadditional secured or unsecured debt financing, or\n●\nadditional equity raised in the public or private markets.\nWe expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2025, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper program, further curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing.\nFinancing and Debt\nUnsecured Debt\nAt September 30, 2025, our unsecured debt consisted of $19.2 billion of senior unsecured notes of the Operating Partnership, a €350.0 million ($410.8 million U.S. dollar equivalent) unsecured term loan, $460.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility and €500.0 million ($586.8 million U.S. dollar equivalent) outstanding under the Supplemental Facility.\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Credit Facility has an initial borrowing capacity of $5.0 billion which may be increased in the form of additional commitments in the aggregate not to exceed $1.0 billion, for a total aggregate size of $6.0 billion, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain customary conditions precedent.  Borrowings may be denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro, Yen, Pounds Sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. Borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are limited to 97% of the maximum revolving credit amount, as defined. The initial maturity date of the Credit Facility is June 30, 2027. The Credit Facility can be extended for two additional six-month periods to June 30, 2028, at our sole option, subject to satisfying certain customary conditions precedent.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our election, at either (i) (x) for Term Benchmark Loans, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the applicable Local Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate, (y) for RFR Loans, if denominated in Sterling, SONIA plus a benchmark adjustment and if denominated in Dollars, Daily Simple SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment, or (z) for Daily SOFR Loans, the Adjusted Floating Overnight Daily SOFR Rate, in each case of clauses (x) through (z) above, plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.650% and 1.400% or (ii) for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars only, the base rate (which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.500% or Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for one month plus 1.000%) (the “Base Rate”), plus a margin determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.000% and 0.400%. The Credit Facility includes a facility fee determined by our corporate credit rating of between 0.100% and 0.300% on the aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Facility.  Based upon our current credit ratings, the interest rate on the Credit Facility is SOFR plus 70.0 basis points, plus a spread adjustment to account for the transition from LIBOR to SOFR. \nThe Supplemental Facility has a borrowing capacity of $3.5 billion, which may be increased to $4.5 billion during its term subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain customary conditions precedent, and provides for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro, Yen, Pounds, Sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. Borrowings in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are limited to 100% of the maximum revolving credit amount, as defined. The initial maturity date of the Supplemental Facility is January 31, 2029 and can be extended for an additional year to January 31, 2030 at our sole option, subject to the continued compliance with the terms thereof.\nBorrowings under the Supplemental Facility bear interest, at the Company’s election, at either (i) (x) for Term Benchmark Loans, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the applicable Local Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, the Adjusted Term CORRA Rate, or the Adjusted TIBOR Rate, (y) for RFR Loans, if denominated in Sterling, SONIA plus a benchmark adjustment, if denominated in Dollars, Daily Simple SOFR plus a benchmark adjustment, and if denominated in Canadian Dollars, Daily Simple CORRA plus a benchmark adjustment or (z) for Daily SOFR Loans, the Adjusted Floating Overnight Daily SOFR Rate, in each case of clauses (x) through (z) above, plus a margin determined by the Company’s corporate credit rating of between 0.650% and 1.400% or (ii) for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars only, the base rate (which rate is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the NYFRB Rate plus 0.500% or Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for one month plus 1.000%) (the “Base Rate”), plus a margin determined by the Company’s corporate credit rating of between 0.000% and 0.400%. The Supplemental Facility includes a facility fee determined by the Company’s corporate credit rating of between 0.100% and 0.300% on the aggregate revolving commitments under the Supplemental Facility. Based upon our current credit ratings, the interest rate on the Supplemental Facility is SOFR plus 70.0 basis points, plus a spread adjustment to account for the transition from LIBOR to SOFR.\nAt September 30, 2025, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $7.4 billion under the Credit Facilities. The maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the Credit Facilities, during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $1.0 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $756.3 million. Letters of credit of $8.6 million were outstanding under the Credit Facilities as of September 30, 2025.\nThe Operating Partnership also has available a global unsecured commercial paper note program, or Commercial Paper program, of $2.0 billion, or the non-U.S. dollar equivalent thereof.  The Operating Partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro and other currencies. Notes issued in non-U.S. currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership and are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. Notes are sold under customary terms in the U.S. and Euro commercial paper note markets and rank (either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above) pari passu with the Operating Partnership’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The Commercial Paper program is supported by the Credit Facilities and, if necessary or appropriate, we may make one or more draws under either of the Credit Facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the Commercial Paper program. On September 30, 2025, we had no outstanding balance under the Commercial Paper program. Borrowings reduce amounts otherwise available under the Credit Facilities.\nOn August 19, 2025, the Operating Partnership completed the issuance of $700 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.375% and a maturity date of October 1, 2030, and $800 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 5.125% and a maturity date of October 1, 2035. A portion of the proceeds were used to redeem, at par, its $1.1 billion 3.50% senior unsecured notes at maturity on September 1, 2025. Another portion of the proceeds were used to repay the €500 million outstanding under the Supplemental Facility on October 8, 2025.\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOn May 12, 2025, the Operating Partnership drew €500 million under the Supplemental Facility. The proceeds were used to fund the redemption at par of the Operating Partnerships €500 million notes maturing on May 13, 2025.\nOn April 25, 2025, the Operating Partnership drew $155 million under the Credit Facility.\nOn January 29, 2025, the Operating Partnership drew €376 million under the Credit Facility and used the proceeds to facilitate the acquisition of two Italian assets.  On March 13, 2025, we repaid €18 million that had been outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2024.  On March 20, 2025, the Operating Partnership entered into a €350 million unsecured term loan with a maturity date of March 20, 2027, and swapped the interest rate to an all-in fixed rate of 2.5965% which matures on March 20, 2026.  The proceeds of the term loan, along with cash on hand, were used to repay the then remaining €376 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nOn October 1, 2024, the Operating Partnership completed the redemption, at par, of its $900 million 3.38% senior unsecured notes at maturity.\nOn September 26, 2024, the Operating Partnership completed the issuance of $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.75% and with a maturity date of September 26, 2034.\nOn September 13, 2024, the Operating Partnership completed the redemption, at par, of its $1.0 billion 2.00% senior unsecured notes at maturity.\nOn February 1, 2024, the Operating Partnership completed the redemption, at par, of its $600 million 3.75% senior unsecured notes at maturity.\nMortgage Debt\nTotal mortgage indebtedness was $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. \nCovenants\nOur unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. The Credit Facilities contain ongoing covenants relating to total and secured leverage to capitalization value, minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, and unencumbered EBITDA coverage requirements.  Payment under the Credit Facilities can be accelerated if the Operating Partnership or Simon is subject to bankruptcy proceedings or upon the occurrence of certain other events. If we were to fail to comply with these covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender, including adjustments to the applicable interest rate. As of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt.\nAt September 30, 2025, our consolidated subsidiaries were the borrowers under 36 non-recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 39 properties and other assets, including two separate pools of cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of five properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. Certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties that serve as collateral for that debt. If the applicable borrower under these non-recourse mortgage notes were to fail to comply with these covenants, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its rights against their collateral. At September 30, 2025, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where non-compliance could individually or in the aggregate, giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nSummary of Financing\nOur consolidated debt, adjusted to reflect outstanding derivative instruments, and the effective weighted average interest rates as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \nEffective\n    \n​\n​\n    \nEffective\n \n​\n​\nAdjusted Balance\n​\nWeighted\n​\nAdjusted \n​\nWeighted\n \n​\n​\nas of\n​\nAverage\n​\nBalance as of\n​\nAverage\n \nDebt Subject to\n​\nSeptember 30, 2025\n \nInterest Rate(1)\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\n \nInterest Rate(1)\n​\nFixed Rate\n​\n$\n 24,719,004\n \n3.74%\n​\n$\n 24,035,060\n \n3.61%\n​\nVariable Rate\n​\n \n 1,070,051\n \n3.57%\n​\n \n 229,435\n \n5.47%\n​\n​\n​\n$\n 25,789,055\n \n3.73%\n​\n$\n 24,264,495\n \n3.62%\n​\n(1)\nEffective weighted average interest rate excludes the impact of net discounts and debt issuance costs.\n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nThere have been no material changes to our outstanding capital expenditure and lease commitments previously disclosed in the combined 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership.\nIn regards to long-term debt arrangements, the following table summarizes the material aspects of these future obligations on our consolidated indebtedness as of September 30, 2025, for the remainder of 2025 and subsequent years thereafter (dollars in thousands), assuming the obligations remain outstanding through initial maturities, including applicable exercise of available extension options:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2025\n    \n2026-2027\n    \n2028-2029\n    \nAfter 2029\n    \nTotal\n \nLong Term Debt (1)\n​\n$\n 658,350\n​\n$\n 8,407,799\n​\n$\n 3,178,773\n​\n$\n 13,683,062\n​\n$\n 25,927,984\n​\nInterest Payments (2)\n​\n \n 240,357\n​\n \n 1,519,499\n​\n \n 1,185,208\n​\n \n 5,376,489\n​\n \n 8,321,553\n​\n(1)\nRepresents principal maturities only and, therefore, excludes net discounts and debt issuance costs.\n(2)\nVariable rate interest payments are estimated based on the SOFR or other applicable rate at September 30, 2025.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in Note 6 of the condensed notes to our consolidated financial statements. Our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. The joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage, is without recourse to the joint venture partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners, except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt. In addition to the guarantee disclosed in Note 6, as of September 30, 2025, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint venture-related mortgage indebtedness of $122.9 million.  Mortgages guaranteed by the Operating Partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount. We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise.    \nSubsequent Event\nOn October 31, 2025, we closed on the acquisition of the remaining 12% interest in TRG that we did not own in exchange for approximately 5.06 million units in the Operating Partnership.  TRG will be consolidated and the acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination requiring a remeasurement of our previously held equity interest to fair value, resulting in the recognition of a non-cash gain which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2025.     \nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nBuy-sell, marketing rights, and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements. Most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. We and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions). If we determine it is in our stockholders’ best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partner’s interest. If we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion opportunities.\nAcquisitions. \nOn June 27, 2025, we acquired the remaining 75% interest in the retail component and 100% of the parking component of Brickell City Centre resulting in the consolidation of the retail component which had previously been accounted for under the equity method. The cash consideration for this transaction, including working capital, was $497.7 million. Cash acquired was $24.0 million.\n \n​\nOn April 1, 2025, we acquired the remaining interest in Briarwood Mall from a joint venture partner, resulting in the consolidation of this property. The cash consideration for this transaction, including working capital, was $9.2 million. Cash acquired was $14.7 million. The property is subject to a $165 million 3.29% fixed rate mortgage loan. \n​\nOn January 30, 2025, we completed the acquisition of a 100% interest in two luxury outlet destinations in Italy, The Mall Luxury Outlets Firenze, in Leccio, nearby Florence, and The Mall Luxury Outlets Sanremo, in Sanremo on the Italian Riviera. The cash consideration including working capital and capitalized transaction costs was $392.4 million. Cash acquired was $25.3 million. The properties are unencumbered.\n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we acquired the remaining interest in Smith Haven Mall from a joint venture partner, resulting in the consolidation of this property.  The cash consideration for this transaction was $56.1 million, which included cash acquired of $35.8 million. The property was subject to a $160.8 million 8.10% variable rate mortgage loan.  This mortgage loan was paid off prior to December 31, 2024.  \nOn February 6, 2024, we acquired an additional interest in Miami International Mall from a joint venture partner, resulting in the consolidation of this property. The cash consideration for this transactions was de minimis. The property is subject to a $158.0 million 6.92% fixed rate mortgage loan.\nDispositions.  \nWe may continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or that are not a primary retail venue within their trade area.\nDuring 2024, we disposed of our interest in two consolidated properties and one unconsolidated entity. The combined total proceeds from these transactions were $55.2 million, resulting in a net loss of $67.2 million.  \nJoint Venture Formation and Other Investment Activity\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we participated in the formation of a joint venture, Phoenix Retail, LLC, to acquire the Express Retail Company and operate Express and Bonobos direct-to-consumer businesses in the United States, from the previous owner on June 21, 2024, in a bankruptcy proceeding.  There was no cash consideration transferred for our 39.4% noncontrolling interest and non-cash consideration was de minimis.  \nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we sold all of our remaining interest in ABG for cash proceeds of $1.2 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $414.8 million, which is included in gain on disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net, in the consolidated statement of operations. In connection with this transaction, we recorded tax expense of $103.7 million, which is included in income and other tax (expense) benefit in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.     \nDevelopment Activity\nWe routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties. Redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, restaurants, as well as office space and residential uses are underway at properties in North America.\nConstruction continues on certain redevelopment and new development projects in the U.S. and internationally that are nearing completion.  Our share of the costs of all new development, redevelopment and expansion projects currently under construction is approximately $1.3 billion.  Simon’s share of remaining net cash funding required to complete the new development and redevelopment projects currently under construction in the remainder of 2025 and 2026 is approximately $478 million.  We expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations. We seek a stabilized return on invested capital in the range of 8-10% for all of our new development, expansion and redevelopment projects.  \nInternational Development Activity.\n  We typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity. We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies. We have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency-denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. Our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the Euro, Yen, Peso, Won, and other foreign currencies is not material. We expect our share of estimated committed capital for international development projects to be completed with projected delivery in 2025 or 2026 is $13 million, primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans.  \nThe following table describes these new development and expansion projects as well as our share of the estimated total cost as of September 30, 2025 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nGross\n​\nOur\n​\nOur Share of\n​\nOur Share of\n​\nProjected/Actual\n​\n​\n​\n​\nLeasable\n​\nOwnership\n​\nProjected Net Cost\n​\nProjected Net Cost\n​\nOpening\nProperty\n   \nLocation\n   \nArea (sqft)\n   \nPercentage\n   \n(in Local Currency)\n   \n(in USD) (1)\n   \nDate\nNew Development Projects:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nJakarta Premium Outlets\n​\nJakarta, Indonesia\n​\n 300,000\n​\n50%\n​\nIDR\n 931,782\n​\n$\n 55.9\n​\nOpened Mar. - 2025\n(1)\nUSD equivalent based upon September 30, 2025 foreign currency exchange rates\n.\nDividends, Distributions and Stock Repurchase Program\nSimon paid a common stock dividend of $2.15 per share for the third quarter of 2025 and $6.35 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.  Simon paid common stock dividends of $6.00 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  The Operating Partnership paid distributions per unit for the same amounts.  On November 3, 2025, Simon’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2025 of $2.20 per share, payable on December 31, 2025 to \n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\nshareholders of record on December 10, 2025.  The distribution rate on units is equal to the dividend rate on common stock.  In order to maintain its status as a REIT, Simon must pay a minimum amount of dividends. Simon’s future dividends and the Operating Partnership’s future distributions will be determined by Simon’s Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, based on actual and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures, financing covenants, if any, and the amount required to maintain Simon’s status as a REIT. \nOn February 8, 2024, Simon's Board of Directors authorized a new common stock repurchase plan which immediately replaced the existing repurchase plan.  Under the plan, Simon may repurchase up to $2.0 billion of its common stock during the two-year period commencing on February 8, 2024 and ending on February 8, 2026 in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant.  As of September 30, 2025, no shares had been purchased under the plan.  As Simon repurchases shares under the plan, the Operating Partnership repurchases an equal number of units from Simon.  \nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may be deemed \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that the Company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward–looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.\n \nSuch factors include, but are not limited to: the intensely competitive market environment in the retail real estate industry, the retail industry, including e-commerce; the inability to renew leases and relet vacant space at existing properties on favorable terms; the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise; the potential loss of anchor stores or major tenants; an increase in vacant space at our properties; the loss of key management personnel; changes in economic and market conditions that may adversely affect the general retail environment, including but not limited to those caused by inflation, the impact of tariffs and global trade disruptions on us to the extent impacting our tenants, recessionary pressures, wars, escalating geopolitical tensions as a result of the war in Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, and supply chain disruptions; the potential for violence, civil unrest, criminal activity or terrorist activities at our properties; the availability of comprehensive insurance coverage; security breaches that could compromise our information technology or infrastructure; changes in market rates of interest; our international activities subjecting us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations, including changes in foreign exchange rates; the impact of our substantial indebtedness on our future operations, including covenants in the governing agreements that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate freely; any disruption in the financial markets that may adversely affect our ability to access capital for growth and satisfy our ongoing debt service requirements; any change in our credit rating; our continued ability to maintain our status as a REIT; changes in tax laws or regulations that result in adverse tax consequences; risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment, expansion, leasing and management of properties; the inability to lease newly developed properties on favorable terms; risks relating to our joint venture properties, including guarantees of certain joint venture indebtedness; reducing emissions of greenhouse gases; environmental liabilities; natural disasters; uncertainties regarding the impact of pandemics, epidemics or public health crises, and the associated governmental restrictions on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity; and general risks related to real estate investments, including the illiquidity of real estate investments. The Company discusses these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in its annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC.  The Company may update that discussion in subsequent other periodic reports, but except as required by law, the Company undertakes no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIndustry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as FFO, real estate FFO, diluted FFO per share, real estate FFO per share, NOI, beneficial interest of combined NOI and portfolio NOI. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs and provide a relevant basis for comparison among REITs. We also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.  We are providing different components of NOI, such as Portfolio NOI (a component of beneficial interest of combined NOI that relates to the operational performance of our global real estate portfolio), to provide investors with disaggregated information to further differentiate our global real estate portfolio performance from corporate and other platform investments.\nWe determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement.  Our main business includes acquiring, owning, operating, developing, and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with the rental of real estate.  Gain and losses of assets incidental to our \n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmain business are included in FFO.  We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP:\n●\nexcluding real estate related depreciation and amortization,\n●\nexcluding gains and losses from extraordinary items,\n●\nexcluding gains and losses from the acquisition of controlling interest, sale, disposal or property insurance recoveries of, or any impairment related to, depreciable retail operating properties,\n●\nplus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and\n●\nall determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.\nWe determine real estate FFO utilizing the definition of FFO as stated above excluding the impact of operations from \n●\nOther Platform Investments, net of tax,\n●\ngains or losses due to disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net of tax, and\n●\nunrealized gains or losses in fair value of publicly traded equity instruments and derivative instruments.\nYou should understand that our computations of these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other REITs and that these non-GAAP measures:\n●\ndo not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,\n●\nshould not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and\n●\nare not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following schedule reconciles total FFO and real estate FFO to consolidated net income and, for Simon, diluted net income per share to diluted FFO per share and real estate FFO per
