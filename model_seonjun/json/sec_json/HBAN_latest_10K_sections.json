Financial Technology Companies, or FinTechs, are also providing nontraditional, but increasingly strong, competition for our borrowers, depositors, and other customers.\nWe compete for loans primarily on the basis of value and service by building customer relationships through addressing our customers’ entire suite of banking needs, demonstrating expertise, and providing convenience. We also consider the competitive pricing levels in each of our markets.\nWe compete for deposits similarly on the basis of value and service and by providing convenience through a banking network of branches and ATMs within our markets and our website at www.huntington.com. We employ customer friendly practices, such as a $50 Safety Zone®, which prevents customers from being charged an overdraft fee if they overdraw by $50 or less, 24-Hour Grace® account feature for both commercial and consumer accounts, which gives customers an additional business day to cover overdrafts to their account without being charged overdraft fees, Early Pay, which allows customers with direct deposit availability to their paycheck up to two days early, Instant Access, which allows up to $500 of a check deposit available to customers immediately, and Asterisk-Free Checking where there is no cost to open and no monthly maintenance fees. In addition, customers can qualify for Standby Cash®\n \nbased primarily on their checking deposit history, not their credit score, which provides a $100 to $500 short-term line of credit free with automatic payments, or a 1% monthly interest charge without automatic payments. Huntington also has created a feature called Money Scout®, which is a tool that analyzes a customer’s spending habits and moves money that is not being used into that customer’s savings account and have introduced tools including The Hub and Huntington Heads Up® to provide customers greater visibility and control over their financial future. These measures fall under our approach of “Fair Play Banking.” \n10\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nThe table below shows our competitive ranking and market share based on deposits of FDIC-insured institutions as of June 30, 2024, in the top 10 MSAs in which we compete.\nMSA\nRank\nDeposits\n(in millions)\nMarket Share\nColumbus, OH\n1 \n$\n44,814 \n43 \n%\nDetroit, MI\n5 \n17,398 \n9 \nCleveland, OH\n2 \n15,595 \n12 \nChicago, IL\n11 \n9,667 \n2 \nMinneapolis-St. Paul, MN\n4 \n6,604 \n3 \nGrand Rapids, MI\n1 \n5,756 \n19 \nIndianapolis, IN\n5 \n5,493 \n6 \nAkron, OH\n1 \n5,191 \n28 \nCincinnati, OH\n5 \n4,735 \n3 \nPittsburgh, PA\n7 \n4,682 \n2 \nSource: FDIC.gov, based on June 30, 2024 survey.\nMany of our nonfinancial institution competitors have fewer regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas, access to a larger pool of capital to deploy, and, in some cases, lower cost structures. In addition, competition for quality customers has intensified as a result of changes in regulation, advances in technology and product delivery systems, and consolidation among financial service providers.\nFinTechs continue to emerge in key areas of banking. In addition, larger established technology platform companies continue to evaluate, and in some cases, create businesses focused on banking products. We closely monitor activity in the marketplace to ensure that our products and services are technologically competitive.  Further, we continue to invest in and evolve our innovation program to develop, incubate, and launch new products and services driving ongoing differentiated value for our customers. Our overall strategy involves an active corporate development program that seeks to identify partnership and possible investment opportunities in technology-driven companies that can augment our distribution and product capabilities. \nRegulatory Matters\nRegulatory Environment\nThe banking industry is highly regulated. We are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by various federal and state regulators, including the Federal Reserve, OCC, SEC, CFPB, FDIC, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies. The statutory and regulatory framework that governs us is generally intended to protect depositors and customers, the DIF, the U.S. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole.\nBanking statutes, regulations, and policies are continually under review by Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters, and similar written guidance applicable to Huntington and its subsidiaries. Any change in the statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to us, including changes in their interpretation or implementation, could have a material effect on our business or organization. \nHuntington and the Bank each qualify as a Category IV banking organization subject to the least restrictive of the requirements applicable to firms with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. Our business, however, remains subject to extensive regulation and supervision, and the U.S. banking agencies may issue additional rules to tailor the application of certain other regulatory requirements to BHCs and banks, including Huntington and the Bank. The scope of laws and regulations and the intensity of supervision to which we are subject has increased in response to the banking turmoil in early 2023, technological factors, market changes, and climate change concerns, and there is increased scrutiny and possible denials of bank mergers and acquisitions by federal banking regulators.\nWe are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC, as well as the rules of Nasdaq that apply to companies with securities listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n11\nTable of \nContents\nThe following discussion describes certain elements of the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to us. This discussion is not intended to describe all laws and regulations applicable to Huntington, the Bank, and Huntington’s other subsidiaries.\nSupervision, Examination and Enforcement\nHuntington is a BHC under the BHC Act that has elected to be an FHC. FHCs may engage in, and be affiliated with, companies engaging in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a BHC, so long as such activities are (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of a depository institution or to the financial system generally. These activities include, for example, securities underwriting, securities dealing, making a market in securities, making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies, and engaging in insurance underwriting and agency activities. To become and remain eligible for FHC status, a BHC and its subsidiary depository institutions must meet certain criteria, including capital, management, and CRA requirements. Failure to meet such criteria could result, depending on which requirements were not met, in restrictions on new financial activities or acquisitions, or being required to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for BHCs. \nHuntington is subject to primary supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve, which serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization. The primary regulators of our non-bank subsidiaries directly regulate the activities of those subsidiaries, with the Federal Reserve exercising a supervisory role. Such non-bank subsidiaries include, for example, broker-dealers and investment advisers both registered with the SEC.\nThe Bank is a national banking association chartered under the laws of the U.S. As a national bank, the activities of the Bank are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and OCC regulations. The Bank is subject to comprehensive primary supervision, regulation, and examination by the OCC. As a member of the DIF, the Bank is also subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC.\nA principal objective of the U.S. bank regulatory regime is to protect depositors and customers, the DIF, the U.S. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole, by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of BHCs and banks, including Huntington and the Bank. Bank regulators regularly examine the operations of BHCs and banks. In addition, BHCs and banks are subject to periodic reporting and filing requirements.\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC have broad supervisory and enforcement authority with regard to BHCs and banks, including the power to conduct examinations and investigations, impose nonpublic supervisory agreements, issue cease and desist orders, impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, terminate deposit insurance, and appoint a conservator or receiver. In addition, Huntington, the Bank, and other Huntington subsidiaries are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the CFPB, which is the primary administrator of most federal consumer financial statutes and Huntington’s primary consumer financial regulator. Supervision and examinations are confidential, and the outcomes of these actions may not be made public.\nBank regulators have various remedies available if they determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of a banking organization’s operations are unsatisfactory. The regulators may also take action if they determine that the banking organization or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation. The regulators have the power to, among other things, (1) prohibit unsafe or unsound practices, (2) require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice, (3) issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced, (4) direct increases in capital, (5) direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets, (6) limit dividends and distributions, (7) restrict growth, (8) assess civil monetary penalties, (9) remove officers and directors, and (10) terminate deposit insurance.\nEngaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory agreements could subject the Company, its subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors, and institution-affiliated parties to the remedies described above, and other sanctions. In addition, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the bank’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the bank has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated an applicable rule, regulation, order, or condition enacted or imposed by the bank’s regulatory agency.\n12\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nHuntington is subject to the Federal Reserve’s LFI Rating System, which places a greater emphasis on capital and liquidity, including related planning and risk management practices, as compared to the supervisory rating system applicable to smaller BHCs. These ratings are confidential.\nPause on Major Federal Reserve Rulemakings\nIn January 2025, the Federal Reserve stated that Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr would step down from the position, effective, February 28, 2025. The Federal Reserve stated that it will not issue any major rulemakings from the time of the announcement until a new vice chair for supervision is confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\nBank Acquisitions by Huntington\nBHCs, such as Huntington, must obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve in connection with any acquisition that results in the BHC owning or controlling 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or another BHC.\nLate in the term of the Biden administration, the standards by which bank and financial institution acquisitions would be evaluated have been undergoing review and change by the OCC and the DOJ, but not by the Federal Reserve. These reviews and changes were incorporated into non-binding guidance. Whether and how the guidance might be further changed or interpreted by the Trump administration is uncertain.\nIn September 2024, the OCC adopted a final rule and policy statement regarding its review of Bank Merger Act applications for OCC-supervised institutions, including the Bank. The final rule removes the ability for Bank Merger Act applicants to file a streamlined application form for certain types of acquisitions and removes the expedited review process for Bank Merger Act applications. The policy statement provides 19 indicators of whether a Bank Merger Act application is more or less likely to be approved by the OCC. The policy statement also provides heightened expectations around the existing statutory factors the OCC is required to consider in evaluating Bank Merger Act applications.\nIn September 2024, the DOJ withdrew its 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines and issued the 2024 Banking Addendum. The DOJ clarified that it will assess competition considerations in connection with bank and bank holding company mergers using its 2023 Merger Guidelines, which is the general merger review framework the DOJ now uses to evaluate transactions in all segments of the economy, and the 2024 Banking Addendum. The 2024 Banking Addendum provides guidance on how the DOJ will assess competition in the context of bank and bank holding company mergers. An analysis under the 2023 Merger Guidelines and 2024 Banking Addendum may include consideration of theories of harm and relevant markets not considered under the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, which focused primarily on concentrations of deposits and branches.\nAcquisitions of Ownership of the Company\nAcquisitions of Huntington’s voting stock above certain thresholds are subject to prior regulatory notice or approval under federal banking laws, including the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares in our stock.\nInterstate Banking\nUnder the Riegle-Neal Act, a BHC may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the BHC not control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the BHC’s initial entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state). The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate branches. A national bank, such as the Bank, with the approval of the OCC may open a branch in any state if the law of that state would permit a state bank chartered in that state to establish the branch.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n13\nTable of \nContents\nEnhanced Prudential Standards\nBHCs with consolidated assets of more than $100 billion, such as Huntington, are currently subject to certain enhanced prudential standards. As a result, Huntington is subject to more stringent standards, including liquidity and capital requirements, leverage limits, stress testing, resolution planning, and risk management standards, than those applicable to institutions with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets. Certain larger banking organizations are subject to additional enhanced prudential standards. As a Category IV banking organization, Huntington is subject to the least restrictive enhanced prudential standards applicable to firms with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets.\nLiquidity Requirements\nHuntington, as a Category IV banking organization with less than $50 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, is exempt from the LCR and net stable funding ratio requirements but continues to be subject to internal liquidity stress tests and standards.\nLong-term Debt Requirements\nIn August 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposed rule that would require certain large banking organizations such as Huntington to comply with long-term debt requirements and “clean holding company requirements” similar to those that currently only apply to U.S. global systemically important banking organizations. This proposal would also impose a long-term debt requirement on certain categories of insured depository institutions that are not consolidated subsidiaries of U.S. global systematically important banking organizations, including insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in total assets, such as the Bank. If adopted, this proposal, would require Huntington and the Bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amount of no less than the greater of (i) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (ii) 2.5% of total leverage exposure (if subject to the supplementary leverage ratio), or (iii) 3.5% of average total consolidated assets. To comply with the requirement, the Bank would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible long-term debt to Huntington, and Huntington would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible long-term debt externally. The proposal allows banking organizations to include, as part of the required minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amounts, certain existing long-term debt. Once the rule is finalized, covered institutions would have three years to comply with the new requirements following a phased-in approach, with 25% of the long-term debt requirement by one year after finalization of the rule, 50% after two years, and 100% after three years.\nIn addition, if adopted as proposed, the “clean holding company requirements” would limit or prohibit Huntington from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution, including, for example, prohibiting Huntington from entering into transactions that could spread losses to subsidiaries and third parties, as well as limiting the amount of the Company’s liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt. The timing and form of any final rule implementing the long-term debt requirements and clean holding company requirements remains uncertain.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nHuntington and the Bank are subject to certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements under the U.S. Basel III capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve, for Huntington, and by the OCC, for the Bank. These rules implement the Basel III international regulatory capital standards in the U.S., as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These quantitative calculations are minimums, and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner.\nUnder the U.S. Basel III capital rules, Huntington’s and the Bank’s assets, exposures, and certain off-balance sheet items are subject to risk weights used to determine the institutions’ risk-weighted assets. These risk-weighted assets are used to calculate the following minimum capital ratios for Huntington and the Bank:\n•\nCET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio\n, equal to the ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital primarily includes common shareholders’ equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions, including goodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, and AOCI.\n•\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio\n, equal to the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of CET1 capital, perpetual preferred stock, and certain qualifying capital instruments. \n14\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\n•\nTotal Risk-Based Capital Ratio\n, equal to the ratio of total capital, including CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital, to risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying ALLL. Tier 2 capital also includes, among other things, certain trust preferred securities. \n•\nTier 1 Leverage Ratio\n, equal to the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets (net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain other deductions). \nHuntington and the Bank elected to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital pursuant to a rule that allowed BHCs and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. As of December 31, 2024, we have phased in 75% of the cumulative CECL deferral with the full cumulative CECL deferral fully phased in beginning January 1, 2025.\nThe total minimum regulatory capital ratios and well-capitalized minimum ratios are reflected in the table below in this section. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for BHCs to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the U.S. Basel III capital rules. For purposes of the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y, including determining whether a BHC meets the requirements to be an FHC, BHCs, such as Huntington, must maintain a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6.0% or greater and a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to BHCs as that applicable to the Bank, Huntington’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2024, would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. The Federal Reserve may require BHCs, including Huntington, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a BHC’s particular condition, risk profile, and growth plans.\nFailure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on Huntington’s or the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications.\nIn addition to meeting the minimum capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, Huntington and the Bank must maintain the applicable capital buffer (SCB and CCB, respectively) requirements to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management. Huntington is subject to a SCB of 2.5% effective October 1, 2024. Refer to the SCB Requirements section below for further details. The Bank is subject to a CCB of 2.5%. The Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is not impacted by the SCB or CCB, and a banking institution may be considered well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the SCB or CCB. \nThe following table presents the minimum regulatory capital ratios, minimum ratio plus the capital buffer, and well-capitalized minimums compared with Huntington’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2024, calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable as of the end of 2024.\nMinimum Regulatory Capital Ratio\nMinimum Ratio + Capital Buffer (1)\nWell-Capitalized\nMinimums (2)\nAt December 31, 2024\nActual\nRatios:\nCET1 risk-based capital ratio\nConsolidated\n4.5 \n%\n7.0 \n%\nN/A\n10.5 \n%\nBank\n4.5 \n7.0 \n6.5 \n%\n11.6 \nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio\nConsolidated\n6.0 \n8.5 \n6.0 \n11.9 \nBank\n6.0 \n8.5 \n8.0 \n12.4 \nTotal risk-based capital ratio\nConsolidated\n8.0 \n10.5 \n10.0 \n14.3 \nBank\n8.0 \n10.5 \n10.0 \n14.1 \nTier 1 leverage ratio\nConsolidated\n4.0 \nN/A\nN/A\n8.6 \nBank\n4.0 \nN/A\n5.0 \n8.9 \n(1)    Reflects a SCB of 2.5% for both Huntington and the Bank.\n(2)    Reflects the well-capitalized standard applicable to Huntington under Federal Reserve Regulation Y and the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Bank.\nHuntington has the ability to provide additional capital to the Bank to maintain the Bank’s risk-based capital ratios at levels which would be considered well-capitalized.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n15\nTable of \nContents\nAs of December 31, 2024, Huntington’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were above the well-capitalized standards and met the applicable capital buffer requirements.\nBasel III Endgame Proposal\nIn July 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposed rule to implement the Basel III endgame agreement for large banks (2023 Basel III Endgame Proposal). The proposal is aimed at significantly increasing capital requirements for large banks, particularly in the US, by mandating them to hold more capital against potential risks like credit, market, and operational risks.\nIt is uncertain if and when a final rule will be adopted, and if so, whether and to what extent it will differ from the 2023 Basel III Endgame Proposal.\n \nAs a result, the timing and content of any final rule, and the potential effects of any final rule on Huntington and the Bank, remain uncertain. \nCapital Planning and Stress Testing\n Huntington is required to develop, maintain, and submit to the Federal Reserve a capital plan every year, which is subject to supervisory review in connection with the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process. Huntington is required to include within its capital plan an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, a detailed description of the process for assessing capital adequacy, its capital policy, and a discussion of any expected changes to its business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy. Under the stress buffer requirements, the CCAR process is used to determine a BHC’s SCB requirement. Please refer to the SCB Requirements section below for further details. \nThe Federal Reserve expects BHCs subject to CCAR, such as Huntington, to have sufficient capital to withstand a highly adverse operating environment and to be able to continue operations, maintain ready access to funding, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, and serve as credit intermediaries. In addition, the Federal Reserve evaluates the planned capital actions of these BHCs, including planned capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. This involves a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisory-run stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above certain minimum ratios, after taking into consideration all capital actions included in a BHC’s capital plan, under baseline and stressful conditions throughout the nine-quarter planning horizon. As part of CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates whether BHCs have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether they have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks. We are generally prohibited from making a capital distribution unless, after giving effect to the distribution, we will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios. Huntington may increase certain types of capital distributions in excess of the amount included in its capital plan without seeking prior approval from the Federal Reserve as long as it otherwise complies with the automatic restrictions on distributions under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve is no longer allowed to object to the capital plan of a large and non-complex BHC, such as Huntington, on a qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, basis, the Federal Reserve may evaluate the strength of Huntington’s qualitative capital planning process through the regular supervisory process and targeted horizontal reviews of particular aspects of capital planning. \nSCB Requirements\nFor risk-based capital requirements, Huntington, as a large BHC, is provided an SCB by the Federal Reserve that is determined annually based on the greater of (i) the difference between its starting and minimum projected CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test, plus the sum of the dollar amount of Huntington’s planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, or (ii) 2.5%. On April 5, 2024, Huntington submitted its 2024 Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve for supervisory review. By notice dated June 26, 2024, the Federal Reserve informed Huntington that, effective October 1, 2024, its indicative SCB requirement associated with its 2024 Capital Plan is the prescribed minimum SCB of 2.5%, a decrease from its previous SCB of 3.2%.\nHuntington is authorized to make capital distributions that are consistent with the requirements in the Federal Reserve’s capital rule, inclusive of the SCB requirement. Provided that Huntington is otherwise in compliance with automatic restrictions on distributions under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules, Huntington is not required to seek prior approval to make capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan. \n16\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nRestrictions on Dividends\nHuntington is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Since our consolidated net income consists largely of net income of Huntington’s subsidiaries, our ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends and repurchasing shares, depends upon our receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries. Under federal law, there are various limitations on the extent to which the Bank can declare and pay dividends to Huntington, including those related to regulatory capital requirements, general regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices, and federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits, surplus, and available earnings. Certain contractual restrictions also may limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Huntington. No assurances can be given that the Bank will, in any circumstances, pay dividends to Huntington. \nHuntington’s ability to declare and pay dividends to our shareholders is similarly limited by federal banking law and Federal Reserve regulations and policy. As discussed in the Capital Planning section above, in general, a BHC may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve and as to which the Federal Reserve has not objected. \nHuntington and the Bank must maintain the applicable capital buffer requirements to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions, including dividends. For more information on the capital buffer requirements, see the SCB Requirements and the Regulatory Capital Requirements sections above.\n The Federal Reserve has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for a BHC to pay dividends unless a its net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with its capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve could prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by a BHC if it determines that payment of the dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.\nVolcker Rule\nUnder the Volcker Rule, we are prohibited from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for our own account and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds (covered funds). The Volcker Rule regulations contain exemptions for market-making, hedging, underwriting, trading in U.S. government and agency obligations, and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of covered funds to be retained. They also permit the offering and sponsoring of covered funds under certain conditions. The Volcker Rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities, such as Huntington. We have put in place the compliance programs required by the Volcker Rule and any holdings in illiquid covered funds are in compliance with the Volcker Rule. \nResolution Planning\nAs a Category IV banking organization, Huntington is not required to submit a resolution plan to the Federal Reserve. As an insured depository institution, the Bank is required to file a resolution plan with the FDIC, and the Bank submitted its most recent resolution plan to the FDIC on November 30, 2022. In June 2024, the FDIC adopted a final rule to modify the required frequency and informational content of resolution plan submissions applicable to insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, including the Bank, which describe the insured depository institution’s strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. As a result of the final rule, the Bank will be required to submit to the FDIC full resolution plans every three years and interim targeted information between full resolution plan submissions. In addition, the final rule introduces a new credibility standard that will be used to evaluate full resolution plan submissions. If the FDIC finds an insured depository institution’s resolution plan to be not credible, it could subject the insured depository institution to an enforcement action. The final rule became effective October 1, 2024 and the deadline for the Bank’s first resolution plan submission under the final rule is July 1, 2025.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n17\nTable of \nContents\nSource of Strength\nHuntington is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank and, under appropriate conditions, to commit resources to support the Bank. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of Huntington or our shareholders or creditors. The Federal Reserve may require a BHC to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the BHC with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the BHC fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the Federal Reserve believes might jeopardize the BHC’s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank.\nUnder these requirements, Huntington may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress. Capital loans by Huntington to the Bank would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the Bank. In the event of Huntington’s bankruptcy, any commitment by Huntington to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.\nFDIC as Receiver or Conservator of Huntington\nUpon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, the FDIC may be appointed as the conservator or receiver of the institution. Under the Orderly Liquidation Authority, upon the insolvency of a BHC, such as Huntington, the FDIC may be appointed as conservator or receiver of the BHC, if certain findings are made by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the President. Acting as a conservator or receiver, the FDIC would have broad powers to transfer any assets or liabilities of the institution without the approval of the institution’s creditors.\nDepositor Preference\nThe FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, including the Bank, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver would have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If the Bank were to fail, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, would have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including Huntington, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.\nTransactions between a Bank and its Affiliates\nFederal banking laws and regulations impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions between a bank and its affiliates, including between a bank and its holding company and companies that the BHC may be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’s-length terms and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the Bank’s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the BHC may be required to provide it. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the coverage and scope of these regulations, including by applying them to the credit exposure arising under derivative transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by FDIC-insured banks, such as the Bank, and their subsidiaries to their directors, executive officers, and principal shareholders.\nLending Standards and Guidance\nThe federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. Under these regulations, all insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, must adopt and maintain written policies establishing appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, and documentation, approval, and reporting requirements. The real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the federal bank regulatory agencies’ Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies.\n18\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nHeightened Governance and Risk Management Standards\nThe OCC has published guidelines to set expectations for the governance and risk management practices of certain large financial institutions, including the Bank. The guidelines require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risk-taking activities. In addition, the guidelines provide standards for the institutions’ boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework. As discussed in the “\nRisk Management and Capital\n” section of the MD&A, the Bank currently has a written governance framework and associated controls.\nAnti-Money Laundering\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act and Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions such as depository institutions to undertake activities, including maintaining an AML program, verifying the identity of customers, verifying the identity of certain beneficial owners for legal entity customers, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and, therefore, is required to implement compliance policies, procedures, and internal controls, provide its employees with AML training, designate an AML compliance officer, and undergo a periodic independent auditing and testing to assess the effectiveness of its AML program, among other requirements. The Bank has implemented an AML compliance program, including policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these AML requirements. Bank regulators continue to focus their examinations on AML compliance, and we will continue to monitor and augment, where necessary, our AML compliance programs, including the Bank’s. The federal banking agencies are required, when reviewing bank and BHC acquisition or merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the AML activities of the applicant.\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, does not directly impose new requirements on banks, but requires the U.S. Treasury to issue National Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Priorities, and conduct studies and issue regulations that may, over the next few years, significantly alter some of the due diligence, recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the Bank Secrecy Act imposes on banks. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 also contains provisions that promote increased information-sharing and use of technology and increases penalties for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and includes whistleblower incentives, both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement. \nOFAC Regulation\nOFAC is the primary U.S. regulatory authority responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, and others, as defined by various Executive Orders and in various legislation. OFAC-administered sanctions take many different forms. For example, sanctions may include: (1) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (2) a blocking of assets in which the government or “specially designated nationals” of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons. OFAC also publishes lists of blocked or designated persons, organizations, and entities, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. Blocked assets, for example property and bank deposits, cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. Other jurisdictions and multilateral bodies also administer and impose sanctions.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n19\nTable of \nContents\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy\nFederal and state legislation and regulations contain extensive cybersecurity and data privacy provisions.  Our regulatory agencies including the CFPB, FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC also have oversight over us, the Bank, and our subsidiaries with respect to cybersecurity and data privacy. Huntington and its subsidiaries are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the CFPB and Federal Trade Commission, which regulates unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including with respect to cybersecurity and data privacy. Further, the GLBA, and its regulations such as Regulation P, require financial institutions to disclose their data privacy policies and practices relating to sharing personal information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share their personal information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. The GLBA and its regulations require financial institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. An amendment to Regulation S-P, an implementing regulation under the GLBA, was adopted by the SEC on May 16, 2024 and requires registered investment advisers and broker-dealers to, among other things, adopt and implement an incident response program as part of their formal cybersecurity policies and procedures and report data breaches to affected individuals whose sensitive customer information was, or is reasonably likely to have been, accessed or used without authorization within 30 days of becoming aware of such data breach. Federal law also makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means. Moreover, the U.S. Congress has recently considered, and is currently considering, various proposals for more comprehensive cybersecurity and data privacy legislation, to which we may be subject if passed.\nLike other lenders, the Bank and other of our subsidiaries also use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the FCRA, and the FCRA also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of information between affiliates, and using affiliate data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on us and our subsidiaries.\nThe CISA is intended to improve cybersecurity in the U.S. by enhanced sharing of information about security threats among the U.S. government and private sector entities, including financial institutions, and empowers the CISA Agency to oversee this information sharing process. The CISA also authorizes companies to monitor their own systems notwithstanding any other provision of law and allows companies to carry out defensive measures on their own systems from cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches. The law includes liability protections for companies that share cyber-threat information with third parties so long as such sharing activity is conducted in accordance with the CISA. In addition, the enactment of the CIRCIA in 2022, once rulemaking is complete, will require, among other things, certain companies to report significant cyber incidents to the CISA Agency within 72 hours from the time the company reasonably believes the incident occurred (and within 24 hours of making a ransom payment as a result of a ransomware attack). On April 4, 2024, the CISA Agency proposed a rule under the CIRCIA that would clarify the scope of cyber incidents to be reported and would further define covered entities subject to the CIRCIA to expressly include companies in the financial services industry that are required to report cyber incidents to their primary federal regulators.\nIn addition, effective April 1, 2022, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued a rule that, among other things, requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator as soon as possible and within 36 hours after identifying a “computer-security incident” that the banking organization believes in good faith could materially disrupt, degrade or impair its business or operations in a manner that would, among other things, jeopardize the viability of its operations, result in customers being unable to access their deposit and other accounts, result in a material loss of revenue, profit or franchise value, or pose a threat to the stability of the U.S. financial sector.\n20\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nCybersecurity and data privacy are also areas of increasing state legislative focus. For example, under California state law, the CCPA broadly defines personal information and substantially increases the rights of California residents to understand how their personal information is collected, used, and otherwise processed by commercial businesses, such as affording them the right to access and request deletion of their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. The CCPA contemplates civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation and up to $7,500 for each intentional violation and includes a private right of action (permitting lawsuits to be brought by private individuals instead of the state Attorney General or other government actor for certain breaches). Numerous other states have enacted, or are considering enacting, comprehensive data privacy laws that share similarities with the CCPA. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach.\nOur cybersecurity and data privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations as applicable.\nFDIC Insurance \nThe DIF provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 per depositor, and is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions, based on the risk each institution poses to the DIF. The Bank accepts customer deposits that are insured by the DIF and, therefore, must pay insurance premiums. The FDIC may increase the Bank’s insurance premiums based on various factors, including the FDIC’s assessment of its risk profile. \nThe FDIC also requires large insured depository institutions, including the Bank, to maintain enhanced deposit account recordkeeping and related information technology system capabilities to facilitate prompt payment of insured deposits if such an institution were to fail. \nThe FDIC, as required under the FDIA, established a plan on September 15, 2020, to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35% within eight years. This plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate. Based on the FDIC’s recent projections, however, the FDIC determined that the DIF reserve ratio is at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028 without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rates. In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, beginning on January 1, 2023. The FDIC also concurrently maintained the Designated Reserve Ratio for the DIF at 2%.\nIn November 2023, the FDIC issued a final rule, which became effective April 1, 2024, to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the DIF associated with the first half 2023 bank failures. Under the final rule, the assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an insured depository institution’s estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion of uninsured deposits. The FDIC will collect the special assessment over an initial eight-quarter collection period, which began in the second quarter of 2024 and currently projects that the special assessment will be collected for an additional two quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period, at a lower rate, subject to change depending on any adjustments to the loss estimate, mergers or failures, or amendments to reported estimates of uninsured deposits. The Bank recognized expense of $214 million in 2023 and $28 million in 2024 related to the DIF special assessment.\nCompensation \nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees, by other financial regulatory bodies. The scope and content of compensation regulation in the financial industry are continuing to develop, and we expect that these regulations and resulting market practices will continue to evolve over a number of years. \nThe federal bank regulatory agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations, such as Huntington and the Bank, do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. The SEC has a rule that directs stock exchanges to require listed companies to implement clawback policies to recover incentive-based compensation from current or former executive officers in the event of certain financial restatements and requires companies to disclose their clawback policies and their actions under those policies. \n2024 Form 10-K     \n21\nTable of \nContents\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and soundness practices. The relevant federal bank regulatory agency, the OCC in the Bank’s case, examines each bank and assigns it a public CRA rating. A bank’s record of fair lending compliance is part of the resulting CRA examination report.\nThe CRA requires the relevant federal bank regulatory agency to consider a bank’s CRA assessment when considering the bank’s application to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions or to open or relocate a branch office. The Federal Reserve also must consider the CRA record of each subsidiary bank of a BHC in connection with any acquisition or merger application filed by the BHC. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay or result in the denial of an approval or application by Huntington or the Bank. The Bank received the highest possible overall CRA rating of “Outstanding” in its most recent examination.\nIn October 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule to amend their regulations implementing the CRA. The rule materially revises the current CRA framework, including the assessment areas in which a bank is evaluated to include activities associated with online and mobile banking, the tests used to evaluate the Bank in its assessment areas, new methods of calculating credit for lending, investment, and service activities, and additional data collection and reporting requirements. The rule is expected to result in a significant increase in the thresholds for large banks to receive “Outstanding” ratings in the future. The rule was expected to take effect on April 1, 2024, with most of its provisions becoming applicable on January 1, 2026. Reporting of the collected data will not be required until 2027. Several banking industry groups filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the CRA final rule, in which they argued that the federal banking agencies exceeded their statutory authority in adopting the CRA final rule. In March 2024, a federal judge granted an injunction to extend the CRA final rule’s effective date, originally set for April 1, 2024. The effective date will be extended each day the injunction remains in place, pending the resolution of the lawsuit. \nDebit Interchange Fees\nWe are subject to a statutory requirement that interchange fees for electronic debit transactions that are paid to or charged by payment card issuers, including the Bank, be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer. Interchange fees for electronic debit transactions are limited to 21 cents plus 0.05% of the transaction, plus an additional one cent per transaction fraud adjustment. These fees impose requirements regarding routing and exclusivity of electronic debit transactions. As an issuer with over $10 billion in assets, Huntington is subject to, and in compliance with, Regulation II which requires, among other things, that debit card issuers should enable all debit card transactions, including card-not-present transactions such as online payments, to be processed on at least two unaffiliated payment card networks. \nIn October 2023, the Federal Reserve released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would lower the maximum interchange fee that a large debit card issuer can receive on a debit card transaction. Under the proposal, the base component would initially decrease from 21.0 cents to 14.4 cents, the \nad valorem\n component would decrease from 5.0 basis points to 4.0 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, and the fraud-prevention adjustment would increase from 1.0 cents to 1.3 cents for debit card transactions performed from the effective date of the final rule to June 30, 2025. In addition, the proposal would adopt an approach for future adjustments to the interchange fee cap, which would occur every other year based on issuer cost data gathered from large debit card issuers.\nConsumer Protection Regulation and Supervision\nWe are subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws. We are also subject to certain state consumer protection laws, and under the Dodd-Frank Act, state attorneys general and other state officials are empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations. State authorities have increased their focus on and enforcement of consumer protection rules. These federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of our activities and to various aspects of our business and include laws relating to interest rates, fair lending, disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers, debt collection practices, the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies, and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale, or provision of consumer financial products and services.\n22\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nIn December 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule that amends Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act, to apply to overdraft credit provided by insured depository institutions with more than $10 billion in total assets. The final rule is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2025. Under the final rule, covered institutions, including the Bank, would be allowed to choose to offer overdrafts as a courtesy overdraft service or as a line of credit. If the courtesy overdraft option is chosen, overdrafts would remain exempt from Regulation Z, as long as fees charged are based on the higher of an institutions breakeven point derived from its own costs and losses, or a benchmark fee of $5 established by the CFPB. If the overdraft line of credit option is chosen, overdrafts would be considered a loan subject to Regulation Z, and therefore, subject to account opening and loan disclosures, required to be held in an account separate from the customer’s checking or transaction account, and may not be conditioned on preauthorized electronic funds transfers. Several banking industry groups filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the final rule, in which they argued that the CFPB exceeded its statutory authority in adopting the final rule. The court has not yet ruled on the merits of the lawsuit nor granted a preliminary injunction. We continue to evaluate this rulemaking and assess its potential impact on Huntington and the Bank.\nCorporate Responsibility\nThe responsible way in which we operate our Company enables us to live Our Purpose of making people’s lives better, helping businesses thrive, and strengthening the communities we serve.

Our Community Plan was developed to support communities by enabling and improving financial opportunities for people, businesses, and neighborhoods through commitments focusing on increasing lending, investing, and services to address areas of need as follows: \n•\nHuntington committed to providing $24 billion in affordable housing financing and consumer lending. Through October 31, 2024, we have reached $18.2 billion of this commitment. \n•\nHuntington expanded its Small Business lending programs into its acquired TCF footprint and committed $10 billion to the programs. Through October 31, 2024, we have reached $8.2 billion of this commitment. \n•\nHuntington committed $6.5 billion in community development loans and investments to establish programs and services that foster equity in areas such as affordable housing, small business financing, and community services. Through October 31, 2024, we have exceeded this commitment by funding $7.8 billion in loans and investments. \n•\nEmbedded in the areas of need above is a $16 billion commitment to diverse borrowers and communities to advance systemic change. Through October 31, 2024, we have reached $14.7 billion of this commitment.\nHuntington has additionally developed a Lift Local Business® program, and made a commitment of $100 million, which supports entrepreneurs who have been historically under-resourced. This program offers loans, business planning support, free financial education courses delivered through Operation HOPE, and other services to help them achieve their goals. Through September 30, 2024, we have exceeded this commitment by funding $153 million in loans.\n24\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nEnvironmental\nHuntington supports environmental stewardship, reflecting our commitment to mitigating the effects of climate change and reducing our reliance on natural resources.

We value the feedback colleagues choose to share and use the information to drive our talent management program, which focuses on four key areas:\n•\nEngagement\n•\nDevelopment\n•\nRetention, and\n•\nAttraction of talent \nEngagement \nAt Huntington, we have taken steps to align our values, beliefs, and behaviors with those of our colleagues. We have highly engaged colleagues committed to looking out for each other and our customers with a balanced focus on “what we do” and “how we do it.” This synergy has proven to positively impact colleague performance and satisfaction. 2024 marked the tenth consecutive year we conducted a company-wide engagement survey to measure our colleagues’ experience with a strategic focus on culture, trust, and engagement – and the results were reaffirming. In 2024, 85%, 82%, and 82% of colleagues responded favorably on trust, culture, and engagement, respectively. These results place Huntington in the top quartile of favorability for Culture and Trust among our benchmark peer group. 80% of colleagues responded they would recommend Huntington as a great place to work. \nThe annual company-wide engagement survey is just one element of our continual colleague feedback program, which includes quick colleague pulse, new hire, manager-specific, and exit surveys. These surveys enhance leader understanding of the colleague experience, position Huntington to respond to colleague needs, and provide strong support to colleagues as they deliver performance in the spirit of our Purpose and Values.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n25\nTable of \nContents\nAt Huntington, living our shared Purpose extends beyond our daily work. We believe that building connections between colleagues, their families and our communities create a meaningful, fulfilling, and inclusive colleague experience. During 2024, Huntington colleagues provided approximately 35,000 volunteer hours to nearly 1,400 organizations across our footprint, including foodbanks, homeless shelters, local schools, senior housing, and afterschool programs. \nDevelopment \nWe have created specialized programs to help our colleagues grow and develop. These programs include an online library which allows colleagues to take ownership of their development via direct access to role-based content. The content is divided into three key areas of development: learning and growth, maximizing performance, and protecting the company. During 2024, colleagues at Huntington completed nearly 800,000 training hours. Huntington also provided several top talent development programs so that colleagues may further develop and accelerate their career growth. Additionally, we offer our full-time colleagues the ability to obtain post-secondary education with reimbursement of eligible tuition, including through two arrangements where tuition is reimbursed in advance. In addition to these programs, Huntington has also launched a program to capture the skills of all colleagues and match colleagues to internal job opportunities based on those skills. \nRetention\nHuntington is committed to creating an environment where colleagues are valued, supported, and empowered. With respect to pay, Huntington offers a minimum hourly rate of $20 per hour and competitive wages at all levels of the organization, which we regularly benchmark against the marketplace. Our compensation structure includes benefit plans and programs focused on multiple facets of well-being, including physical, mental, and financial wellness. We also offer Workplace Flex, a program designed to help colleagues to achieve a healthy balance between work and life outside of work. The program includes, when available and appropriate: flexible scheduling (staggered hours, compressed workweeks, part-time schedules, and job-sharing), flexible work location (remote and in-office), and both health and financial wellness support beyond the basic medical/visual/dental programs (adoption and fertility, parental leave, on-site fitness and fitness discounts, mental health and financial counseling services, support for chronic conditions). \nWe continue to identify and implement effective practices to promote pay equity, in compliance with laws. Huntington conducts a pay equity analysis annually, evaluating pay for colleagues performing the same work, designed to ensure equity.\nThe diversity of our colleagues is a key component of our success as an organization as it allows us to have a workforce that is representative of the communities we serve and is critical to our sustained success and growth. \nOur commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive environment involves embracing different skills, backgrounds, and perspectives, both in our communities and at work. We execute this strategy in multiple ways, including community engagement and through Inclusion Councils, Business Resource Groups, and Communities of Practice to support our commitment to engage, develop, retain, and attract talent.\nCollectively, these strategies create a colleague experience that entices colleagues to stay and fulfill their goals with Huntington. \nAttraction of Talent\n \nWe are dedicated to attracting highly talented colleagues and becoming a destination employer. We embrace a talent attraction model that supports our mission to provide every candidate and hiring manager with an exceptional experience that aligns with our people-first culture. Our Purpose Driven Hiring process is integrated into our leadership development program, which is designed for new leaders within their first 90 days of employment. Purpose Driven Hiring supports our approach to hiring for alignment with Huntington’s leadership behaviors, values, and skills, creating a streamlined, repeatable process that promotes fair treatment for all. We have made investments, including revamping our career site and leveraging a candidate management platform, to enhance communication that elevate the hiring experience for candidates, hiring managers, and recruiters alike. These practices will allow us to secure highly talented colleagues that will help shape our future.\n26\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nAvailable Information\nWe are subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and, in accordance with the Exchange Act, we file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC.

The sale of our RPS business resulted in a $57 million gain recorded within other noninterest income.\nIn June 2022, Huntington completed the acquisition of Capstone Partners, a top tier middle market investment bank and advisory firm. The transaction brought a national scale to serve middle market business owners throughout the corporate lifecycle, building on Huntington’s regional banking foundation. Capstone Partners related revenue, including mergers and acquisitions, capital raising, and other advisory-related fees, is recognized within capital markets and advisory fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. \nIn May 2022, Huntington completed the acquisition of Digital Payments Torana, Inc., now known as Huntington ChoicePay, a digital payments business focused on business to consumer payments. This acquisition, along with the formation of our enterprise-wide payments group, reflects one of our strategic priorities to accelerate our payments capabilities and expand the services provided to our customers.\nReporting Update\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, Huntington updated the presentation of our reported deposit categories to align more closely with how we strategically manage our business. As a result, we now report our deposit composition in the following categories: (1) demand deposits - noninterest bearing, (2) demand deposits - interest bearing, (3) money market, (4) savings, and (5) time deposits. Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.\n46\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\n2024 Financial Performance Review\nSelected Financial Data\nTable 1 - Selected Year to Date Income Statement Data\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n \nChange from 2023\n \nChange from 2022\n \n(amounts in millions, except per share data)\n2024\nAmount\nPercent\n2023\nAmount\nPercent\n2022\nInterest income\n$\n9,921\n$\n1,005 \n11 \n%\n$\n8,916\n$\n2,947 \n49 \n%\n$\n5,969\nInterest expense\n4,576\n1,099 \n32 \n3,477\n2,781 \n400 \n696\nNet interest income\n5,345\n(94)\n(2)\n5,439\n166 \n3 \n5,273\nProvision for credit losses\n420\n18 \n4 \n402\n113 \n39\n289\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses\n4,925\n(112)\n(2)\n5,037\n53 \n1 \n4,984\nNoninterest income\n2,040\n119 \n6 \n1,921\n(60)\n(3)\n1,981\nNoninterest expense\n4,562\n(12)\n— \n4,574\n373 \n9 \n4,201\nIncome before income taxes\n2,403\n19 \n1 \n2,384\n(380)\n(14)\n2,764\nProvision for income taxes\n443\n30 \n7 \n413\n(102)\n(20)\n515\nIncome after income taxes\n1,960\n(11)\n(1)\n1,971\n(278)\n(12)\n2,249\nIncome attributable to non-controlling interest\n20\n— \n— \n20\n9 \n82\n11\nNet income attributable to Huntington\n1,940\n(11)\n(1)\n1,951\n(287)\n(13)\n2,238\nDividends on preferred shares\n134\n(8)\n(6)\n142\n29 \n26 \n113\nImpact of preferred stock redemptions and repurchases\n5\n13 \nNM\n(8)\n(8)\nNM\n— \nNet income applicable to common shares\n$\n1,801\n$\n(16)\n(1)\n%\n$\n1,817\n$\n(308)\n(14)\n%\n$\n2,125\nAverage common shares—basic\n1,451\n5 \n— \n%\n1,446\n5 \n— \n%\n1,441\nAverage common shares—diluted\n1,476\n8 \n1 \n1,468\n3 \n— \n1,465\nNet income per common share—basic\n$\n1.24\n$\n(0.02)\n(2)\n$\n1.26\n$\n(0.21)\n(14)\n$\n1.47\nNet income per common share—diluted\n1.22\n(0.02)\n(2)\n1.24\n(0.21)\n(14)\n1.45\nCash dividends declared\n0.62\n— \n— \n0.62\n— \n— \n0.62\nReturn on average total assets\n0.99 \n%\n1.04 \n%\n1.25 \n%\nReturn on average common shareholders’ equity\n10.4\n11.2\n13.2\nReturn on average tangible common shareholders’ equity (1)\n15.7\n17.6\n20.7\nNet interest margin (2)\n3.00\n3.19\n3.25\nEfficiency ratio (3)\n60.5\n61.0\n56.9\nRevenue and Net Interest Income—FTE (Non-GAAP)\nNet interest income\n$\n5,345\n$\n(94)\n(2)\n%\n$\n5,439\n$\n166 \n3 \n%\n$\n5,273\nFTE adjustment (2)\n53\n11 \n26 \n42\n11 \n35 \n31\nNet interest income, FTE (non-GAAP)(2)\n5,398\n(83)\n(2)\n5,481\n177 \n3 \n5,304\nNoninterest income\n2,040\n119 \n6 \n1,921\n(60)\n(3)\n1,981\nTotal revenue, FTE (non-GAAP)(2)\n$\n7,438\n$\n36 \n— \n%\n$\n7,402\n$\n117 \n2 \n%\n$\n7,285\n(1)    Net income applicable to common shares excluding expense for amortization of intangibles for the period divided by average tangible common shareholders’ equity.

The current year reported net income was negatively impacted by additional expense attributable to the FDIC DIF special assessment totaling $28 million, or $23 million after tax ($0.02 per common share), and $20 million, or $16 million after tax ($0.01 per common share), of expense from staffing efficiencies and corporate real estate consolidation expense. The prior year’s reported net income was negatively impacted by the initial recognition of the FDIC DIF special assessment totaling $214 million, or $169 million after tax ($0.11 per common share), and $69 million, or $55 million after tax ($0.04 per common share), of expense from staffing efficiencies and corporate real estate consolidation expense.\nNet interest income was $5.3 billion in 2024, a decrease of $94 million, or 2%, from 2023. FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, decreased $83 million, or 2%, from 2023. The decrease in FTE net interest income reflected a 19 basis point decrease in the FTE NIM to 3.00% and a $12.2 billion, or 9%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a $8.2 billion, or 5%, increase in average earning assets. The NIM compression was primarily due to the higher rate environment driving a higher cost of funds, partially offset by an increase in loans and leases and investment security yields.\nThe provision for credit losses increased $18 million, or 4%, to $420 million for 2024. The ACL was $2.4 billion, or 1.88% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2024, compared to $2.4 billion, or 1.97% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2023. The modest increase in the total ACL was driven by a combination of loan and lease growth and increased net charge off activity in 2024, mostly offset by a decrease in the overall coverage ratios in 2024 that is reflective of the current macroeconomic environment. \nNoninterest income of $2.0 billion, increased $119 million, or 6%, from the prior year, primarily due to increases in capital markets and advisory fees, wealth and asset management revenue, payments and cash management revenue, customer deposit and loan fees, and mortgage banking income, and $24 million of unfavorable mark-to-market on the pay-fixed swaptions program recognized in 2023, partially offset by a decrease in leasing revenue and a $57 million gain on the sale of our RPS business recognized in 2023. Noninterest expense of $4.6 billion, decreased $12 million from the prior year primarily due to a reduction in the FDIC DIF special assessment of $186 million and lower staffing efficiencies and corporate real estate consolidation expense, partially offset by current year increases in personnel expense and outside data processing and other services. \nConsolidated Balance Sheet and Capital Ratios\nTotal assets at December 31, 2024 were $204.2 billion, an increase of $14.9 billion, or 8%, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was primarily driven by increases in loans and leases of $8.1 billion, or 7%, interest-earning deposits with banks of $2.9 billion, or 33%, and total securities of $2.6 billion, or 6%. Total liabilities at December 31, 2024 were $184.4 billion, an increase of $14.5 billion, or 9%, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total liabilities was primarily driven by increases in total deposits of $11.2 billion, or 7%, and long-term debt of $4.0 billion, or 32%.\nThe tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.1% at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with an increase in tangible common equity offset by an increase in tangible assets. The CET1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.5% at December 31, 2024, up from 10.2% at December 31, 2023. The increase in CET1 was primarily due to current period earnings, net of dividends, partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets and a reduction in the CECL transitional amount. The increase in risk-weighted assets was driven by loan growth, partially offset by the capital benefit of two CLN transactions completed during 2024. \n48\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nBusiness Overview\nGeneral\nOur general business objectives are to: \n•\nDeliver our Culture, Purpose, and Vision through a Differentiated Operating Model;\n•\nBuild on our vision to be the leading People-First, Customer-Centered bank in the country;\n•\nDeliver top quartile performance through sustainable long-term profitable growth;\n•\nDifferentiate our culture, brand, and customer experience through expanded product offerings to drive digital acquisition, deepening, and retention, and leveraging partnerships and technology to grow customers and market share;\n•\nLeverage our regional banking model and national franchise to drive scale, growth and expansion;\n•\nAnticipate evolving customer needs to drive profitable growth;\n•\nMaintain positive operating leverage and execute disciplined capital management; and\n•\nProvide stability and resilience through disciplined risk management, while maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. \nOur 2024 results reflect strong organic growth, across both loans and deposits, supported by the combination of existing and new businesses.\n \nDriven by our strong liquidity, capital, and credit, we invested in building existing business relationships, while expanding capabilities and expertise through both geographic expansion and the addition of new commercial verticals. Credit continues to perform well, consistent with our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. We remain focused on delivering profitable growth and driving value for our shareholders, and believe Huntington is positioned to perform well through the dynamic environment.\nEconomy \nThe rate cutting cycle began in 2024, with a September 50 basis point cut and two fourth quarter 25 basis point cuts, bringing the cumulative amount of rate cuts to 100 basis points since the September FOMC meeting. Inflation is still not within the Federal Reserve’s 2% target and has recently stopped trending lower. Employment data has stabilized after showing notable deterioration in early and mid-2024. The unemployment rate started the year at 3.8% and ended at 4.1%, holding relatively flat throughout the second half of 2024. Taking these factors into consideration, recent commentary from Federal Reserve members has been more neutral and suggesting it may be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates at current levels, with limited rate cuts expected in 2025.\nRecent economic data has been mixed. The services sector continues to expand and prices paid for services remains high, which has been the main driver to overall inflation remaining elevated. Retail sales have held up well, while manufacturing remains weak and is generally still slowly contracting. Expectations are for the economy to hold up well for the first half of 2025, with more risks of a potential slowdown in the back half of the year. \nLegislative and Regulatory\nA comprehensive discussion of legislative and regulatory matters affecting us can be found in Item 1: Business - “\nRegulatory Matters\n” section of this Form 10-K. \n2024 Form 10-K     \n49\nTable of \nContents\nDISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section provides a review of financial performance on a consolidated basis. Key consolidated balance sheet and income statement trends are discussed. All earnings per share data are reported on a diluted basis. For additional insight on financial performance, please read this section in conjunction with the “\nBusiness Segment Discussion\n.”\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for 2023 versus 2022, see “Part II, Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” Discussion of Results of Operations included in our 2023 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024. \nAverage Balance Sheet / Net Interest Income\nOur primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from earning assets (primarily loans and leases and securities), and interest expense from funding sources (primarily interest-bearing deposits and borrowings). Earning asset balances and related funding sources, as well as changes in the levels of interest rates, impact net interest income. The difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities is the net interest spread. Noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders’ equity, also support earning assets. The impact of the noninterest-bearing sources of funds, often referred to as “free” funds, is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. Both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on an FTE basis, which means that tax-free interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income, assuming a 21% tax rate. Information related to major components of our net interest income (FTE) and related yields are presented on the following table.\n50\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nTable 2 - Consolidated Average Balance Sheet and Net Interest Margin Analysis\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nAverage\nInterest Income/Expense\nYield/\nAverage\nInterest Income/ Expense\nYield/\nChange in Average Balances\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nBalances\n(FTE) (1)\nRate (2)\nBalances\n(FTE) (1)\nRate (2)\nAmount\nPercent\nAssets:\nInterest-earning deposits with banks\n$\n11,113 \n$\n598 \n5.38 \n%\n$\n9,309 \n$\n492 \n5.30 \n%\n$\n1,804 \n19 \n%\nSecurities:\nTrading account securities\n265 \n13 \n5.04 \n77 \n4 \n5.14 \n188 \n244 \nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nTaxable\n24,232 \n1,251 \n5.16 \n20,539 \n1,016 \n4.95 \n3,693 \n18 \nTax-exempt\n2,779 \n141 \n5.08 \n2,720 \n132 \n4.84 \n59 \n2 \nTotal available-for-sale securities\n27,011 \n1,392 \n5.15 \n23,259 \n1,148 \n4.93 \n3,752 \n16 \nHeld-to-maturity securities—taxable\n15,478 \n385 \n2.49 \n16,507 \n401 \n2.43 \n(1,029)\n(6)\nOther securities\n789 \n42 \n5.33 \n933 \n53 \n5.70 \n(144)\n(15)\nTotal securities\n43,543 \n1,832 \n4.21 \n40,776 \n1,606 \n3.94 \n2,767 \n7 \nLoans held for sale\n597 \n40 \n6.63 \n554 \n35 \n6.34 \n43 \n8 \nLoans and leases: (3)\nCommercial:\nCommercial and industrial\n52,426 \n3,321 \n6.33 \n49,640 \n2,991 \n6.03 \n2,786 \n6 \nCommercial real estate\n11,935 \n907 \n7.60 \n13,140 \n972 \n7.40 \n(1,205)\n(9)\nLease financing\n5,190 \n336 \n6.47 \n5,128 \n289 \n5.63 \n62 \n1 \nTotal commercial\n69,551 \n4,564 \n6.56 \n67,908 \n4,252 \n6.26 \n1,643 \n2 \nConsumer:\nResidential mortgage\n23,956 \n943 \n3.94 \n22,990 \n825 \n3.59 \n966 \n4 \nAutomobile\n13,372 \n726 \n5.43 \n12,881 \n561 \n4.36 \n491 \n4 \nHome equity\n10,088 \n780 \n7.73 \n10,156 \n760 \n7.48 \n(68)\n(1)\nRV and marine\n5,979 \n310 \n5.19 \n5,650 \n271 \n4.79 \n329 \n6 \nOther consumer\n1,557 \n181 \n11.61 \n1,362 \n156 \n11.53 \n195 \n14 \nTotal consumer\n54,952 \n2,940 \n5.35 \n53,039 \n2,573 \n4.85 \n1,913 \n4 \nTotal loans and leases\n124,503 \n7,504 \n6.03 \n120,947 \n6,825 \n5.64 \n3,556 \n3 \nTotal earning assets\n179,756 \n9,974 \n5.55 \n171,586 \n8,958 \n5.22 \n8,170 \n5 \nCash and due from banks\n1,397 \n1,576 \n(179)\n(11)\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\n5,680 \n5,731 \n(51)\n(1)\nAll other assets\n9,427 \n8,663 \n764 \n9 \nTotal assets\n$\n196,260 \n$\n187,556 \n$\n8,704 \n5 \n%\nLiabilities and Shareholders’ Equity:\nInterest-bearing deposits:\nDemand deposits—interest-bearing\n$\n40,401 \n$\n858 \n2.12 \n%\n$\n39,901 \n$\n703 \n1.76 \n%\n$\n500 \n1 \n%\nMoney market deposits\n54,702 \n1,994 \n3.64 \n44,958 \n1,365 \n3.04 \n9,744 \n22 \nSavings deposits\n15,141 \n15 \n0.10 \n17,502 \n3 \n0.02 \n(2,361)\n(13)\nTime deposits\n15,343 \n705 \n4.60 \n11,042 \n426 \n3.86 \n4,301 \n39 \nTotal interest-bearing deposits\n125,587 \n3,572 \n2.84 \n113,403 \n2,497 \n2.20 \n12,184 \n11 \nShort-term borrowings\n1,147 \n69 \n5.99 \n3,081 \n179 \n5.81 \n(1,934)\n(63)\nLong-term debt\n15,224 \n935 \n6.14 \n13,324 \n801 \n6.01 \n1,900 \n14 \nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n141,958 \n4,576 \n3.22 \n129,808 \n3,477 \n2.68 \n12,150 \n9 \nDemand deposits—noninterest-bearing\n29,479 \n33,985 \n(4,506)\n(13)\nAll other liabilities\n5,123 \n5,080 \n43 \n1 \nTotal liabilities\n176,560 \n168,873 \n7,687 \n5 \nTotal Huntington shareholders’ equity\n19,651 \n18,634 \n1,017 \n5 \nNon-controlling interest\n49 \n49 \n— \n—\nTotal equity\n19,700 \n18,683 \n1,017 \n5 \nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n196,260 \n$\n187,556 \n$\n8,704 \n5 \n%\nNet interest rate spread\n2.33 \n2.54 \nImpact of noninterest-bearing funds on NIM\n0.67 \n0.65 \nNII/NIM (FTE)\n$\n5,398 \n3.00 \n%\n$\n5,481 \n3.19 \n%\n(1)\nFTE yields are calculated assuming a 21% tax rate.\n(2)\nYield/rates include the impact of applicable derivatives.

FTE net interest income, a non-GAAP financial measure, decreased $83 million, or 2%, from 2023. The decrease in FTE net interest income reflected a 19 basis point decrease in the FTE NIM to 3.00% and a $12.2 billion, or 9%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a $8.2 billion, or 5%, increase in average earning assets. The NIM compression was primarily due to the higher rate environment driving a higher cost of funds, partially offset by an increase in loans and leases and investment security yields.\nAverage Balance Sheet\nAverage assets for 2024 were $196.3 billion, an increase of $8.7 billion, or 5%, from 2023, primarily due to an increase in average loans and leases of $3.6 billion, or 3%, total securities of $2.8 billion, or 7%, and interest-earning deposits with banks of $1.8 billion, or 19%. The increase in average loans and leases included growth in average consumer loans of $1.9 billion, or 4%, and average commercial loans and leases of $1.6 billion, or 2%.\nAverage liabilities for 2024 were $176.6 billion, an increase of $7.7 billion, or 5%, from 2023, primarily due to an increase in average deposits of $7.7 billion, or 5%, driven by an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $12.2 billion, or 11%, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits of $4.5 billion, or 13%. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits was driven by increases in average money market deposits and time deposits, partially offset by a decrease in average savings deposits.\nAverage shareholders’ equity for 2024 was $19.7 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 5%, from 2023, primarily due to earnings, net of dividends, and the benefit from a decrease in average accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nProvision for Credit Losses\n(This section should be read in conjunction with the “\nCredit Risk\n” section.)\nThe provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ACL at levels appropriate to absorb our estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio, securities portfolio, and unfunded lending commitments.\nThe provision for credit losses in 2024 was $420 million, an increase of $18 million, or 4%, from 2023. The increase in provision expense over the prior year was driven by a combination of current year loan and lease growth and increased net charge off activity in 2024. These increases were largely offset by a modest reduction in overall coverage ratios in 2024 that is reflective of the current macroeconomic environment.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n53\nTable of \nContents\nThe following table presents components of the provision for credit losses.\nTable 4 - Provision for Credit Losses\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nProvision for loan and lease losses\n$\n361 \n$\n407 \n$\n212 \nProvision (benefit) for unfunded lending commitments\n57 \n(5)\n73 \nProvision for securities\n2 \n— \n4 \nTotal provision for credit losses\n$\n420 \n$\n402 \n$\n289 \nNoninterest Income\nThe following table reflects noninterest income for each of the periods presented. \nTable 5 - Noninterest Income\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nChange from 2023\n \nChange from 2022\n \n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\nAmount\nPercent\n2023\nAmount\nPercent\n2022\nPayments and cash management revenue\n$\n620 \n$\n35 \n6 \n%\n$\n585 \n$\n24 \n4 \n%\n$\n561 \nWealth and asset management revenue\n364 \n36 \n11 \n328 \n28 \n9 \n300 \nCustomer deposit and loan fees\n334 \n22 \n7 \n312 \n(38)\n(11)\n350 \nCapital markets and advisory fees\n327 \n79 \n32 \n248 \n(17)\n(6)\n265 \nMortgage banking income\n130 \n21 \n19 \n109 \n(35)\n(24)\n144 \nLeasing revenue\n79 \n(33)\n(29)\n112 \n(14)\n(11)\n126 \nInsurance income\n77 \n3 \n4 \n74 \n(5)\n(6)\n79 \nNet gains (losses) on sales of securities\n(21)\n(14)\n NM\n(7)\n(7)\nNM\n— \nOther noninterest income\n130 \n(30)\n(19)\n160 \n4 \n3 \n156 \nTotal noninterest income\n$\n2,040 \n$\n119 \n6 \n%\n$\n1,921 \n$\n(60)\n(3)\n%\n$\n1,981 \nNoninterest income was $2.0 billion, an increase of $119 million, or 6%, from the prior year. Capital markets and advisory fees increased $79 million, or 32%, primarily due to higher advisory and underwriting fees. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $36 million, or 11%, reflecting an increase in assets under management. Payments and cash management revenue increased $35 million, or 6%, reflecting higher card and merchant acquiring transaction revenue. Customer deposit and loan fees increased $22 million, or 7%, primarily reflecting higher deposit fees. Mortgage banking income increased $21 million, or 19%, largely reflecting an increase in saleable spreads. Partially offsetting these increases, leasing revenue decreased $33 million, or 29%, driven by lower income on terminated leases and operating lease income. Other noninterest income decreased $30 million, or 19%, primarily due to items recognized in 2023, including a $57 million gain on the sale of our RPS business and $24 million of unfavorable mark-to-market on the pay-fixed swaptions program.\n54\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table reflects noninterest expense for each of the periods presented. \nTable 6 - Noninterest Expense\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \nChange from 2023\n \nChange from 2022\n \n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\nAmount\nPercent\n2023\nAmount\nPercent\n2022\nPersonnel costs\n$\n2,701 \n$\n172 \n7 \n%\n$\n2,529 \n$\n128 \n5 \n%\n$\n2,401 \nOutside data processing and other services\n665 \n60 \n10 \n605 \n(5)\n(1)\n610 \nEquipment\n267 \n4 \n2\n263 \n(6)\n(2)\n269 \nNet occupancy\n221 \n(25)\n(10)\n246 \n— \n— \n246 \nMarketing\n116 \n1 \n1 \n115 \n24 \n26 \n91 \nDeposit and other insurance expense\n114 \n(188)\n(62)\n302 \n235 \n   NM\n67 \nProfessional services\n99 \n— \n— \n99 \n22 \n29 \n77 \nAmortization of intangibles\n47 \n(3)\n(6)\n50 \n(3)\n(6)\n53 \nLease financing equipment depreciation\n15 \n(12)\n(44)\n27 \n(18)\n(40)\n45 \nOther noninterest expense\n317 \n(21)\n(6)\n338 \n(4)\n(1)\n342 \nTotal noninterest expense\n$\n4,562 \n$\n(12)\n— \n%\n$\n4,574 \n$\n373 \n9 \n%\n$\n4,201 \nNumber of employees (average full-time equivalent)\n19,932 \n(23)\n— \n%\n19,955 \n35 \n— \n%\n19,920 \nNoninterest expense was $4.6 billion, a decrease of $12 million from the prior year. Deposit and other insurance expense decreased $188 million, or 62%, primarily due to a reduction in the FDIC DIF special assessment. The FDIC DIF special assessment expense was $28 million in 2024, compared to $214 million in 2023. Net occupancy decreased $25 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher corporate real estate and branch consolidation expenses recognized in the prior year. Other noninterest expense decreased $21 million, or 6%, largely due to lower franchise and other taxes. Partially offsetting these decreases, personnel costs increased $172 million, or 7%, primarily due to increases in salary, incentive compensation, and benefit expense, partially offset by a $33 million decrease in severance expense related to staffing efficiencies. Outside data processing and other services increased $60 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher technology and data expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 1 - “\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n” and Note 17 - “\nIncome Taxes\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nThe provision for income taxes was $443 million for 2024, compared with $413 million in 2023. The effective tax rates for 2024 and 2023 were 18.4% and 17.3%, respectively. Both years included the benefits from general business credits, tax-exempt income, tax-exempt bank owned life insurance income, and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2024, compared to 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefits associated with qualified affordable housing projects and lower tax benefits from discrete items. \nThe net federal deferred tax asset was $684 million, and the net state deferred tax asset was $109 million at December 31, 2024.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk Management Structure\nOur risk management program is structured using three lines of defense, each of which is independent of the others: \n•\nFirst-line consists of business segments engaged in activities designed to generate revenue or reduce expenses, provide operational support or technology services, or deliver products or services to customers.\n•\nSecond-line is Corporate Risk Management.\n•\nThird-line consists of Internal Audit and Credit Review. \n2024 Form 10-K     \n55\nTable of \nContents\nSegment Risk Officers are embedded in the first-line and report directly to business unit senior management and indirectly to the Chief Risk Officer. They identify and monitor risk, elevate and remediate issues, establish controls, perform testing, and oversee the self-assessment process. Second-line Corporate Risk Management oversees first-line risk-taking activity, establishes policies, sets operating limits, reviews new or modified products and processes, and is responsible for producing an independent assessment of the Company’s risk position relative to the Board’s risk appetite. Third-line Internal Audit and Credit Review provide additional assurance that risk-related functions are operating as intended.\nRisk Governance and Risk Appetite\nOur Risk Governance Framework and Risk Appetite Statement are foundational to the risk management program. The Risk Governance Framework defines the three lines of defense structure, roles, responsibilities, and requirements. The Risk Appetite Statement is approved by our Board and defines the level and types of risks we are willing to assume to achieve our corporate objectives through defined risk limits for the seven key risk categories to which we are exposed:\n•\nCredit risk\n, which is risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms. \n•\nMarket risk\n, which includes interest rate and price risk. Interest rate is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from movements in interest rates and considers reprice risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and options risk. Price risk results from changes in the value of either trading portfolios or other obligations that are entered into as part of distributing risk, primarily associated with market making, dealing, and position taking in interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodities, and credit markets. \n•\nLiquidity risk\n, which is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability, or perceived inability, to meet obligations when they come due, and includes the inability to access funding sources, manage fluctuations in funding levels, or failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the Company’s ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value.\n•\nOperational risk\n, which is the risk of loss and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, models, data, human error or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational losses can result from internal fraud, external fraud, inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety, failure to meet obligations involving customers, products, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and systems failures, and failures in execution, delivery, and process management. \n•\nCompliance risk\n, which is risk arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance with laws, regulations, prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or ethical standards, and can expose the Company to fines, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and voiding of contracts.\n•\nStrategic risk\n, which is risk arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment, and is a function of the Company’s strategic goals, business strategies, resources, and quality of implementation.\n•\nReputation risk\n, which is risk arising from negative public opinion that may impair the Company’s competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services or continue servicing existing relationships. \nThe Board has defined our risk appetite as aggregate moderate-to-low on a through-the-cycle basis. While we engage in a limited amount of higher risk activity consistent with our strategic objectives, we ensure those positions are offset by lower risk positions. Our second-line Corporate Risk Management maintains and enforces risk limits established in our Risk Appetite Statement for each of our seven risk pillars, which helps ensure we achieve our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite objective. \nWe have a robust risk assessment process which includes qualitative and quantitative components that assess our inherent risk, control environment, and residual risk, and enables us to report to the Board if we are operating within the risk appetite. The process includes individual assessments from first-line business segments and independent second-line assessments for each risk pillar. These are combined to produce an overall Enterprise Risk Assessment that includes, among other things, top and emerging risks and a determination of whether the Company is operating within its risk appetite.\n56\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nWe have a broad range of controls that are factored into our assessments, including key controls, such as segregation of duties and access management, that are tested regularly. We also have robust authorization and reconciliation procedures, as well as staff education and a disciplined risk assessment process.\nBoard Oversight\nWhile the Board has three committees that primarily oversee implementation of the risk governance framework and risk appetite, the Risk Oversight Committee, Audit Committee, and Technology Committee, the full Board is engaged in discussing risks and monitoring our risk profile. All committees report their deliberations and actions at each full Board meeting. In addition, all scheduled committee meetings are open to all members of the Board, and committees regularly meet in joint sessions to discuss issues that are broadly applicable. Our Board has unfettered access to senior executive officers, and the Board and committees regularly meet in executive session without management present.\n•\nOur \nRisk Oversight Committee\n oversees implementation of the Risk Governance Framework and adherence to the Risk Appetite Statement, which takes the form of approving policies, frameworks, receiving regular reports, and engaging in discussion with Executive Management on topics for each of our risk pillars: credit, liquidity, market, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation risk. The ROC also oversees capital management and ensures the amount and quality of capital are adequate in relation to expected and unexpected losses. ROC oversees the administration, effectiveness, and independence of our Credit Review function, and the Credit Review Director reports directly to the ROC. Our Chief Risk Officer reports to both the ROC and CEO.\n•\nOur \nAudit Committee\n oversees integrity of our consolidated financial statements, including policies, procedures, and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements, the financial reporting process, disclosures, and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee oversees the Internal Audit department and the independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications and independence; compliance with our Financial Code of Ethics for the CEO and senior financial officers; compliance with corporate securities trading policies; compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and financial risk exposures in coordination with the ROC. Our Chief Auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee.\n•\nOur \nTechnology Committee\n oversees technology and cybersecurity strategies and plans and is charged with evaluating the Company’s capability to properly perform all technology functions necessary for its business plan, including projected growth, technology capacity, planning, operational execution, product development, and management capacity. It provides oversight of technology investments and plans to drive efficiency as well as to meet defined standards for risk, information security, and redundancy; oversees allocation of technology costs and ensures that they are understood by the Board; evaluates innovation and technology trends that may affect our strategic plans, including monitoring of overall industry trends; and reviews and provides oversight of our continuity and disaster recovery planning and preparedness.\nOverlapping or common topics are overseen by more than one committee. On a regular basis, the ROC and Audit Committee meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both committees’ responsibilities, including reviews of annual and quarterly filings, the methodology and level of the ACL, conduct risk, and others. These committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in both accounting and risk management. In addition, the ROC, Audit Committee, and Technology Committee oversee the effectiveness of management’s efforts to address risk issues in a timely, comprehensive, and sustainable manner, and regularly meet in in joint session to discuss. All directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directors.\nFurther, through our Human Resources and Compensation Committee, our Board seeks to ensure its overall compensation programs are balanced and align the interests of management, creditors, and shareholders. We utilize a variety of compensation-related tools to induce appropriate behavior, including common stock ownership thresholds for the CEO and certain members of senior management, equity deferrals, recoupment provisions, and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time. The Chief Risk Officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n57\nTable of \nContents\nOur Risk Governance structure also includes executive level committees to manage and oversee risk, which include Asset & Liability Management, Credit Policy & Strategy, Risk Management, Capital Management, Allowance, Incentive Compensation, Sarbanes-Oxley, and Disclosure Review. These committees are strategic in nature and are supported by subcommittees that are tactical. We believe this structure helps ensure appropriate escalation of issues, overall communication of strategies, and adherence to the Board’s risk appetite.\nA comprehensive discussion of risk management and capital matters affecting us can be found in the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A: \nRisk Factors\n and the “\nRegulatory Matters\n” section of Item 1: Business of this Form 10-K. \nSome of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit, market, liquidity, operational, and compliance risks are described in the following sections.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. We also have credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolios \n(see Note 3 - \"\nInvestment Securities and Other Securities\n\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)\n. We engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, mortgage banking, and trading activities. A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, swaptions, floors, forward contracts, and forward starting interest rate swaps, are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements. We also use derivatives, principally loan sale commitments, in hedging our mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale. Like other financial instruments, derivatives contain an element of credit risk, which is the possibility that we will incur a loss because the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations. Notional values of interest rate swaps and other off-balance sheet financial instruments significantly exceed the credit risk associated with these instruments and represent contractual balances on which calculations of amounts to be exchanged are based. Credit exposure is limited to the sum of the aggregate fair value of positions that have become favorable to us, including any accrued interest receivable due from counterparties. Potential credit losses are mitigated by derivatives through central clearing parties, careful evaluation of counterparty credit standing, selection of counterparties from a limited group of high quality institutions, collateral agreements, and other contract provisions. \nWe focus on the early identification, monitoring, and management of all aspects of our credit risk. In addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources, enhanced modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes. Our disciplined portfolio management processes are central to our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. In our efforts to identify risk mitigation techniques, we have focused on product design features, origination policies, and solutions for delinquent or stressed borrowers.\nThe maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. Authority to grant commitments sits with the independent credit administration function, with limited exceptions, and is closely monitored and regularly updated. Concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type, industry, and loan quality factors. We focus predominantly on extending credit to consumer and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets, although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives. Although we offer a broad set of products, we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities. Each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk portfolio profile.\n58\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nThe checks and balances in the credit process and the separation of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. For example, we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position.\nLoan and Lease Credit Exposure Mix\nAt December 31, 2024, our loans and leases totaled $130.0 billion, representing a $8.1 billion, or 7%, increase compared to $122.0 billion at December 31, 2023.\nThe table below provides the composition of our total loan and lease portfolio.\n \nTable 7 - Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition\nAt December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nCommercial:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n56,809 \n43 \n%\n$\n50,657 \n42 \n%\nCommercial real estate\n11,078 \n9 \n12,422 \n10 \nLease financing\n5,454 \n4 \n5,228 \n4 \nTotal commercial\n73,341 \n56 \n68,307 \n56 \nConsumer:\nResidential mortgage\n24,242 \n19 \n23,720 \n20 \nAutomobile\n14,564 \n11 \n12,482 \n10 \nHome equity\n10,142 \n8 \n10,113 \n8 \nRV and marine\n5,982 \n5 \n5,899 \n5 \nOther consumer\n1,771 \n1 \n1,461 \n1 \nTotal consumer\n56,701 \n44 \n53,675 \n44 \nTotal loans and leases\n$\n130,042 \n100 \n%\n$\n121,982 \n100 \n%\nThe following table reflects the composition and maturities of the loan and lease portfolio and the interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases due after one year. \nTable 8 - Maturity Schedule of Loans and Leases and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nLoans and Leases Due After 1 Year\nContractual Maturity Range\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nFixed Rate\nFloating or Adjustable Rate\nOne Year\nor Less\nOne to\nFive Years\nFive to\nFifteen Years\nAfter\nFifteen Years\nTotal\nAt December 31, 2024\nCommercial:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n11,498 \n$\n28,579 \n$\n16,732 \n$\n31,440 \n$\n7,461 \n$\n1,176 \n$\n56,809 \nCommercial real estate\n650 \n6,343 \n4,085 \n6,084 \n862 \n47 \n11,078 \nLease financing\n4,717 \n344 \n393 \n3,327 \n911 \n823 \n5,454 \nTotal commercial\n16,865 \n35,266 \n21,210 \n40,851 \n9,234 \n2,046 \n73,341 \nConsumer:\nResidential mortgage\n9,678 \n14,552 \n12 \n85 \n1,512 \n22,633 \n24,242 \nAutomobile\n14,397 \n— \n167 \n7,945 \n6,435 \n17 \n14,564 \nHome equity\n2,735 \n7,268 \n139 \n219 \n2,108 \n7,676 \n10,142 \nRV and marine\n5,980 \n— \n2 \n183 \n3,309 \n2,488 \n5,982 \nOther consumer\n755 \n624 \n392 \n1,111 \n231 \n37 \n1,771 \nTotal consumer\n33,545 \n22,444 \n712 \n9,543 \n13,595 \n32,851 \n56,701 \nTotal loans and leases\n$\n50,410 \n$\n57,710 \n$\n21,922 \n$\n50,394 \n$\n22,829 \n$\n34,897 \n$\n130,042 \nPercent of total\n17 \n%\n38 \n%\n18 \n%\n27 \n%\n100 \n%\n2024 Form 10-K     \n59\nTable of \nContents\nTotal commercial loans and leases were $73.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and represented 56% of our total loan and lease credit exposure at that date. Our commercial loan portfolio is diversified by product type, customer size, and geography, and is comprised of the following (\nsee Commercial Credit discussion)\n:\nC&I\n – C&I loans are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, or other projects, and to institutional sponsors supporting REITs. We focus on borrowers doing business within our geographic markets. C&I loans are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and/or the personal guarantee of the business owners. The financing of owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The operation, sale, rental, or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans. As we have expanded our C&I portfolio, we have developed a series of “vertical specialties” to ensure that new products or lending types are embedded within a structured, centralized Commercial Lending area with designated, experienced credit officers. These specialties are comprised of either targeted industries (for example, healthcare, technology & telecom, finance and insurance, etc.) and/or lending disciplines (equipment finance, distribution finance, asset-based lending, etc.), all of which requires a high degree of expertise and oversight to effectively mitigate and monitor risk. As such, we have dedicated colleagues and teams focused on bringing value-added expertise to these specialty customers. \nCRE\n – The CRE portfolio includes both CRE commercial and CRE construction loans. CRE commercial loans are loans to developers. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement. These loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers, and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale, or refinance of the property. Appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements and our credit policies. CRE construction loans are loans to developers, companies, or individuals used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property. Our CRE construction portfolio primarily consists of multi-family, retail, and warehouse property types. Generally, these loans are for construction projects that have been pre-sold or pre-leased, or have secured permanent financing, as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project. These loans are managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule.\nLease Financing \n– Lease financing products are designed to address the diverse financing needs of small to large companies primarily for the acquisition of equipment. Our lease financing portfolio will utilize a variety of origination partners and third-party sources including equipment manufacturers, dealers, or vendors set up under program structures to generate transactions from a nationwide footprint. High level business lines comprise of industrial finance, specialty finance, healthcare finance, technology finance, and specialized transportation, franchise, and government.\n60\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nTotal consumer loans were $56.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and represented 44% of our total loan and lease credit exposure at that date. The consumer portfolio is comprised primarily of residential mortgages, automobile loans, home equity loans and lines-of-credit, and RV and marine finance \n(see Consumer Credit discussion)\n.\nResidential mortgage\n – Residential mortgage loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. These loans are generally financed over a 15-year to 30-year term, and in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Applications are underwritten centrally using consistent credit policies and processes. All residential mortgage loan decisions utilize a full appraisal for collateral valuation. Huntington has not originated or acquired residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options.\nAutomobile\n – Automobile loans are comprised primarily of indirect loans made through automotive dealerships and include exposure in selected states outside of our primary banking markets. The exposure outside of our core footprint states represents 19% of the total exposure, with no individual state representing more than 6% of the total exposure. Applications are underwritten using an automated underwriting system that applies consistent policies and processes across the portfolio.\nHome equity\n – Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines-of-credit. This type of lending, which is secured by a first-lien or junior-lien on the borrower’s residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home or refinance existing mortgage debt. Products include closed-end loans which are generally fixed-rate with principal and interest payments, and variable-rate, interest-only lines-of-credit which do not require payment of principal during the 10-year revolving period. The home equity line of credit converts to a 20-year amortizing structure at the end of the revolving period. Applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system. The home equity underwriting criteria is based on minimum credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and LTV ratios, with current collateral valuations. The underwriting for the floating rate lines of credit also incorporates a stress analysis for rising interest rates.\nRV and marine \n– RV and marine includes loans provided to consumers primarily for the purpose of financing recreational vehicles and boats. Loans are originated on an indirect basis through a series of dealerships across 35 states. The loans are underwritten centrally using an application and decisioning system similar to automobile loans. The current portfolio includes 39% of the balances within our core footprint states.\nOther consumer\n – Other consumer loans primarily consist of consumer loans not included above, including credit cards, personal unsecured loans, and overdraft balances. We originate these products within our established set of credit policies and guidelines.\nOur loan and lease portfolio is a managed mix of consumer and commercial credits. We manage the overall credit exposure and portfolio composition via a credit concentration policy. The policy designates specific loan types, collateral types, and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned maximum exposure limits as a percentage of capital. Commercial lending by NAICS categories, specific limits for CRE project types, loans secured by residential real estate, large dollar exposures, and designated high risk loan categories represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process. There are no identified concentrations that exceed the assigned exposure limit. Our concentration management policy is approved by the ROC and is used to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. Changes to existing concentration limits, incorporating specific information relating to the potential impact on the overall portfolio composition and performance metrics, require the approval of the ROC prior to implementation. \n2024 Form 10-K     \n61\nTable of \nContents\nThe table below provides our total loan and lease portfolio segregated by industry type.

While these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. We require the signature approval of both the appropriate line of business leaders and independent credit executives. The risk rating, credit exposure amount, and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval. Credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority, with the exception of small business loans. For small business loans, we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures. In this centralized decision environment, certain individuals who understand each local region may make credit-extension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities in which we operate. In addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors, a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan.\n62\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nIn commercial lending, on-going credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan. We monitor all significant exposures. All commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrower’s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process. The PD is rated and applied at the borrower level. The LGD is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral. The internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event. There is also extensive macro-portfolio management analysis. We review and adjust our risk-rating criteria based on actual experience, which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio. A centralized portfolio management function monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio, including small business loans, to provide consistent oversight.\nIn addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process, our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and risk of new loan originations. This group is part of our Risk Management area and conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans, validate risk ratings, and test the consistency of credit processes.\nOur standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment, one of which is guarantor support. On an at least annual basis, we consider, among other things, the guarantor’s reputation and creditworthiness, where available, along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth. Our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength, or lack thereof, is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans, which is directly tied to, and an integral component of, our ACL methodology. When a loan goes to impaired status, viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of a credit loss.\nIf our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform, we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully. \nSubstantially all loans categorized as Classified \n(See Note 4 - “\nLoans and Leases\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)\n are managed by FRG. FRG is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the day-to-day management of workouts, commercial recoveries, and problem loan sales. Its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans, assessing risk ratings, and determining the appropriateness of the allowance, the accrual status, and the ultimate collectability of the Classified loan portfolio.\nC&I PORTFOLIO\nWe manage the risks inherent in the C&I portfolio through origination policies, a defined loan concentration policy with established limits, on-going loan-level and portfolio-level reviews, recourse requirements, and continuous portfolio risk management activities. Our origination policies for the C&I portfolio include loan product-type specific policies such as LTV and debt service coverage ratios, as applicable. \nThe C&I portfolio continues to have solid origination activity while we maintain a focus on high quality originations. We continue to maintain a proactive approach to identifying borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty in order to maximize the potential credit outcomes. Subsequent to the origination of the loan, the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originations.\nCRE PORTFOLIO\nWe manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to CRE lending, focusing on the quality of the developer and the specifics associated with each project. Generally, we: (1) limit our loans to 80% of the appraised value of the commercial real estate at origination, (2) require net operating cash flows to be 120% of required interest and principal payments, and (3) if the commercial real estate is non-owner occupied, require that pre-leasing generates break-even interest-only debt service. We actively monitor property-type concentrations and both geographic and property-type performance metrics of all CRE loan types, with a focus on loans identified as higher risk based on the risk rating methodology. Both macro-level and loan-level stress-test scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the on-going portfolio management process for the CRE portfolio.\nDedicated real estate professionals originate and manage the portfolio. The portfolio is diversified by property-type and loan size, and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio. Subsequent to the origination of the loan, the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originations.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n63\nTable of \nContents\nThe following tables present our commercial real estate portfolio by property-type and geographic location.\nTable 10 - Commercial Real Estate Portfolio by Property-type\nAt December 31, 2024\nAt December 31, 2023\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAmount by Property-Type\n% of Total Loans and Leases\nAmount by Property-Type\n% of Total Loans and Leases\nMulti-family\n$\n4,426 \n3 \n%\n$\n4,708 \n4 \n%\nWarehouse/industrial\n1,604 \n2 \n2,029 \n2 \nOffice\n1,559 \n1 \n1,825 \n1 \nRetail\n1,477 \n1 \n1,725 \n1 \nHotel\n817 \n1 \n938 \n1 \nOther\n1,195 \n1 \n1,197 \n1 \nTotal commercial real estate loans and leases\n$\n11,078 \n9 \n%\n$\n12,422 \n10 \n%\nTable 11 - Commercial Real Estate Portfolio by Geographic Location\nAt December 31, 2024\nAt December 31, 2023\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAmount by Location (1)\n% of Total CRE loans and leases\nAmount by Location (1)\n% of Total CRE loans and leases\nMichigan\n$\n2,148 \n19 \n%\n$\n2,498 \n20 \n%\nOhio\n1,938 \n17 \n2,364 \n19 \nFlorida\n1,064 \n10 \n733 \n6 \nIllinois\n683 \n6 \n904 \n7 \nTexas\n476 \n4 \n605 \n5 \nPennsylvania\n426 \n4 \n354 \n3 \nMinnesota\n413 \n4 \n462 \n4 \nCalifornia\n387 \n3 \n247 \n2 \nGeorgia\n375 \n3 \n368 \n3 \nColorado\n362 \n3 \n398 \n3 \nOther\n2,806 \n27 \n3,489 \n28 \nTotal commercial real estate loans and leases\n$\n11,078 \n100 \n%\n$\n12,422 \n100 \n%\n(1)\nGeographic location based on location of underlying collateral.\nOur CRE portfolio totaled $11.1 billion at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $1.3 billion, or 11%, compared to December 31, 2023, driven by loan pay-offs and a decrease in new originations. The CRE portfolio had an associated allowance coverage of 4.3% and 4.2% at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. \nWith declines in demand and property values of office space across the country, the office sector continues to be an area of uncertainty. Our office portfolio, which is predominantly suburban and multi-tenant loans, totaled $1.6 billion, or 1% of total loans and leases, as of December 31, 2024, compared to $1.8 billion, or 1% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2023. We have established ACL reserves of approximately 11% for our CRE office portfolio as of December 31, 2024, compared to approximately 10% at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, there was $37 million of outstanding balances in the office portfolio that were 30 or more days past due.\nAppraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals, and on an as-needed basis, in compliance with regulatory requirements and to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the on-going management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions. Appraisals are obtained from approved vendors and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process. We continue to perform on-going portfolio level reviews within the CRE portfolio. These reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or leasing revenues associated with the projects being reviewed. This highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers, as well as an in-depth knowledge of CRE project lending and the market environment.\nLEASE FINANCING\nWe manage the risks inherent in the Lease Financing portfolio through external consumer and business credit scoring solutions, internally developed custom probability of default and loss given default models, continuous \n64\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nportfolio risk management activities, and equipment and customer diversification. Our origination policies are aligned by transaction size with increased use of the personal guarantee of principals and external credit scoring tools for smaller transactions and expanded financial analysis and reporting requirements for larger transactions. Our program focuses on high-quality manufacturer, distributor, vendor, or third party originations sources with in-depth partner diligence. The lease financing group may use manufacturer loss risk share programs that provide additional transaction support, but the origination strategy prioritizes strong customer financial condition.\nHigh level business lines are comprised of Industrial Finance, Specialty Finance, Healthcare Finance, Technology Finance, and Specialized Transportation, Franchise, and Government with multiple segments under each main line. We also have specific equipment types or industries designated as low tolerance with additional front-end guidance and diligence requirements. Subsequent to the origination of the lease, the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new lease originations.\nConsumer Credit\nConsumer credit approvals are based on, among other factors, the financial strength and payment history of the borrower, type of exposure, and transaction structure. Consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models. Importantly, certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities in which we operate. For all classes within the consumer loan portfolio, loans are assigned pool level PD factors based on the FICO range within which the borrower’s credit bureau score falls. The credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders, regulators, rating agencies, and consumers. The LGD is related to the type of collateral associated with the credit extension, which typically does not change over the course of the loan term. This allows Huntington to maintain a current view of the customer for credit risk management and ACL purposes. \nIn consumer lending, credit risk is managed from a segment (e.g., loan type, collateral position, geography, etc.) and vintage performance analysis. All portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators. We make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio, which may result in changes to future origination strategies. The credit review group conducts ongoing independent credit origination and process reviews to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes.\nCollection actions by our customer assistance team are initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function. We employ a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness, while maximizing efficiency. In addition to the consumer loan portfolio, the customer assistance team is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases. Collection practices include a single contact point for the majority of the residential real estate secured portfolios. \nRESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE SECURED PORTFOLIOS\nThe properties securing our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located within our geographic footprint. Huntington continues to support our local markets with consistent underwriting across all residential secured products. The residential secured portfolio originations continue to be of high quality. Our portfolio management strategies associated with our Home Savers group allow us to focus on effectively helping our customers with appropriate solutions for their specific circumstances.\nHuntington underwrites all residential mortgage applications centrally, with a focus on higher quality borrowers. We do not originate residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options. Residential mortgages are originated based on a completed full appraisal during the credit underwriting process. We update values in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management, as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions.\nWe are subject to repurchase risk associated with residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. An appropriate level of reserve for representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans sold has been established to address this repurchase risk inherent in the portfolio.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n65\nTable of \nContents\nAUTOMOBILE PORTFOLIO\nOur strategy in the automobile portfolio continues to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both FICO and internal custom scores, combined with appropriate LTVs, terms, and profitability. Our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio, including our newer markets. Although increased origination volume and entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels, we believe our disciplined strategy and operational processes significantly mitigate these risks.\nWe have continued to consistently execute our value proposition and take advantage of available market opportunities. Importantly, we have maintained our high credit quality standards while also maintaining strong origination volume.\nRV AND MARINE PORTFOLIO\nOur strategy in the RV and marine portfolio focuses on high quality borrowers, combined with appropriate LTVs, terms, and profitability. Although entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels, we believe our disciplined strategy and operational processes significantly mitigate these risks.\nCredit Quality\n(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 4 - “\nLoans and Leases\n” and Note 5 - “\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nWe believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: NPAs, NALs, ACL, and NCOs. In addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, product segmentation, and origination trends in the analysis of our credit quality performance.\nCredit quality performance in 2024 reflected NCOs of $372 million, or 0.30%, of average total loans and leases, an increase from $273 million, or 0.23%, in the prior year. The increase reflects a $59 million increase in commercial NCOs and a $40 million increase in consumer NCOs. NPAs increased $111 million, or 16%, to $822 million, primarily driven by a $113 million increase in commercial and industrial NALs.\nNPAs and NALs\nNPAs consist of (1) NALs, which represent loans and leases no longer accruing interest, (2) OREO properties, and (3) other NPAs. Any loan or lease in our portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal or interest is in doubt. Also, when a borrower with discharged non-reaffirmed debt in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is identified and the loan or lease is determined to be collateral dependent, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.\nCommercial loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status at 90-days past due, or earlier if repayment of principal and interest is in doubt. Of the $585 million of commercial related NALs at December 31, 2024, $249 million, or 43%, represent loans and leases that were less than 30-days past due, demonstrating our continued commitment to proactive credit risk management. With the exception of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by government organizations, which continue to accrue interest, first lien loans secured by residential mortgage collateral are placed on nonaccrual status at 150-days past due. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of 120-days past due or when the related first-lien loan has been identified as nonaccrual. Automobile, RV and marine, and other consumer loans are generally fully charged-off at 120-days past due, and if not fully charged-off are placed on non-accrual.\nWhen loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual, any accrued interest is reversed against interest income. When, in our judgment, the borrower’s ability to make required interest and principal payments has resumed and collectability is no longer in doubt, the loan or lease could be returned to accrual status.\n66\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nThe following table reflects period-end NALs and NPAs detail.\nTable 12 - Nonaccrual Loans and Leases and Nonperforming Assets\nAt December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNonaccrual loans and leases (NALs):\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n457 \n$\n344 \nCommercial real estate\n118 \n140 \nLease financing\n10 \n14 \nResidential mortgage\n83 \n72 \nAutomobile\n6 \n4 \nHome equity\n107 \n91 \nRV and marine\n2 \n2 \nTotal nonaccrual loans and leases\n783 \n667 \nOther real estate, net\n8 \n10 \nOther NPAs (1)\n31 \n34 \nTotal nonperforming assets\n$\n822 \n$\n711 \nNonaccrual loans and leases as a % of total loans and leases\n0.60 \n%\n0.55 \n%\nNPA ratio (2)\n0.63 \n0.58 \n(1)\nOther nonperforming assets include certain impaired investment securities and/or nonaccrual loans held-for-sale.\n(2)\nNonperforming assets divided by the sum of loans and leases, other real estate owned, and other NPAs.\nACL\nOur ACL is comprised of two different components, both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio: the ALLL and the AULC. \nWe use statistically-based models that employ assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of the loan. The process of estimating expected credit losses is based on three key parameters: PD, EAD, and LGD. Beyond the reasonable and supportable period (two to three years), the economic variables revert to a historical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy reflected within the economic scenario.\nFuture economic conditions consider multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party and are reviewed through the Allowance for Credit Loss Development Methodology Committee described below. These macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables that are influential to our modeling process, the most significant being unemployment rates and GDP. Management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline, an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate for the allowance. Any changes in probability weights must be supported by appropriate documentation and approval of senior management. Additionally, we consider whether to adjust the modeled estimates to address possible limitations within the models or factors not captured within the macroeconomic scenarios. Lifetime losses for most of our loans and leases are evaluated collectively based on similar risk characteristics such as risk ratings, origination credit bureau scores, delinquency status, and remaining months within loan agreements, among other factors.\nThe baseline scenario used in the December 31, 2024 ACL determination assumes the labor market has softened with the unemployment rate peaking at 4.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Marginal improvement is expected moving forward with unemployment returning to 4.0% by 2026. The Federal Reserve is projected to continue a cycle of rate cuts that started in September 2024, with gradual cuts forecast throughout 2025 and 2026 until reaching 3% in mid-2026. Inflation is forecast to approach the Federal Reserve’s target level of 2% by the end of 2024 and stabilize in 2025. GDP is forecast to show marginal improvement from the estimated fourth quarter 2024 level of 2.0%, ending the fourth quarter of 2025 at 2.1%. \nThe table below is intended to show how the forecasted path of unemployment and GDP in the baseline scenario has changed between those used in the year 2023 and 2024 ACL determination. \n2024 Form 10-K     \n67\nTable of \nContents\nTable 13 - Forecasted Key Macroeconomic Variables\n2023\n2024\n2025\nBaseline scenario forecast\nQ4\nQ2\nQ4\nQ2\nQ4\nUnemployment rate (1)\n4Q 2023\n3.8%\n3.9%\n4.0%\n4.1%\n4.0%\n4Q 2024\nN/A\nN/A\n4.2\n4.1\n4.1\nGross Domestic Product (1)\n4Q 2023\n0.8%\n1.2%\n1.5%\n1.9%\n2.2%\n4Q 2024\nN/A\nN/A\n2.0\n2.1\n2.1\n(1)\nValues reflect the baseline scenario forecast inputs for each period presented, not updated for subsequent actual amounts.\nManagement continues to assess the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including ongoing risks in the commercial real estate environment, current inflation levels, political uncertainty, and geopolitical instability, considering multiple macroeconomic forecasts that reflected a range of possible outcomes. While we have incorporated estimates of economic uncertainty into our ACL, the ultimate impact of specific challenges will have on the economy remains unknown.\nManagement develops additional analytics to support adjustments to our modeled results. Our Allowance for Credit Loss Development Methodology Committee reviewed model results of each economic scenario for appropriate usage, concluding that the quantitative transaction reserve will continue to utilize scenario weighting. Given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions, the December 31, 2024 ACL included a general reserve that consists of various risk profile components, including profiles to capture uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve. \nThe most significant risk profiles the Company maintains at December 31, 2024 relate to business banking loans within the C&I portfolio and office loans within the CRE portfolio. The business banking risk profile addresses a modestly upward trend in default rates resulting from higher interest rates and inflationary impacts on business banking customers. The office portfolio risk profile addresses concerns relating to higher interest rates, upcoming maturities, falling property values, and uncertainty about demand for office space.\nOur Allowance for Credit Loss Development Methodology Committee is responsible for developing the methodology, assumptions, and estimates used in the calculation, as well as determining the appropriateness of the ACL. The ALLL represents the estimate of lifetime expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio at the reported date. The loss modeling process uses an EAD concept to calculate total expected losses on both funded balances and unfunded lending commitments, where appropriate. Losses related to the unfunded lending commitments are then recorded as AULC within other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A liability for expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures is recognized if Huntington has a contractual obligation to extend the credit and the obligation is not unconditionally cancelable.\nThe AULC is determined by applying the same quantitative reserve determination process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation. \nOur ACL evaluation process includes the assessment of credit quality metrics, and a comparison of certain ACL benchmarks to current performance. For further information, including the ALLL and AULC activity by portfolio segment, refer to Note 5 - “\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n68\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nThe table below reflects the allocation of our ALLL among our various loan and lease categories as well as certain coverage metrics of the reported ALLL and ACL.\n \nTable 14 - Allocation of Allowance for Credit Losses\nAt December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAllocation of Allowance\n% of Total ALLL\n% of Total Loans and Leases (1)\nAllocation of Allowance\n% of Total ALLL\n% of Total Loans and Leases (1)\nCommercial\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n947 \n42 \n%\n43 \n%\n$\n993 \n44 \n%\n42 \n%\nCommercial real estate\n473 \n21 \n9 \n522 \n23 \n10 \nLease financing\n64 \n3 \n4 \n48 \n2 \n4 \nTotal commercial\n1,484 \n66 \n56 \n1,563 \n69 \n56 \nConsumer\nResidential mortgage\n205 \n9 \n19 \n188 \n8 \n20 \nAutomobile\n145 \n6 \n11 \n142 \n7 \n10 \nHome equity\n148 \n7 \n8 \n114 \n5 \n8 \nRV and marine\n150 \n7 \n5 \n148 \n7 \n5 \nOther consumer\n112 \n5 \n1 \n100 \n4 \n1 \nTotal consumer\n760 \n34 \n44 \n692 \n31 \n44 \nTotal ALLL\n2,244 \n2,255 \nAULC\n202 \n145 \nTotal ACL\n$\n2,446 \n$\n2,400 \nTotal ALLL as % of:\nTotal loans and leases\n1.73 \n%\n1.85 \n%\nNonaccrual loans and leases\n286 \n338 \nNPAs\n273 \n317 \nTotal ACL as % of:\nTotal loans and leases\n1.88 \n%\n1.97 \n%\nNonaccrual loans and leases\n312 \n360 \nNPAs\n297 \n337 \n(1)\nPercentages represent the percentage of each loan and lease category to total loans and leases.\nAt December 31, 2024, the ACL was $2.4 billion, or 1.88%, of total loans and leases, compared to $2.4 billion, or 1.97%, at December 31, 2023. The increase in the total ACL was driven by loan and lease growth throughout 2024, partially offset by a reduction in the ACL coverage ratio. The reduction in the ACL coverage ratio at December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, is reflective of the current macro-economic environment.\nNCOs\nA loan in any portfolio may be charged-off prior to reaching the past due status described below if a loss confirming event has occurred. Loss confirming events include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy (unsecured), continued delinquency, foreclosure, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency where that asset is the sole source of repayment. Additionally, discharged or collateral dependent non-reaffirmed debt in Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a charge-off to estimated collateral value, less anticipated selling costs at the time of discharge.\nCommercial loans and leases are either charged-off or written down to net realizable value by 90-days past due with the exception of administrative small ticket lease delinquencies. Automobile, RV and marine, and other consumer loans are generally fully charged-off at 120-days past due. First-lien and junior-lien home equity loans are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, at 150-days past due and 120-days past due, respectively. Residential mortgages are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, at 150-days past due. The remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed, or the loan goes through the foreclosure process. \n2024 Form 10-K     \n69\nTable of \nContents\nThe following table reflects NCO detail. \nTable 15 - Net Loan and Lease Charge-offs\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet charge-offs (recoveries) by loan and lease type:\nCommercial:\nCommercial and industrial\n$\n166 \n$\n107 \n$\n(2)\nCommercial real estate\n52 \n57 \n8 \nLease financing\n(1)\n(6)\n9 \nTotal commercial\n217 \n158 \n15 \nConsumer:\nResidential mortgage\n1 \n2 \n(2)\nAutomobile\n35 \n21 \n6 \nHome equity\n(1)\n(1)\n(5)\nRV and marine\n22 \n12 \n8 \nOther consumer\n98 \n81 \n99 \nTotal consumer\n155 \n115 \n106 \nTotal net charge-offs\n$\n372 \n$\n273 \n$\n121 \nNet charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average loans:\nCommercial:\nCommercial and industrial\n0.32 \n%\n0.22 \n%\n— \n%\nCommercial real estate\n0.43 \n0.43 \n0.06 \nLease financing\n(0.03)\n(0.12)\n0.18 \nTotal commercial\n0.31 \n0.23 \n0.03 \nConsumer:\nResidential mortgage\n0.01 \n0.01 \n(0.01)\nAutomobile\n0.26 \n0.16 \n0.05 \nHome equity\n(0.01)\n(0.01)\n(0.05)\nRV and marine\n0.36 \n0.21 \n0.15 \nOther consumer\n6.32 \n6.03 \n7.55 \nTotal consumer\n0.28 \n0.22 \n0.21 \nNet charge-offs as a % of average loans\n0.30 \n%\n0.23 \n%\n0.11 \n%\nNCOs were 0.30% of average loans and leases in 2024, up from 0.23% in 2023, reflecting the continued normalization of net charge-offs.

When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers, and secondarily, to price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans.\n70\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nWe measure market risk exposure via financial simulation models, which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates. Models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve, the direction and volatility of interest rates, and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior. Our models incorporate market-based assumptions that include the impact of changing interest rates on prepayment rates of assets and runoff rates of deposits. The models also include our projections of the future volume and pricing of various business lines.\nIn measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in our balance sheet, we compare a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates. The market forward rates reflect the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points. The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types: “shock” scenarios which are immediate parallel rate shifts, and “ramp” scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first 12 months of the forecast on a pro rata basis. In both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates, we presume that market rates will not go below 0%. The scenarios are inclusive of all executed interest rate risk hedging activities. Forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon.\nA key driver of our interest rate risk profile is our interest-bearing deposit repricing sensitivity assumptions to changes in interest rates, otherwise known as deposit beta. In addition, our interest expense is impacted by the composition of both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits in relation to our total deposits. Accordingly, we consider the impacts from both interest-bearing and noninterest bearing deposits on our total deposit beta. Our cumulative total deposit beta (total cost of deposits) through the most recent rising rate cycle, which started in the first quarter of 2022 and concluded in the third quarter of 2024, was 46%. Following the start of the falling rate cycle, which began late in the third quarter of 2024, our cumulative total deposit beta (total cost of deposits) was 24%. \nInterest rate risk is measured across a range of scenarios and the results are reported to the ROC at least quarterly. A comprehensive discussion of risk management governance can be found in Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the “\nRisk Management\n” section of this Form 10-K.\nWe use two approaches to model interest rate risk: Net interest income at risk (NII at Risk) and economic value of equity at risk modeling sensitivity analysis (EVE at Risk).\nNII at Risk is used by management to measure the risk and impact to earnings over the next 12 months, using a variety of interest rate scenarios. The NII at Risk results included in the table below reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models gradual “ramp” -200, -100, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shift scenarios, implied by the forward yield curve over the next 12 months. \nTable 16 - Net Interest Income at Risk\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nFederal Funds Rate (1)\nFederal Funds Rate (1)\nBasis point change scenario\nStarting Point (2)\nMonth 12 (3)\nNII at Risk (%)\nStarting Point (2)\nMonth 12 (3)\nNII at Risk (%)\n+200\n4.50 \n6.00 \n2.0 \n5.50 \n5.75 \n5.5 \n+100\n4.50 \n5.00 \n0.8 \n5.50 \n4.75 \n3.0 \nBase\n4.50 \n4.00 \n— \n5.50 \n3.75 \n— \n-100\n4.50 \n3.00 \n-0.5 \n5.50 \n2.75 \n-2.8 \n-200\n4.50 \n2.00 \n-1.3 \n5.50 \n1.75 \n-5.6 \n(1)\nRepresents the upper bound.\n(2)\nRepresents the spot federal funds rate.\n(3)\nRepresents the federal funds rate in month 12 given a gradual, parallel “ramp” relative to the base implied forward scenario.\nThe NII at Risk shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The primary driver to the change in sensitivity during 2024 is current and projected balance sheet composition over the simulation horizon, including securities portfolio reinvestment and executed hedging activity.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n71\nTable of \nContents\nEVE at Risk is used by management to measure the impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. The EVE results included in the table below reflect the analysis used monthly by management. It models immediate -200, -100, +100 and +200 basis point parallel “shock” scenarios from the yield curve term points at the specific point in time that EVE sensitivity is measured.\nTable 17 - Economic Value of Equity at Risk\n \nEconomic Value of Equity at Risk (%)\nBasis point change scenario\n-200\n-100\n+100\n+200\nDecember 31, 2024\n5.9 \n4.3 \n-5.8 \n-12.6 \nDecember 31, 2023\n0.1 \n1.6 \n-3.8 \n-8.8 \nThe change in sensitivity from December 31, 2023 was driven primarily by market rates, ongoing balance sheet modeling assumption enhancements, and changes to the actual balance sheet composition.\nUse of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk\nAn integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, swaptions, floors, forward contracts, and forward starting interest rate swaps, are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements. These instruments provide flexibility in adjusting Huntington’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates without exposure to loss of principal and higher funding requirements.\nTable 18 shows all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates. The interest rates variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or impact the cash flows attributable to net interest margin. These positions are used to protect the fair value of asset and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. The positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate. The volume, maturity, and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For further information, including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to Note 19 - “\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n72\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nThe following presents additional information about the interest rate swaps and floors used in Huntington’s asset and liability management activities.\nTable 18 - Information on Asset Liability Management Instruments\nNotional Value\nWeighted-Average Maturity (years)\nFair\n Value\nWeighted-Average Fixed Rate\nWeighted-Average Reset Rate\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nAt December 31, 2024\nAsset conversion swaps\nSecurities (1):\nPay Fixed - Receive SOFR\n$\n10,059 \n1.92 \n$\n407 \n1.38 \n%\n4.65 \n%\nPay Fixed - Receive SOFR - forward starting (2)\n928 \n7.46 \n45 \n2.81 \n— \nLoans:\nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR\n10,075 \n2.18 \n(255)\n2.75 \n4.60 \nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR - forward starting (3)\n7,225 \n4.03 \n(75)\n3.62 \n— \nLiability conversion swaps\nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR\n7,272 \n3.24 \n(197)\n3.30 \n4.66 \nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR - forward starting (3)\n4,075 \n4.60 \n(56)\n3.64 \n— \nPurchased floor spreads (4)\nPurchased Floor Spread - SOFR \n6,000 \n1.83 \n24 \n2.79 / 3.87\n— \nBasis swaps (5)\nPay SOFR- Receive Fed Fund (economic hedges)\n174 \n1.58 \n— \n5.19 \n5.21 \nPay Fed Fund - Receive SOFR (economic hedges) \n1 \n10.81 \n— \n5.24 \n5.15 \nTotal swap portfolio\n$\n45,809 \n$\n(107)\nAt December 31, 2023\nAsset conversion swaps\nSecurities (1):\nPay Fixed - Receive SOFR\n$\n10,721 \n3.11 \n$\n683 \n1.37 \n%\n5.42 \n%\nPay Fixed - Receive SOFR - forward starting (2)\n928 \n8.46 \n18 \n2.81 \n— \nLoans:\nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR\n9,275 \n3.06 \n(243)\n2.77 \n5.34 \nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR - forward starting (6)\n1,400 \n4.20 \n(19)\n2.90 \n— \nLiability conversion swaps\nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR\n7,568 \n3.40 \n(199)\n2.95 \n5.14 \nReceive Fixed - Pay SOFR - forward starting (6)\n2,125 \n3.16 \n45 \n4.33 \n— \nPurchased floor spreads (4)\nPurchased Floor Spread - SOFR\n5,000 \n2.29 \n38 \n2.97 / 3.97\n— \nPurchased Floor Spread - SOFR forward starting (7)\n1,000 \n5.54 \n26 \n1.88 / 3.38\n— \nBasis swaps (5)\nPay SOFR- Receive Fed Fund (economic hedges) \n174 \n2.58\n— \n5.33 \n5.41 \nPay Fed Fund - Receive SOFR (economic hedges) \n1 \n11.81 \n— \n5.45 \n5.33 \nTotal swap portfolio\n$\n38,192 \n$\n349 \n(1)\nAmounts include interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate investment securities using the portfolio layer method.\n(2)\nForward starting swaps effective starting from April 2025 to October 2027.\n(3)\nForward starting swaps effective starting from January 2025 to June 2026.\n(4)\nThe weighted average fixed rates for floor spreads are the weighted average strike rates for the upper and lower bounds of the instruments.\n(5)\nBasis swaps have variable pay and variable receive resets.

When we purchase credit protection, such as a CDS, we pay a fee to the seller, or CDS counterparty, in return for the right to receive a payment if a specified credit event occurs. \n2024 Form 10-K     \n73\nTable of \nContents\nMSRs\n(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 6 - “\nMortgage Loan Sales and Servicing Rights\n” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nAt December 31, 2024, we had a total of $573 million of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service $33.7 billion in mortgage loans. \nMSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit quality. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of MSR fair value changes or impairment. However, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges. Changes in the MSR value net of hedge-related trading activity are recorded in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income. \nMSR assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrice Risk\nPrice risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, derivative instruments, and equity investments. We have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held. \nLiquidity Risk \nLiquidity risk is the possibility of us being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner. The goal of liquidity management is to ensure adequate, stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds to satisfy changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals, investment opportunities, and other contractual obligations. We consider core earnings, strong capital ratios, and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings, which allows us cost-effective access to market-based liquidity. We mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining a large, stable customer deposit base and a diversified base of readily available wholesale funding sources, including secured funding sources from the FHLB and FRB through pledged borrowing capacity, issuance through dealers in the capital markets, and access to deposits issued through brokers. We further mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents and securities. \nThe Board of Directors is responsible for establishing an acceptable level of liquidity risk at Huntington, including approval of the liquidity risk appetite at least annually. The liquidity risk appetite includes liquidity risk metrics that are designed and monitored to ensure Huntington maintains adequate liquidity to meet current and future funding needs, including during periods of potential stress. Further, the ALCO is appointed by the ROC to oversee liquidity risk management, including the establishment of liquidity risk policies and additional liquidity risk metrics and limits to support our overall liquidity risk appetite. Liquidity risk appetite metrics monitored by senior management and reported to the Board at least semi-annually include loans as a percentage of customer deposits, a structural funding ratio, internal liquidity stress test coverage ratios, an investment portfolio market value to book value ratio, and a holding company cash coverage ratio. Additional key liquidity risk metrics monitored by senior management and reported to ALCO monthly include unsecured wholesale funding as a percentage of liquid assets, wholesale funding as a percentage of tangible assets, and varying types of internally defined liquidity coverage ratios, including minimum reserve balances at the FRB and U.S. Treasury holdings relative to internal liquidity stress outflows. Our liquidity risk metric monitoring thresholds are evaluated at a minimum annually, and more frequently if conditions warrant.\n74\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nLiquidity risk is managed centrally by Corporate Treasury with independent oversight of liquidity risk performed by Corporate Risk Management. Our liquidity position is evaluated daily, weekly, and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources, reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future months, and identifying sources and uses of funds. The overall management of our liquidity position is also integrated into consumer and commercial pricing policies to ensure a stable deposit base. Liquidity risk is reviewed and managed continuously for the Bank and the parent company, as well as its subsidiaries. In addition, liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions, provide policy guidance, review funding strategies, and oversee the adherence to, and maintenance of, contingency funding plans. At December 31, 2024, management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet Huntington’s on and off-balance sheet obligations.\nWe maintain a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the potential erosion of funds in the event of an institution-specific event or systemic financial market crisis. Examples of institution specific events could include a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency, a large charge to earnings, declines in profitability or other financial measures, declines in liquidity sources including reductions in deposit balances or access to contingent funding sources, or a significant merger or acquisition. Examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, failure of a major financial institution, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund, or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation or rumors about us, or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources. The contingency funding plan, which is reviewed and approved by the ROC at least annually, outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis and provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities and communication protocols for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period and outlines early warning indicators that are used to monitor emerging liquidity stress events.\nDeposits\nOur largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is customer deposits, which provide stable and lower-cost funding. Our customer deposits come from a base of primary bank customer relationships, and we continue to focus on acquiring and deepening those relationships resulting in a diversified deposit base. Total deposits were $162.4 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $151.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The $11.2 billion, or 7%, increase in total deposits during 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in money market and interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits. Total deposits included $7.0 billion of brokered deposits primarily consisting of brokered money market balances at December 31, 2024, compared to $5.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The level of brokered deposits was below our established liquidity risk metric limits at December 31, 2024.\nInsured deposits comprised approximately 69% of our total deposits at December 31, 2024, compared to 70% at December 31, 2023. \n2024 Form 10-K     \n75\nTable of \nContents\nThe following table presents a summary of deposits.\nTable 19 - Deposit Composition\nAt December 31, \n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nBy Type:\nDemand deposits—noninterest-bearing \n$\n29,345 \n18 \n%\n$\n30,967 \n20 \n%\nDemand deposits—interest-bearing \n43,378 \n27 \n39,190 \n26 \nMoney market deposits \n60,730 \n37 \n50,185 \n34 \nSavings deposits\n14,723 \n9 \n15,763 \n10 \nTime deposits\n14,272 \n9 \n15,125 \n10 \nTotal deposits\n$\n162,448 \n100 \n%\n$\n151,230 \n100 \n%\nTotal deposits (insured/uninsured):\nInsured deposits\n$\n112,394 \n69 \n%\n$\n105,986 \n70 \n%\nUninsured deposits (1)\n50,054 \n31 \n45,244 \n30 \nTotal deposits\n$\n162,448 \n100 \n%\n$\n151,230 \n100 \n%\n(1)\nRepresents consolidated Huntington uninsured deposits, determined by adjusting the amounts reported in the Bank Call Report (FFIEC 031) by inter-company deposits, which are not customer deposits and are therefore eliminated through consolidation.

As of December 31, 2023, the Bank Call Report uninsured deposit balance was $49.8 billion, which includes $4.6 billion of inter-company deposits. \nThe majority of our time deposits have a contractual maturity of less than one year. The following table presents the contractual maturities of time deposits in excess of the FDIC insurance limit.\nTable 20 - Maturity of Deposits in Excess of Insurance Limit\nAt December 31, 2024\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n3 months\nor less\n3 months\nto 6 months\n6 months\nto 12 months\n12 months\nor more\nTotal\nPortion of U.S. time deposits in excess of insurance limit\n$\n915 \n$\n365 \n$\n170 \n$\n23 \n$\n1,473 \nWholesale funding\nSources of wholesale funding include non-customer brokered deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. Our wholesale funding totaled $23.6 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $18.3 billion at December 31, 2023, with the increase primarily due to increases in long-term FHLB borrowings, brokered deposits, and long-term collateralized borrowings. For further information on our short-term borrowings and long-term debt, \nrefer to Note 10 - “\nBorrowings\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n.\nCash and cash equivalents and securities\nCash and cash equivalents were $12.8 billion and $10.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The $2.7 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents during 2024 was primarily due to an increase in interest-earning deposits at the FRB to support short-term liquidity.\nOur investment securities portfolio is evaluated under established ALCO objectives. Changing market conditions could affect the profitability of the portfolio, as well as the level of interest rate risk exposure.\nTotal investment securities were $43.7 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to $41.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The $2.5 billion increase in securities compared to December 31, 2023, was due to increased investment in U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by maturities and sales during the year. At December 31, 2024, the duration of the investment securities portfolio was 4.3 years, or 3.8 years net of hedging. Securities are pledged to secure borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB, discussed further in the \nBank Liquidity and Sources of Funding\n section below.

To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through customer deposits, cash and cash equivalents, and securities, we may meet our liquidity needs through wholesale funding and asset securitization or sale. Additionally, the Bank may also access funding through intercompany notes or parent company deposits placed at the bank. \nThe Bank maintains borrowing capacity at both the FHLB and FRB secured by pledged loans and securities. The Bank does not consider borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve a primary source of funding, however, it could be used as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. At December 31, 2024, the Bank’s available contingent borrowing capacity at the FHLB and FRB totaled $85.5 billion, compared to $83.0 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase reflects our continued optimization of contingent borrowing capacity through the pledging of incremental assets. The amount of available contingent borrowing capacity may fluctuate based on the level of borrowings outstanding and level of assets pledged.\nAt December 31, 2024, we believe the Bank has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n77\nTable of \nContents\nParent Company Liquidity\nThe parent company’s primary financial obligations consist of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends and interest received from the Bank, interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt instruments.\n The parent company had cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which was held in deposit at the Bank. S\nee Note 23 - “\nParent-Only Financial Statements\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on parent company cash flows.\nOn January 15, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.155 per common share. The dividend is payable on April 1, 2025, to shareholders of record on March 18, 2025. Based on the current quarterly dividend of $0.155 per common share, cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately $225 million per quarter. Additionally, on January 15, 2025, our Board of Directors declared quarterly Series B, F, G, H, and J Preferred Stock dividends payable on April 15, 2025 to shareholders of record on April 1, 2025. On December 5, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend for the Series I Preferred Stock payable on March 3, 2025 to shareholders of record on February 15, 2025. Total cash demands required for preferred stock dividends are expected to be approximately $27 million per quarter.\nDuring 2024, the Bank paid common and preferred dividends to the parent company of $2.0 billion and $56 million, respectively. To meet any additional liquidity needs, the parent company may issue debt or equity securities. To support the parent company’s ability to issue debt or equity securities, we have filed with the SEC an automatic shelf registration statement covering an indeterminate amount or number of securities to be offered or sold from time to time as authorized by the Huntington’s Board of Directors.\nAt December 31, 2024, we believe the Company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, interest rate swaps, floors, financial guarantees contained in standby letters-of-credit issued by the Bank, and commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage loans.\nCOMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT\nCommitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit Huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customer’s credit quality. These arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions, credit quality, probability of funding, and other relevant factors. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements. The interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature. \nSee Note 21 - “\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nSTANDBY LETTERS-OF-CREDIT\nStandby letters-of-credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters-of-credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the parent company and the Bank are required to hold. Through our credit process, we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby letters-of-credit. When it is probable that a standby letter-of-credit will be drawn and not repaid in full, a loss is recognized in the provision for credit losses. \nSee Note 21 - “\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n78\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nCOMMITMENTS TO SELL LOANS\nActivity related to our mortgage origination activity supports the hedging of the mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties. In addition, we have commitments to sell residential real estate loans. These contracts mature in less than one year. \nSee Note 21 - “\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nWe enter into various contractual obligations in the normal course of business, certain of which require future payments that could impact our liquidity and capital resources. These obligations include purchase commitments, which represent substantial agreements to purchase goods or receive services, such as data management, media, and other software and third-party services that are enforceable and legally binding. Purchase commitments totaled $716 million as of December 31, 2024 and $581 million as of December 31, 2023. These obligations additionally include deposits, borrowings, operating lease obligations, commitments to extend credit, commitments to fund certain equity investments, and obligations to fund pension and post-retirement benefit plans. \nSee Note \n10\n - “\nBorrowings\n”, Note 9 - “\nOperating Lease\ns\n”, Note 21 - “\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\n”, Note 20 - “\nVariable Interest Entities\n”, and Note 16 - “\nBenefit Plans\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss due to human error, third-party performance failures, or inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, failed business contingency plans, and security risks. We continuously strive to test and strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with significant contracts, agreements, laws, rules, and regulations, to reduce our exposure to fraud, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. \nTo govern operational risks, we have an Operational Risk Committee, a Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Committee, a Funds Movement Committee, a Fraud Risk Committee, an Information and Technology Risk Committee, and a Third Party Risk Management Committee. The responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. In addition, we have a Model Risk Oversight Committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. These committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the Risk Management Committee. Potential concerns may be escalated to our ROC and our Audit Committee, as appropriate.\nThe goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk-monitoring; minimize operational, fraud, and legal losses; minimize the impact of inadequately designed models; and enhance our overall performance.\nCybersecurity\nCybersecurity represents an important component of Huntington’s overall cross-functional approach to risk management. We actively manage a cybersecurity operation designed to detect, contain, and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents in a prompt and effective manner with the goal of minimizing disruptions to our business. We actively monitor cyberattacks, such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data. We evaluate our technology, processes, and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses. Cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and increase across the entire digital landscape. We actively monitor our environment for malicious content and implement specific cybersecurity and fraud capabilities, including the monitoring of phishing email campaigns. In addition, we have implemented specific cybersecurity and fraud monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins, since a significant portion of our workforce works remotely from time-to-time. \n2024 Form 10-K     \n79\nTable of \nContents\nOur objective for managing cybersecurity risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of both internal and external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems. We work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack, and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals. To this end we employ a set of defense in-depth strategies, which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats, while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response. Potential concerns related to cybersecurity may be escalated to our board-level ROC and/or Technology Committee, as appropriate. \nAs a complement to the overall cybersecurity risk management, we use a number of internal training methods, both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates, to ensure awareness of the risks of cybersecurity threats at all levels across the organization. Internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks. We also use third-party services to test the effectiveness of our cybersecurity risk management framework, and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality.\nCompliance Risk\nFinancial institutions are subject to many laws, rules, and regulations at both the federal and state levels. These broad-based laws, rules, and regulations include, but are not limited to, expectations relating to anti-money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, prohibitions against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, protections for military members as they enter active duty, and community reinvestment. The volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk. As such, we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met, including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Our colleagues receive training for several broad-based laws and regulations including, but not limited to, anti-money laundering and customer privacy. Additionally, colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, and/or other courses related to the extension of credit. We hold ourselves to a high standard for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance.\nCAPITAL\n(This section should be read in conjunction with the “\nRegulatory Matters\n” section included in Part I, Item 1: Business and Note 22 - “\nOther Regulatory Matters\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nOur primary capital objective is to maintain appropriate levels of capital within our Board-approved risk appetite to support the Bank's operations, absorb unanticipated losses and declines in asset values, and provide protection to uninsured depositors and debt holders in the event of liquidation, while also funding organic growth and providing appropriate returns to our shareholders. Both regulatory capital and shareholders’ equity are managed at the Bank and on a consolidated basis. We have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall capital adequacy, including the monitoring and reporting of capital risk metrics to the Board and ROC that we believe are useful for evaluating capital adequacy and making capital decisions. In addition to as-reported regulatory capital and tangible common equity metrics, which are discussed in more detail below, we also actively monitor other measures of capital, such as tangible common equity including the mark-to-market impact on HTM securities and CET1 inclusive of AOCI excluding cash flow hedges. We believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders’ equity are adequate.\nRegulatory Capital\nWe are subject to the Basel III capital requirements including the standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart D of the final capital rule. The following table presents consolidated risk-weighted assets and other financial data necessary to calculate certain financial ratios, including CET1, which we use to measure capital adequacy. \n80\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nTable 22 - Capital Under Current Regulatory Standards\n At December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\nCET1 risk-based capital ratio:\nTotal shareholders’ equity\n$\n19,740 \n$\n19,353 \nRegulatory capital adjustments:\nCECL transitional amount (1)\n109 \n219 \nShareholders’ preferred equity and related surplus\n(1,999)\n(2,404)\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n2,866 \n2,676 \nGoodwill and other intangible assets, net of taxes\n(5,534)\n(5,591)\nDeferred tax assets that arise from tax loss and credit carryforwards\n(55)\n(41)\nCET1 capital\n15,127 \n14,212 \nAdditional tier 1 capital\nShareholders’ preferred equity and related surplus\n1,999 \n2,404 \nTier 1 capital\n17,126 \n16,616 \nLong-term debt and other tier 2 qualifying instruments\n1,641 \n1,306 \nQualifying allowance for loan and lease losses\n1,798 \n1,735 \nTier 2 capital\n3,439 \n3,041 \nTotal risk-based capital\n$\n20,565 \n$\n19,657 \nRWA\n$\n143,650 \n$\n138,706 \nCET1 risk-based capital ratio\n10.5 \n%\n10.2 \n%\nOther regulatory capital data:\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio\n11.9 \n12.0 \nTotal risk-based capital ratio\n14.3 \n14.2 \nTier 1 leverage ratio\n8.6 \n9.3 \n(1)\nHuntington elected to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period which began January 1, 2022 pursuant to a rule that allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL.

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have phased in 75% and 50%, respectively, of the cumulative CECL deferral, with the cumulative CECL deferral fully phased in beginning January 1, 2025.\nAt December 31, 2024, Huntington and the Bank maintained capital ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the Federal Reserve. Our consolidated CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.5% at December 31, 2024 increased approximately 30 basis points during the year, primarily due to current period earnings, net of dividends, partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets and a reduction in the CECL transitional amount. The Bank CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.6% increased approximately 100 basis points during the year driven by net income and a $1.75 billion capital contribution from the parent, partially offset by dividends paid to the parent, an increase in risk-weighted assets, and a reduction in the CECL transitional amount. The increase in risk-weighted assets was driven by loan growth, partially offset by the impact of two CLN transactions completed during 2024. The CLN transactions involved an original aggregate reference pool of approximately $8 billion of on-balance sheet prime indirect auto loans as part of the company's capital optimization strategy, with the transactions reducing the risk-weighting on the reference pool of assets by approximately 75%.\nShareholders’ Equity\nWe generate shareholders’ equity primarily through the retention of earnings, net of dividends. Other potential sources of shareholders’ equity include issuances of common and preferred stock. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives, to meet both regulatory and market expectations, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities. \nShareholders’ equity totaled $19.7 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $387 million, or 2%, when compared with December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by earnings, net of dividends, partially offset by the $405 million redemption of Series E preferred stock, and changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss driven by changes in interest rates.\n82\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nShare Repurchases\nFrom time to time the Board of Directors authorizes the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce when our Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block transactions, forward transactions, and similar transactions. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations.\nHuntington did not have any share repurchases during 2024 or 2023. As part of our 2024 capital plan and our\ncurrent expectation that organic capital will be used for funding loan and lease growth and increase overall capital levels, we do not expect to have share repurchases through 2025. \nBUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION\nOverview\nOur business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how management monitors results and assesses performance. We have two business segments: Consumer & Regional Banking and Commercial Banking. The Treasury / Other function includes all other items not included within our two business segments, including technology and operations, and other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. \nBusiness segment results are determined based upon our management practices, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. \nRevenue Sharing\nRevenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations.\nExpense Allocation\nThe management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. These activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to the business segments from Treasury / Other. We utilize a full-allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except reported acquisition-related expenses, if any, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the business segments.\nFunds Transfer Pricing (FTP)\nWe use an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing modeled duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the Treasury / Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The Treasury / Other function charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets (or liabilities). The primary components of the FTP rate include a base (market) rate, a liquidity premium, contingent liquidity and collateral charges, and option cost.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n83\nTable of \nContents\nNet Income (Loss) by Business Segment\nNet income (loss) for our business segments and Treasury/Other function for the past three years is presented in the following table.\nTable 25 - Net Income (Loss) by Business Segment\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nConsumer & Regional Banking\n$\n1,512 \n$\n1,315 \n$\n1,027 \nCommercial Banking\n1,153 \n1,179 \n1,087 \nTreasury / Other\n(725)\n(543)\n124 \nNet income attributable to Huntington\n$\n1,940 \n$\n1,951 \n$\n2,238 \nConsumer & Regional Banking\nTable 26 - Key Performance Indicators for Consumer & Regional Banking\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nChange from 2023\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollar amounts in millions unless otherwise noted)\n2024\n2023\nAmount\nPercent\n2022\nNet interest income\n$\n4,070 \n$\n3,717 \n$\n353 \n9 \n%\n$\n3,213 \nProvision for credit losses\n284 \n246 \n38 \n15 \n260 \nNet interest income after provision for credit losses\n3,786 \n3,471 \n315 \n9 \n2,953 \nNoninterest income\n1,301 \n1,257 \n44 \n4 \n1,272 \nNoninterest expense:\nDirect personnel costs\n1,135 \n1,138 \n(3)\n— \n1,124 \nOther noninterest expense, including corporate allocations\n2,038 \n1,926 \n112 \n6 \n1,800 \nTotal noninterest expense\n3,173 \n3,064 \n109 \n4 \n2,924 \nIncome before income taxes\n1,914 \n1,664 \n250 \n15 \n1,301 \nProvision for income taxes\n402 \n349 \n53 \n15 \n274 \nNet income attributable to Huntington\n$\n1,512 \n$\n1,315 \n$\n197 \n15 \n%\n$\n1,027 \nNumber of employees (average full-time equivalent)\n11,191 \n11,536 \n(345)\n(3)\n%\n11,984 \nTotal average assets\n$\n75,021 \n$\n71,214 \n$\n3,807 \n5 \n$\n69,176 \nTotal average loans/leases\n69,181 \n65,349 \n3,832 \n6 \n62,881 \nTotal average deposits\n110,180 \n105,821 \n4,359 \n4 \n105,469 \nNet interest margin\n3.63 \n%\n3.45 \n%\n0.18 \n%\n5 \n2.99 \n%\nNCOs\n$\n215 \n$\n155 \n$\n60 \n39 \n$\n120 \nNCOs as a % of average loans and leases\n0.31 \n%\n0.24 \n%\n0.07 \n%\n29 \n0.19 \n%\nTotal assets under management (in billions)—eop\n$\n34.0 \n$\n29.0 \n$\n5.0 \n17 \n$\n26.1 \nTotal trust assets (in billions)—eop\n198.7 \n172.2 \n26.5 \n15 \n135.7 \nConsumer & Regional Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion in 2024, an increase of $197 million, or 15%, compared to the year-ago period.

Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein. \nFully-Taxable Equivalent Basis\nInterest income, yields, and ratios on an FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on an FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21%. We encourage readers to consider the \nConsolidated Financial Statements\n and other financial information contained in this Form 10-K in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n2024 Form 10-K     \n87\nTable of \nContents\nNon-Regulatory Capital Ratios\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including tangible common equity to tangible assets.\nNon-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in GAAP or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company are considered non-GAAP financial measures.\nBecause there are no standardized definitions for non-regulatory capital ratios, the Company’s calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, we encourage readers to consider the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-K in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nRisk Factors\nMore information on risk is discussed in the Risk Factors section included in Item 1A: “\nRisk Factors\n” of this report. Additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the Risk Management and Capital discussion of this report, as well as the “\nRegulatory Matters\n” section included in Item 1: Business of this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates \nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 1 - “\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference into this MD&A, describes the significant accounting policies we used in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAn accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur ACL at December 31, 2024 represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments. Management estimates the ACL by projecting probability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default, conditional on economic parameters, for the remaining contractual term. Internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances, the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. We utilize statistically-based models that employ assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of our loan portfolio. As part of our model risk oversight, we perform ongoing monitoring of model performance to assess modeling approaches and identify potential model enhancements, which may result in updates to our statistically based models from time-to-time.\nOne of the most significant judgments influencing the ACL estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts. Key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted unemployment rates and GDP. Changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses, which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next.\nGiven the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance. As a result, management uses a probability-weighted approach that incorporates a baseline, an adverse, and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate.\n88\n     Huntington Bancshares Incorporated\nTable of \nContents\nTo illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, management calculated a quantitative allowance using a 100% weighting applied to an adverse scenario. This scenario contemplates elevated interest rates weakening credit-sensitive consumer spending and confidence, growing concerns about the impact of potential tariffs reducing consumer and business sentiment, and deepening fiscal disputes in Congress causing further sentiment decline. Concerns about the banking industry also impact consumer confidence, causing banks to tighten lending standards. Increased geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan briefly impact the supply chain for semiconductors and the threat of a wider conflict causes consumer confidence to fall. Additionally, the Russian invasion of Ukraine lasts longer than in the baseline scenario and concerns increase around the current conflict in the Middle East leading to a broader war in the region. The combination of still elevated interest rates, political tensions, and tightening lending standards cause the stock market to fall. The economy falls into a recession in the first quarter of 2025. In response to the recession, the Federal Reserve cuts the federal funds rate more aggressively with rates significantly below the baseline forecast starting in the first quarter of 2025. Under this scenario, as an example, the unemployment rate increases from baseline levels and remains elevated for a prolonged period. The rate in this adverse scenario is projected at 8.2% at the end of 2025, approximately 4.1% higher than the baseline scenario projection.\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our ACL at December 31, 2024, management calculated the difference between our quantitative ACL and this 100% adverse scenario. Excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our ACL of approximately $0.8 billion at December 31, 2024.\nThe resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following:\n•\nManagement uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process;\n•\nThe highly uncertain economic environment; \n•\nThe difficulty in predicting the inter-relationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios; and\n•\nThe sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework.\nWe regularly review our ACL for appropriateness by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. In doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each reporting date. Large loan exposures may be addressed through a portfolio heterogeneity reserve. We also consider how significant changes in underwriting policies and procedures could impact the ACL, including consideration of material changes in portfolio growth rates or credit terms. Any changes to management and staffing that could impact lending, collections, or other relevant departments that could increase risk within the allowance process are also contemplated. Observed changes in the quality of the credit review process identified by the second and third line reviews are also given appropriate consideration.\nThere is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast. Additionally, events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or our markets such as geopolitical instability, or risks of elevated interest rates for longer including a near-term recession, could severely impact our current expectations. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the geopolitical instability and risks of elevated interest rates for longer will continue to negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, liquidity, and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time. \n2024 Form 10-K     \n89\nTable of \nContents\nGoodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting requires that assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets and liabilities often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. This typically results in goodwill, the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value, which is subject to impairment testing at least annually. \nManagement reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value.\nBased on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of October 1, 2024, it was determined that the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its respective carrying value as of October 1, 2024; therefore, goodwill is considered not impaired. Huntington additionally performs sensitivity analyses around discount rate assumptions utilized in order to assess the reasonableness of the rates, and the resulting estimated fair values. As of October 1, 2024, a 100 basis point increase in discount rates would reduce estimated entity level fair value by approximately $3 billion and would not result in any goodwill impairment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments\nNote 2 - “\nAccounting Standards Update\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2024 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this MD&A and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",
