  "item1": "Item 1.  Business\nGeneral\nPool Corporation (the \nCompany\n, which may also be referred to as \nwe, us\n or \nour\n), a member of the S&P 500 Index, is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products and is one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape maintenance products in the United States.  \nWe believe that our industry is fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then efficiently distributing the products with high levels of service to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we operated 448 sales centers in North America, Europe and Australia, from which we sell swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products, irrigation and landscape maintenance products and hardscape, tile and stone products to our customer base, including pool builders, retail stores, service companies, landscape contractors and others, through our five distribution networks listed below:\n•\nSCP Distributors (SCP);\n•\nSuperior Pool Products (Superior);\n•\nHorizon Distributors (Horizon); \n•\nNational Pool Tile (NPT); and \n•\nSun Wholesale Supply (Sun Wholesale).\nOur Industry\nWe operate in the outdoor living industry, which services approximately 11.0 million bodies of water in the United States alone, including 5.4 million in-ground swimming pools.  These pools require routine maintenance throughout their lifetime, and we believe significant growth opportunities reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools.  We continue to add products to take advantage of technological advancements and the development of sustainable, energy-efficient and more aesthetically attractive products.  We believe that the pool industry will continue to grow with the increased penetration of new pools into households with the discretionary income and physical capacity to install a swimming pool.  Further, we believe the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with water-sensing and battery-powered alternatives, hardscapes, lighting and other outdoor living-related products provides us with additional future growth opportunities.  \nOver the past several years, favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry, and we believe these trends will continue over the long term.  These favorable trends include the following:\n•\nlong-term growth in housing units in warmer climate markets due to the population migration toward the southern United States, where outdoor home entertainment is more prevalent and extends longer throughout the year;\n•\nincreased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment as lower housing turnover encourages consumers to renovate their existing homes;\n•\nconsumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products, with new irrigation systems, landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels; \n•\nconsumers using more automation and control products, higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time; and\n•\nconsumers increasing focus on sustainable, energy-efficient products.\nIn 2024, we estimate that close to 65% of our sales through the swimming pool industry are related to maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools.  Maintaining a safe and consistent water chemistry as well as necessary upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies.  The recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry contribution to revenue over time.  This characteristic has helped buffer our performance when unfavorable economic conditions, such as higher interest rates and softness in the housing market, adversely impact consumer discretionary spending, including pool construction and major replacement and renovation activities.  As the installed base of in-ground swimming pools ages, we also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s \n1\nappearance and the overall look of backyard environments create ongoing demand for our other discretionary and non-discretionary products.  \nThe following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground swimming pools over the past 11 years (based on Company estimates for 2024 and information from 2023 P.K. Data, Inc. reports): \nWe estimate that just over 20% of our current year sales were derived from the swimming pool remodel, renovation and upgrade market.  The activity in this market, which includes major swimming pool remodeling and upgrading, is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools and availability of enhanced feature products such as swimming pool automated controls, variable speed pumps, robotic cleaners and LED pool and hot tub lighting.  Many new homeowners with existing pools transform older pools into a modern backyard oasis through upgraded features, finishes and equipment.  Among other factors such as the southern population migration and housing shortage trends, the timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors including home values, existing single-family home sales and consumer confidence as compared to the non-discretionary demand of the maintenance and minor repair market.  \nWe estimate that new swimming pool construction comprised almost 15% of 2024 sales.  The demand for new pools is generally driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including increased use of outdoor space, enhanced property value, relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience.  The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations.  \nThe irrigation and landscape maintenance industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry, and we believe that it exhibits similar long-term growth potential.  Irrigation system installations often occur in tandem with new single-family home construction making them more susceptible to economic variables that drive new home sales.  However, the landscape industry offers similar maintenance-related growth opportunities as the swimming pool industry.  Product offerings such as chemicals and fertilizers, power equipment and related repair and maintenance services offer recurring revenue streams in an industry otherwise closely tied to the new housing market.  The irrigation and landscape maintenance distribution business serves both residential and commercial markets, with the majority of sales related to the residential market.  Within the United States market, we believe that residential and commercial irrigation systems, landscape maintenance products, power equipment, hardscapes and specialty outdoor products and accessories offer a total addressable market value of approximately $19.0 billion.  \n2\nEconomic Environment\nCertain trends in the housing market, the cost and availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions (as commonly measured by Gross Domestic Product or GDP) affect our industry, particularly the installation of new pools and irrigation systems, as well as the timing and extent of pool remodels, equipment replacements, landscaping projects and outdoor living space renovations.  Consumers typically spend more on new pools, new irrigation systems, renovations and replacement when general economic conditions are strong. \nExisting home turnover continued to decline in 2024 driven by high interest rates and homeowners taking advantage of their existing lower rate mortgages.  Nonetheless, new home construction grew versus a decline in new pool construction, creating more available backyards for swimming pools when economic conditions stabilize.  We believe that over the long term, higher rates of home appreciation and turnover have a positive impact on new pool installations.  While most new swimming pools are installed in existing homes, there has also been a correlation of new pool construction activity to new home construction activities over time.  We also believe that homeowners’ discretionary spending capacity, availability of consumer credit and favorable borrowing rates are critical factors enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems.  Similar to other discretionary purchases, replacement and renovation activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence, GDP and employment levels.  During periods of high demand, contractor labor availability can limit our customers’ ability to fully meet consumer construction and renovation demand.  \nIn recent years, steady increases in home values, lack of affordable new homes and increased mortgage rates have prompted homeowners to stay in their homes longer.  Although homeowners’ investment in their houses has moderated from the pandemic heightened levels of 2020 to 2022, home investment levels generally remain favorable.  We estimate that new in-ground pool construction units decreased 15% from 72,000 units in 2023 to approximately 61,000 units in 2024 as demand has continued to normalize and was particularly pressured by the unfavorable macroeconomic environment.  We expect that consumers will continue to invest in outdoor living spaces as they consider backyards an extension of their home space.  We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the inherent long-term growth opportunities in our industry fueled by favorable population migration trends, strong housing demand dynamics and product developments and technological advancements as consumers focus on more sustainable and energy-efficient products.    \nWe generally pass industry price increases through our supply chain and from time to time may make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases in order to obtain favorable pricing.  During 2022, supply chain interruptions, production shutdowns and weather-related events resulted in an increased inflation benefit of 10% as higher costs to produce and transport finished products were passed through to consumers.  Inflationary product cost increases moderated in 2023 to approximately 3% to 4%.  In 2024, inflationary product cost increases returned to our historical average of approximately 1% to 2%, which we expect to continue into 2025.\nBusiness Strategy and Growth Strategy\nOur mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers, creating exceptional return to our shareholders, while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees.  Our core strategies are as follows:\n•\nto promote the growth of our industry;\n•\nto promote the growth of our customers’ businesses; and\n•\nto continuously strive to operate more effectively.  \nWe promote the growth of our industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of new and existing product offerings by our vendors, the benefits and affordability of pool ownership, the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming.  These programs include digital and media advertising, industry-oriented website development such as www.swimmingpool.com®, www.hottubs.com® and www.nptpool.com®, social media platforms and other digital marketing initiatives, including our new, all-inclusive Regal and E-Z Clor Pool Care mobile apps that enable at-home water testing, as well as our NPT® Backyard mobile app.  We use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers.  We also promote the growth of our industry by offering a growing selection of energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products, which support sustainability and can help pool owners save energy, water, time and money.  Our environmentally friendly technology products include variable speed pumps, LED pool and hot tub lights and high-efficiency heat pumps.  Our Horizon sales centers offer organic fertilizers, organic pesticides, and irrigation and drainage products that reduce water usage and soil erosion, allowing our customers and homeowners to have less of an impact on freshwater reserves.\n3\nWe promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering the broadest product assortment through the largest number of conveniently located market-based sales centers and through comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales.  We provide in depth product training that allows our customers to expand the scope of their product offerings.  We also provide uniquely tailored advertising programs through our EDGE Marketing Portal that include such features as digital marketing, customer lead generation, personalized websites, brochures, direct mail, marketing campaigns and business development training.  We assist certain customers with aspects of their businesses, including site selection, store layout and design, product merchandising, comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes.  In addition to these programs, we feature consumer showrooms in many of our sales centers and host our annual Retail Summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry.  We also function as a day-to-day resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers’ unique needs.  \nIn addition to our efforts aimed at promoting industry and customer growth, we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations, which we define as capacity creation.  We create capacity with business-to-business (B2B) development tools and execution aimed at developing best-in-class service and value creation for our customers and suppliers.  In particular, our POOL360 and Horizon 24/7 B2B internet and mobile platforms help our customers be more productive by allowing them to digitally review and order our products, while leveraging our customer service staff resources, particularly during peak business periods.  These tools offer real-time integration into our enterprise resource planning system, creating efficiencies in our business processes and also provide our customers graphical catalog presentation in the same platform.  Our BlueStreak mobile ordering platform enables our sales associates to process orders faster, often eliminating the need for customers to get out of their vehicles.  Similarly, we employ velocity slotting technology and other processes to enhance the operational efficiencies of our sales centers and warehouses.  \nWe believe that ongoing investments in digital transformation and technology help us provide best-in-class service to our customers by improving the customer experience, enhancing our existing customer relationships and expanding our customer base.  To that end, a part of our growth strategy includes investing in technology that allows us to better serve our customers and using this information to make better data-driven decisions for our business.  Our POOL360 digital ecosystem is a suite of SaaS products transforming the way pool professionals do business.  POOL360 WaterTest and POOL360 PoolService are tools designed to unlock capacity for our customers and our sales center network.  By integrating e-commerce, software applications and data-driven insights, POOL360 enhances both customer experience and operational efficiency.  POOL360 WaterTest is a professional water testing software available to our retail customers that incorporates our complete line of proprietary-branded pool and hot tub chemicals into pool owners’ water chemistry maintenance requirements.  Our POOL360 PoolService mobile application allows pool professionals to better manage their service business through providing a complete Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool, routing, billing and other day-to-day management capabilities, while improving their customers’ experiences.  Each of these tools links directly into our POOL360 B2B platform, creating efficiencies for both us and our customers.  Going forward, we plan to continue growing our suite of POOL360 technologies with additional resources for our customers.\nWe have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings, acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers depending on our market presence and capacity.  For additional information regarding our new sales center openings, acquisitions and closures/consolidations, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8, Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in this Form 10-K.\nWe plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions and open new sales centers to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories.  We believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically.  Going forward, we expect to continue to realize sales growth through market share gains and continued expansion of our product offerings with a focus on our proprietary and exclusive brand products.  \nCustomers and Products\nWe serve roughly 125,000 customers, most of which are small, family-owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources.  Most of these businesses provide labor and technical services to the end consumer and operate as independent contractors and specialty retailers employing few if any employees.  These customers also buy products from other distributors, mass merchants, home stores and certain specialty and internet retailers.  No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales in 2024.\n4\nWe provide extended payment terms to qualified customers for sales under pre-season early buy programs, which typically occur during the fourth and first quarters.  The extended terms usually require payments in equal installments during the second quarter of each year.  See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Doubtful Accounts” for additional information.\nWe sell our products primarily to the following types of customers:\n•\nswimming pool remodelers and builders;\n•\nspecialty retailers that sell swimming pool supplies, including independently owned and operated Pinch A Penny franchise stores;\n•\nswimming pool repair and service businesses;\n•\nirrigation construction and landscape maintenance contractors; and\n•\ncommercial pool operators and pool contractors who build, remodel or service large commercial installations such as hotels, universities and community recreational facilities.\nWe conduct our operations through \n448\n sales centers in North America, Europe and Australia.  Our primary markets, those with the highest concentration of swimming pools, are Florida, California, Texas and Arizona, collectively representing approximately 54% of our 2024 net sales.  In 2024, we generated approximately 96% of our sales in North America (including Canada and Mexico), 4% in Europe and less than 1% in Australia.  While we continue to expand both domestically and internationally, we expect this geographic mix to be similar over the next few years.  References to product line and product category data throughout this Form 10-K generally reflect data related to our North America swimming pool market, as it is more readily available for analysis and represents the largest component of our operations.\nOur goal is to be a trusted resource for industry professionals, retailers and consumers in the outdoor living industry.  We use local sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses.  Our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer training programs and promotional activities, creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise.  Our local sales personnel work from our sales centers as trusted resources for our customers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs.  Our sales center personnel help educate our customers on a variety of topics including the newest, most innovative products and solutions that can elevate their businesses.\nWe offer our customers more than 200,000 manufacturer and proprietary and exclusive brand products.  We sell the following types of products:\n \n•\nmaintenance products, such as chemicals, supplies and pool accessories;\n•\nrepair and replacement parts for pool equipment, such as cleaners, filters, heaters, pumps and lights;\n•\nbuilding materials, such as concrete, plumbing and electrical components, both functional and decorative pool surfaces, decking materials, tile, hardscapes and natural stone, used for pool installations and remodeling; \n•\npool equipment and components for new pool construction and the remodeling and replacement of existing pools;\n•\nirrigation and related products, including irrigation system components and professional turf care equipment and supplies; \n•\ncommercial pool products, including American Society of Material Engineers-certified heaters, safety equipment, commercial decking equipment and commercial pumps and filters; \n•\nfiberglass pools and hot tubs and packaged pool kits including walls, liners, braces and coping for in-ground and above-ground pools; and \n•\nother pool construction and recreational products, which consist of a number of product categories and include discretionary recreational and related outdoor living products, such as grills and components for outdoor kitchens.\nWe believe that our selection of pool equipment, supplies, chemicals, replacement parts, irrigation and related products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry.  We currently have over 650 product lines and approximately 45 product categories.  Based on our 2024 product classifications, sales for our pool and hot tub chemicals product category represented approximately 15% of total net sales for 2024, 14% of total net sales in 2023 and 13% of total net sales in 2022.  No other product categories accounted for 10% or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years.\n5\nWe continue to identify new related product categories, and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets.  We then evaluate the performance in these markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best long-term growth potential.  We expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products, increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a company-wide basis.  \nNew product technology provides opportunities not only for improved energy-efficiency but also expanded control and convenience in enjoying leisure activities.   We offer a growing selection of energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products, which support sustainability and can help pool owners save energy, water, time and money over time.  Major equipment manufacturers have developed and will continue to develop more retrofit kits that allow homeowners to interact with their pools or hot tubs through their smartphones.  We see each of these developments as significant growth opportunities for our business.  \nOver the last several years, we have increased our product offerings and service abilities related to commercial swimming pools.  We consider the commercial market to be a key growth opportunity as we focus more attention on providing products to customers who operate and service large commercial installations such as hotels, condominiums, apartment complexes, universities and community recreational facilities.  We continue to leverage our existing sales center networks and customer and vendor relationships to grow this market.  \nIn 2024, we estimate that the sale of maintenance and minor repair products (non-discretionary) accounted for approximately 64% of our sales, while approximately 22% of our sales were derived from partially discretionary products used in the remodel, renovation and upgrading of pools, and approximately 14% of our sales were derived from discretionary products used in the construction and installation of swimming pools.  These components may vary from year to year.  \nOperating Strategy\nWe distribute swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products domestically through our SCP and Superior sales center networks and internationally through our SCP network.  We adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the U.S. swimming pool market primarily to offer our customers a choice of distinctive product selections, locations and service personnel.  We distribute irrigation, landscape maintenance and related products through our Horizon network.  \nSwimming pool tile, decking materials and interior pool surfacing products are distributed through our NPT network, as well as through SCP and Superior networks.  Our NPT network primarily serves the swimming pool market with our market-leading brand of pool tile and composite pool finish products but also provides some overlap with the irrigation and landscape industry as we offer NPT hardscapes and other outdoor living products.  As consumers create and enhance outdoor living areas and invest more in their outdoor environment, we believe we can focus our resources to address such demand by leveraging our existing pool and irrigation and landscape maintenance customer base.  We believe the development of our NPT network is a natural extension of our distribution model.  In addition to our 18 stand-alone NPT sales centers, we currently have 117 SCP and Superior sales centers that feature consumer showrooms where swimming pool and landscape contractors, as well as homeowners, can view and select pool components including pool tile, decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades.  We also offer virtual tools for homeowners to select and design their pool and outdoor environments, collaborating with their chosen contractors to install these products.  Our NPT® Backyard mobile app and \nwww.nptpool.com\n® allow our customers to virtually design, customize and view a pool in their own backyard in a short amount of time.  We believe our showrooms, local stocking of products, specialized delivery equipment and virtual support provide us with a competitive advantage in these categories.  Given the more discretionary nature of these products, this business tends to be more sensitive to external market factors compared to our business overall. \nSun Wholesale Supply distributes swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products, primarily servicing independently owned and operated Pinch A Penny franchise locations.  Since our acquisition in December 2021, we have expanded Pinch A Penny franchise operations through additional locations of Pinch A Penny franchised stores and plan to continue these expansion initiatives.  Sun Wholesale Supply also owns and operates a specialty chemical re-packaging plant providing pool chemical products to the Pinch A Penny franchised store network and a portion of the chemical products sold through our SCP and Superior networks.  \n6\nWe evaluate our sales centers based on their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures.  Our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services, such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs, real estate support services to find appropriate locations for our sales centers, human resources support, information systems support, support from our logistics and fleet teams, accounting and financial analysis support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals.  We believe our incentive programs and feedback tools, along with the competitive nature of our sales center network, stimulate and enhance the performance of our employees.\nDistribution\nOur sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations, typically in industrial, commercial or mixed-use zones.  Customers may pick up products at any sales center location, or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or third-party carriers.  For additional information on our sales centers, see Item 2, “Properties,” of this Form 10-K.\nOur sales centers generally maintain well-stocked inventories to meet our customers’ immediate needs.  We utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving, inventory control, picking, packing and shipping functions.  For additional information regarding our inventory management, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Inventory Obsolescence,” of this Form 10-K.  \nWe also operate four centralized shipping locations (CSLs) in the United States and one CSL in Europe that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or, in some cases, directly to customers.  Our CSLs are regional locations that carry a wide range of outdoor living products.  \nPurchasing and Suppliers\nWe believe we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers, who generally offer competitive pricing, return policies and promotional allowances.  It is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to manage their shipments by offering seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as Pool Corporation, which are referred to as early buy purchases.  These early buy purchases typically allow us to place orders in the fall at a modest discount, take delivery of product during the off-season months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer.\nOur preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors offering better overall terms and service to optimize profitability and shareholder return.  We also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments.  These practices, together with a more comprehensive service offering, have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments.  See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Vendor Programs,” for additional information.\nWe regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to ensure competitive cost, service and quality standards.  Our largest suppliers include Pentair plc, Zodiac Pool Systems, Inc, and Hayward Pool Products, Inc., which accounted for approximately 20%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of the cost of products we sold in 2024.\nCompetition\nWe are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products (based on industry knowledge and available data) and one of the only national wholesale distributors focused on the swimming pool industry in the United States.  We are also one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape maintenance products in the United States.  We face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from a limited number of other national wholesale distributors.  We also face competition, both directly and indirectly, from mass market retailers (both store-based and internet) and large pool supply retailers who primarily buy directly from manufacturers. \n7\nSome geographic markets we serve, particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of Florida, California, Texas and Arizona have a greater concentration of competition than others.  Barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low.  We believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply distribution are:\n•\nthe breadth and availability of products offered;\n•\nthe quality and level of customer service, including online communications and access, ease of ordering and speed of product delivery;\n•\nthe availability of sales and marketing programs;\n•\nconsistency and stability of business relationships with customers and suppliers;\n•\ncompetitive product pricing; and\n•\ngeographic proximity to the customer.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG)\nEnvironmental\nWe are committed to sustainable business practices, which includes offering energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly products to our customers, closely monitoring our sourcing activities, and being good stewards within the communities we serve.  In our operations, maximizing the efficiency of our fleet and improving the energy efficiency of our facilities help us to manage our carbon footprint.  We continually strive to ensure success in our business while protecting resources for future generations.  We also endeavor to handle, distribute, transport and dispose of our products in a responsible manner, particularly the chemicals and fertilizers that we sell.  \nSocial - Human Capital Management \nWe employed approximately 6,000 people at December 31, 2024 and approximately 90% of our employees were located in the U.S.  Given the seasonal nature of our business, our peak employment period is the summer season and, depending on expected sales levels, we add 100 to 200 employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand.  We believe that we have good relations with our employees.  None of our employees are currently covered under any collective bargaining agreements.\nOur goal is to be an Employer of Choice by focusing on the engagement, development, retention, and health and well‑being of our employees.  We believe that our success is a direct result of the contributions and commitment of our employees.  We provide competitive pay and benefits, training and continuing education, and professional development and promotional opportunities to engage and reward our team.  We have established a set of standard operating procedures to optimize our human capital management function, including recruitment and employee relations policies, training practices and operational instructions.  We focus on the following factors in implementing and developing our human capital strategy:\n•\nemployee health, safety and wellness;\n•\ntalent management; \n•\nemployee growth and development; and\n•\nemployee compensation and benefits.\nEmployee Health, Safety and Wellness\nOur commitment to the health, safety and wellness of our employees ranks at the top of our core operating priorities.  Our ultimate goal is to send every employee home each night in the same condition in which they came to work that morning.  We aim to achieve zero serious injuries through continued investment in, and focus on, our core safety programs and injury-reduction initiatives.  This effort begins immediately with new employees and is reinforced each day through a focus on training, safety awareness, risk identification and other essential safety protocols.  We closely monitor overall workers’ compensation and auto claims, OSHA recordable incidents, Department of Transportation compliance and other internally established safety prevention elements in an effort to make every workday safe.\nTalent Management\nWe value the differences in perspective and lived experience that our thousands of employees bring to work.  We understand that a talented team is strongest when there are varying viewpoints and ideas.  Our commitment to fostering a welcoming workplace goes beyond hiring; it’s about ensuring every voice is heard and valued. \n8\nWe are committed to supporting our workforce through the hiring, retention and advancement of top-tier talent through the following:\n•\nRecruiting, developing and retaining a dynamic workforce and providing developmental opportunities for career advancement for all employees; \n•\nEnsuring that our policies, practices and procedures are fair and provide equal employment opportunity for a wide range of prospective candidates and employees; and\n•\nCommunicating that we, as an Employer of Choice, are committed to a culture with action-oriented programs that produce results and employee engagement.\nTo create connection and community within our workforce, we have established a mentoring program to cultivate the growth and development of our high potential employees.  We also support our employees with training and development opportunities, which include content aimed at creating and sustaining an inclusive environment.\n \nEmployee Growth and Development \nWe strive to be an Employer of Choice by investing in our employees.  Our goal is to attract, develop and retain a talented team inspired by our mission to maintain exceptional relationships with our customers and suppliers and create exceptional return to our shareholders, while providing exceptional opportunities for our employees.  Our success depends on our employees understanding how their work contributes to the company’s overall strategy.  \nWhen our employees succeed, the company succeeds.  To help our employees achieve success in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and career development opportunities.  These opportunities include annual performance reviews, succession planning, promotion and advancement opportunities, ongoing training in safety and security protocols, updates on new products and service offerings and deployment of technologies.  We also provide a series of managerial training to our field and departmental leaders.  This coursework covers topics such as recruitment best practices, effective communications, leading and empowering others and managing employee performance.\nWe provide an entry level training program to prepare Manager Trainees (MITs) for sales and operations management opportunities and build our pipeline for field leadership.  Our MITs are hosted at either our EDGEucation Center or in a virtual classroom.  They gain valuable experience during their training program through field-based interaction with customers and operating management.  Our program includes interaction with subject matter experts, hands-on projects and role play to provide MITs with practical \nindustry knowledge, leadership skills and the tools necessary to succeed within our organization.\nOur employees are also involved in a multitude of volunteer efforts that positively impact our communities through support of charitable organizations.  Since 2021, through our partnership with YMCA’s across the country, we have provided water safety lessons for more than 42,000 underserved children and training for approximately 3,000 lifeguards.  Our local employees and partners have also donated their time and energy to make these events a success.\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\nWe strive to provide market-competitive compensation, benefits and services to our employees, and our performance-based compensation philosophy rewards each employee’s individual contributions.  Our total compensation package includes cash compensation (base salary and performance-based incentive or bonus payments), company contributions toward additional benefits (such as health and disability plans), retirement plans with a company match and paid time off.  We also offer the opportunity to become a shareholder through equity grants for certain roles and our employee stock purchase plan.  Our employees can take advantage of a range of benefits, including healthcare and wellness programs, tuition reimbursement for eligible employees and multi-year scholarships to their dependents, and financial wellness programs to help provide education and tools to assist in improving, maintaining and capitalizing on our employees’ financial future.  We closely monitor employee turnover and conduct exit interviews to gain relevant information and adapt our engagement and retention strategy as appropriate.\n9\nGovernance\nOur employees, managers and officers conduct our business under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the oversight of our Board of Directors (our Board) to enhance our long-term value for our stockholders.  The core responsibility of our Board is to exercise its fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of our company and our stockholders.  In exercising this obligation, our Board and committees perform a number of specific functions, including risk assessment, review and oversight.  While management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risk, our Board is responsible for oversight of our risk management programs, ensuring that an appropriate culture of risk management exists within the company, and assisting management in addressing specific risks, such as strategic risks, financial risks, cybersecurity risks, regulatory risks and operational risks.\nSeasonality and Weather\nOur business is seasonal.  In general, sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters, which represent the peak months of swimming pool use, pool and irrigation installation and maintenance activities.  Sales are lower during the first and fourth quarters.  In 2024, we generated approximately 60% of our net sales and 73% of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year.\nWe typically experience a build-up of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season.  Excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases, our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter, primarily because extended payment terms offered by certain of our suppliers are typically payable in April, May and June, while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in June, July and August.\nWe expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers.  Based on our peak summer selling season, we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers, when warranted, either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends.\nWeather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business.  The table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions.\nWeather\nPossible Effects\nHot and dry\n•\nIncreased purchases of chemicals and supplies\n \n \nfor existing swimming pools\n \n•\nIncreased purchases of above-ground pools and\n \n \nirrigation and lawn care products\nUnseasonably cool weather or extraordinary amounts\n•\nFewer pool and irrigation and landscaping\nof rain\ninstallations\n•\nDecreased purchases of chemicals and supplies\n•\nDecreased purchases of impulse items such as\n \n \nabove-ground pools and accessories\nUnseasonably early warming trends in spring/late cooling\n•\nA longer pool and landscape season, thus positively\ntrends in fall\nimpacting our sales\n(primarily in the northern half of the U.S. and Canada)\n \n \nUnseasonably late warming trends in spring/early cooling\n•\nA shorter pool and landscape season, thus negatively\ntrends in fall\nimpacting our sales\n(primarily in the northern half of the U.S. and Canada)\n \n \nFor discussion regarding the effects seasonality and weather had on our results of operations in 2024 and 2023, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations,” of this Form 10-K.\n10\nGovernment Regulations\nOur business is subject to a wide variety of regulations, principally under local fire codes and international, federal, state and local environmental and health and safety requirements, including regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Transportation, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Fire Protection Agency and the International Maritime Organization.  Most of these requirements govern the packaging, labeling, handling, transportation, storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers.  We store certain types of chemicals and/or fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes.  In addition, we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and various state pesticide laws.  These laws primarily relate to labeling, annual registration and licensing.\nIntellectual Property\nWe maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks and patents, primarily for our proprietary and exclusive brand products that are important to our current and future business operations.  We also own rights to numerous internet domain names.\nGeographic Areas\nSee Note 12 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for financial information about geographic areas for the past three years.  \nWebsite Access and Additional Information\nOur website is \nwww.poolcorp.com\n.

  "item7": "Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFor a discussion of our base business calculations, see the RESULTS OF OPERATIONS section below.\n2024 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW \nFinancial Results \nNet sales decreased 4% to $5.3 billion in 2024 compared to $5.5 billion in 2023.  Base business results approximated consolidated results for the year.  Maintenance activities remained stable throughout 2024, reflecting steady demand for non-discretionary products, while sales of discretionary products for new pool construction and remodeling were softer, impacted by macroeconomic conditions.  Inflationary product cost increases moderated, benefiting net sales approximately 1% to 2% in 2024, compared to 3% to 4% in 2023.\nGross profit was $1.6 billion in 2024, a 5% decrease from gross profit of $1.7 billion in 2023.  Gross margin declined 30 basis points to 29.7% in 2024 compared to 30.0% in 2023.  Pricing optimization efforts, the reversal of previously recorded estimated import taxes in the first quarter of 2024 and higher volume-related purchase incentives compared to last year benefited our current year gross margin.  These impacts were offset by a less favorable product and customer mix.\nSelling and administrative expenses (operating expenses) increased 5%, or $44.7 million, to $958.1 million in 2024.  As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased 150 basis points to 18.0% in 2024 compared to 16.5% in 2023.  Expense growth drivers included higher costs associated with the expansion of our network and our technology initiatives as well as inflationary rent, wage and insurance increases.  These increases were partially mitigated by close management of variable costs.\nOperating income for the year decreased 17% to $617.2 million, down from $746.6 million in 2023.  Operating margin decreased 190 basis points to 11.6% in 2024 compared to 13.5% in 2023.  \nInterest and other non-operating expenses, net for the year was reduced by $8.2 million compared to 2023, primarily due to lower average debt between periods.\nWe recorded an $8.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, tax benefit from Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, \nImprovements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,\n for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a tax benefit of $6.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, realized in 2023.\nNet income declined 17% to $434.3 million in 2024 compared to $523.2 million in 2023.  Earnings per share decreased 15% to $11.30 per diluted share compared to $13.35 per diluted share in 2023.  Without the impact from ASU 2016-09 in both periods, earnings per diluted share decreased 16% to $11.07 per diluted share compared to $13.18 per diluted share in 2023.  See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS below for definitions of our non-GAAP measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures.\nFinancial Position and Liquidity\nNet cash provided by operations was $659.2 million in 2024.  Our cash flows were impacted by our inventory reduction efforts in 2023 and lower net income in 2024.  These impacts were partially offset by a benefit of $68.5 million from the deferral of our third and fourth quarter estimated tax payments, subsequently paid in February 2025, as allowed for companies impacted by Hurricane Francine.  Our 2024 operating cash flows helped to fund the following initiatives:\n•\nshare repurchases including related excise tax payments, totaling $306.3 million for the year;\n•\nquarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders, totaling $179.6 million for the year; \n•\na $103.0 million debt reduction; and\n•\nnet capital expenditures and acquisitions of $64.2 million.\nTotal net receivables, including pledged receivables, decreased 8% compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower sales in 2024.  Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $8.6 million at December 31, 2024 and $11.7 million at December 31, 2023.  Our days sales outstanding ratio, as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis, was 26.3 days at December 31, 2024 and 26.8 days at December 31, 2023.\n29\nOur inventory management efforts reduced our inventory levels by 6% to $1.3 billion, compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2023, outpacing the 4% decline in net sales.  Our reserve for inventory obsolescence was $26.7 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $23.5 million at December 31, 2023.  Our inventory turns, as calculated on a trailing four quarters basis, were 2.8 times at December 31, 2024 and 2.7 times at December 31, 2023.\nTotal debt outstanding of $950.4 million at December 31, 2024 decreased $103.0 million compared to December 31, 2023 as we have used operating cash flows to reduce our debt.\nCurrent Trends and Outlook\nConsumers’ investments in their homes, including backyard renovations, continue to be favorable.  In recent years, steady increases in home values, lack of affordable new homes and increased mortgage rates have positioned homeowners to stay in their homes longer and upgrade their home environments, including their backyards.  During the COVID-19 pandemic (generally 2020 through 2022), we experienced unprecedented demand as families spent more time at home and sought opportunities to create or expand home-based outdoor living and entertainment spaces.  This trend had a positive impact on our financial performance during 2020 through 2022.  Beginning in the latter half of 2022 through 2024, these trends moderated resulting in lagging new pool construction and remodeling activities.  As a result, in 2024, we estimate that new in-ground pool construction units decreased 15% from 72,000 units in 2023 to 61,000 units, impacted by lower discretionary activities and further pressured by the macroeconomic environment.  \nMarket conditions in 2024 were challenged by generally higher than normal interest rates and product cost and labor inflation, which led to consumer hesitancy on discretionary spending and some cyclical suppression of demand.  While these market conditions impacted new pool construction and remodeling projects, our non-discretionary maintenance product sales in 2024 were not significantly impacted.  As lower housing turnover encourages consumers to renovate their existing homes, we expect that consumers will continue to invest in outdoor living spaces as they consider backyards an extension of their home space.  We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the inherent long-term growth opportunities in our industry fueled by favorable population migration trends, positive housing demand dynamics, and product developments and technological advancements as consumers focus on more sustainable and energy-efficient products.  \nIn view of current trends, we established our outlook for 2025 based on reasonable expectations for industry demand, pricing and inflationary conditions, continued capacity creation to have a positive impact on variable expenses, continued investment in our digital transformation initiatives and ongoing leverage of existing investments in our business and continuous process improvements.  We also plan to broaden our geographic presence by opening 8 to \n10\n new sales centers in 2025 and by making selective acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise. \nWe base our assumptions on normal weather conditions and do not incorporate alternative weather predictions into our guidance.  Favorable weather positively impacts industry activity by accelerating growth in any given year, expanding the number of available construction days, extending the pool season and pool usage and positively impacting demand for discretionary products.  Conversely, unfavorable weather typically impedes growth.  \nThe following summarizes our outlook for 2025:\n•\nWe expect sales to be flat to a low single digit increase compared to 2024, impacted by the following factors and assumptions:\n◦\nnormal weather patterns for 2025;\n◦\nsustained demand for pool maintenance products; \n◦\nsimilar volumes of discretionary products used for pool construction and remodeling, renovation and upgrading of pools as 2024; \n◦\ninflationary product cost increases, which generally pass through to customers of approximately 1% to 2%; and\n◦\none less selling day in the first quarter and for the full year of 2025 compared to 2024.\n•\nWe project gross margin for the full year of 2025 to be in the range of our 2024 gross margin at 29.7% and our long-term target of 30.0%, with our highest margin in the second quarter of the year.  We expect that our long-term gross margin target will be more achievable as construction trends improve.  Our actual gross margin will depend on changes in product and customer mix and on amounts and timing of sales and inflationary price increases. \n30\n•\nWe expect to leverage our existing infrastructure and strategically manage discretionary spending.  We project that our operating expenses in 2025 will be impacted by the following factors:\n◦\nan increase of approximately $15.0 million in performance-based compensation to incentivize and reward our employees;\n◦\n$10.0 million of spend for new sales centers as we further expand our sales center network;\n◦\ncontinued investment in technological solutions to enhance our customer service; and\n◦\ninflationary increases in areas such as labor and occupancy costs with some offsets from our efficiency initiatives.\nIn 2025, we expect our effective tax rate will be around 25% without the impact of ASU 2016-09.  Our effective tax rate is dependent upon our results of operations and may change if actual results are different from our current expectations.  Due to ASU 2016-09 requirements, we expect our effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, particularly in periods when employees elect to exercise their vested stock options or when restrictions on share-based awards lapse.  We estimate that we have approximately $3.2 million in unrealized excess tax benefits related to stock options that expire and restricted awards that vest in the first quarter of 2025.  We may recognize additional tax benefits related to stock option exercises in 2025 from grants that expire in years after 2025, for which we have not included any expected benefits in our guidance.  The estimated impact related to ASU 2016-09 is subject to several assumptions which can vary significantly, including our estimated share price and the period that our employees will exercise vested stock options.  We recorded an $8.8 million benefit in our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to ASU 2016-09.  \nWe project that 2025 earnings will be in the range of $11.08 to $11.58 per diluted share, including an estimated $0.08 benefit from ASU 2016-09 during the first quarter of 2025.  We expect to continue to use cash for the payment of cash dividends as and when declared by our Board and to fund opportunistic share repurchases over the next year.\nThe forward-looking statements in this Current Trends and Outlook section and elsewhere in this document are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the sensitivity of our business to weather conditions; changes in the economy, consumer discretionary spending, the housing market, inflation, or interest rates; our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers; the extent to which favorable consumer spending trends over the past several years will continue; competition from other leisure product alternatives or mass merchants; our ability to continue to execute our growth strategies; changes in the regulatory environment; new or additional taxes, duties or tariffs; excess tax benefits or deficiencies recognized under ASU 2016-09 and other risks detailed in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.  Also see “Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995” prior to the heading “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.\n31\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  \nManagement has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board.  Our critical accounting estimates are discussed below, including, to the extent material and reasonably available, the impact such estimates have had, or are reasonably likely to have, on our financial condition or results of operations. \nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments.  We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral.  Consistent with industry practices, we generally require payment from our North American customers within 30 days, except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers.  The extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in April, May and June or May and June, depending on geographic location.  Credit losses have generally been within or better than our expectations.\nSimilar to our business, our customers’ businesses are seasonal.  Sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time.  We provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on our accounts receivable aging.  These reserves range from 0.05% for amounts currently due to up to 100% for specific accounts more than 60 days past due.\nAt the end of each quarter, we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with balances greater than $20,000 and more than 60 days past due.  Additionally, we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on past due accounts.  We estimate future losses based upon historical bad debts, customer receivable balances, age of customer receivable balances, customers’ financial conditions and current and forecasted economic trends, including certain trends in the housing market, the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions (as commonly measured by Gross Domestic Product or GDP).  We monitor housing market trends through review of the House Price Index as published by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which measures the movement of single-family home prices.  \nDuring the year, we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote.  These write-offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts.  In the past five years, write-offs have averaged approximately 0.10% of net sales annually.  Write-offs as a percentage of net sales approximated 0.16% in 2024, 0.12% in 2023 and 0.08% in 2022.  We expect that write-offs will range from 0.05% to 0.10% of net sales in 2025.  \nAt the end of each fiscal year, we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior year-end allowance for doubtful accounts balance to (i) current year write-offs and (ii) any significantly aged outstanding receivable balances.  Based on our most recent hindsight analysis, we concluded that the prior year allowance was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate.\nIf the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20% at December 31, 2024, pretax income would change by approximately $1.7 million and earnings per share would change by approximately $0.03 per diluted share (based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2024).\nInventory Obsolescence\nProduct inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet.  Our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stock-outs to provide the highest level of service to our customers.  To do this, we maintain at each sales center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units (SKUs) with the highest sales volumes.  At the same time, we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory, which are not as critical to our customers and thus, inherently turn at slower rates.  \n32\nWe establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory with lower sales velocity and inventory with no sales for the past 12 months, which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence.  The reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory at net realizable value.  We have not changed our methodology from prior years.\nIn evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence, we consider a combination of factors, including:\n•\nthe level of inventory in relation to historical sales by product, including inventory usage based on product sales at both the sales center level and on a company-wide basis;\n•\nchanges in customer preferences or regulatory requirements;\n•\nseasonal fluctuations in inventory levels;\n•\ngeographic location; and\n•\nsuperseded products and new product offerings.\nWe periodically adjust our reserve for inventory obsolescence as changes occur in the above-identified factors.  At the end of each fiscal year, we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing the prior year-end obsolescence reserve balance to (i) current year inventory write-offs and (ii) the value of products with no sales for the past 12 months that remain in inventory.  Based on our most recent hindsight analysis, we concluded that our prior year reserve was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate.\nIf the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20% at December 31, 2024, pretax income would change by approximately $5.3 million and earnings per share would change by approximately $0.10 per diluted share (based on the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2024).\nVendor Programs\nMany of our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive specified amounts of consideration when we achieve any of a number of measures.  These measures generally relate to the volume level of purchases from our vendors, or our net cost of products sold, and may include negotiated pricing arrangements.  We account for vendor programs as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore a reduction of inventory until we sell the product, at which time we recognize such consideration as a reduction of cost of sales in our income statement.\nThroughout the year, we estimate the amount earned based on our expectation of total purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward the attainment of various levels within certain vendor programs.  We accrue vendor program benefits on a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are probable and reasonably estimable.  Our estimates for annual purchases, future inventory levels and sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections, which can be significantly impacted by a number of external factors including changes in economic conditions and weather.  Changes in our purchasing mix also impact our estimates, as certain program rates can vary depending on our volume of purchases from specific vendors.  \nWe continually revise these estimates throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and identifiable trends.  As a result, our estimated quarterly vendor program benefits accrual may include cumulative catch-up adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting periods.  These adjustments have a greater impact on gross margin in the fourth quarter since it is our seasonally slowest quarter and because the majority of our vendor arrangements are based on calendar year periods.  We update our estimates for these arrangements at year end to reflect actual annual purchase or sales levels.  In the first quarter of the subsequent year, we prepare a hindsight analysis by comparing actual vendor credits received to the prior year vendor receivable balances.  Based on our most recent hindsight analysis, we concluded that our vendor program estimates were within a range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodology is appropriate.\nIf market conditions were to change, vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs.  Although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to products already purchased, they may lower or raise our cost for products purchased and sold in future periods.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse.  Due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates, significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future.\n33\nWe record Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) on foreign earnings as period costs if and when incurred, although we have not realized any impacts since the December 2017 enactment of U.S. tax reform. \nAs of December 31, 2024, U.S. income taxes were not provided on the earnings or cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries, outside of the provisions of the transition tax from U.S. tax reform.  As we have historically invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely to fund current cash flow needs in the countries where held, additional income tax provisions may be required.  Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings and cash balances is not practicable due to the complexity of tax laws and regulations and the varying circumstances, tax treatments and timing of any future repatriation.  \nWe operate in 41 states, 1 United States territory and 11 foreign countries.  We are subject to regular audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities.  We recognize a benefit from an uncertain tax position only after determining it is more likely than not that the tax position will withstand examination by the applicable taxing authority.  Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental.  We regularly evaluate our tax positions and incorporate these expectations into our reserve estimates.  We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters.  However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire.  These adjustments may include changes in valuation allowances that we have established.  As a result of these uncertainties, our total income tax provision may fluctuate on a quarterly basis.\nEach year, we prepare a return to provision analysis upon filing our income tax returns.  Based on our most recent hindsight analysis, we concluded that our prior year income tax provision was within a range of acceptable estimates and that our provision calculation methodology is appropriate.  Differences between our effective income tax rate and federal and state statutory tax rates are primarily due to excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of deductible nonqualified stock options and the lapse of restrictions on deductible restricted stock awards.  \nPerformance-Based Compensation Accrual\nThe Compensation Committee of our Board (Compensation Committee) and our management have designed compensation programs intended to create a performance culture.  The primary objectives of our compensation programs are to attract, motivate, reward and retain our employees without leading to unnecessary risk taking.  Our compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to groups of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility.  The majority of our bonus plans consist of annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria.  We calculate bonuses based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results, including operating income. \nWe use an annual cash performance award (annual bonus) to focus corporate behavior on short-term goals for growth, financial performance and other specific financial and business improvement metrics.  Management sets the company’s annual bonus objectives at the beginning of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year.  Management also establishes specific business improvement objectives for both our operating units and corporate employees.  The Compensation Committee approves objectives for annual bonus plans involving executive management. \nWe have also utilized our medium-term (three-year) Strategic Plan Incentive Program (SPIP) to provide senior management with an additional cash-based, pay-for-performance award based on the achievement of specified earnings growth objectives.  Payouts through the SPIP are based on three-year compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) of our diluted EPS.  Beginning in 2023, our Compensation Committee did not grant any awards under the SPIP.  \nWe record annual performance-based compensation accruals based on operating income achieved in a quarter as a percentage of total expected operating income for the year.  We estimate total expected operating income for the current plan year using management’s estimate of the total overall incentives earned per the stated bonus plan objectives.  Starting in June, and continuing each quarter through our fiscal year end, we adjust our estimated performance-based compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan, the participants’ progress toward achievement of their specific objectives and management’s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans, if any.\nOur quarterly performance-based compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts due to differences between estimated and actual performance and the discretionary components of the bonus plans.\n34\nWe generally make bonus payments at the end of February following the most recently completed fiscal year.  Each year, we compare the actual bonus payouts to amounts accrued at the previous year’s end to determine the accuracy of our performance-based compensation estimates.  Based on our most recent hindsight analysis, we concluded that our performance-based compensation accrual balances were within a reasonable range of acceptable estimates and that our estimation methodologies are appropriate.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is our largest intangible asset.  At December 31, 2024, our goodwill balance was $698.9 million, representing approximately 21% of total assets.  Goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed.\nWe perform a goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or on a more frequent basis if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate potential impairment.  We have the option of first analyzing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  When a qualitative goodwill test is performed, we analyze factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.  The evaluation of qualitative factors includes an assessment of relevant facts, events and circumstances including but not limited to: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and the current and forecasted financial performance of the reporting unit.  In combination with our qualitative test, we also estimate the fair value of our reporting units by projecting company-wide future cash flows using management’s assumptions for sales growth rates, operating margins and discount rates.  Estimated earnings multiples are then used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit.  These estimates can significantly affect the outcome of our impairment test.  \nTo the extent our qualitative test indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount or for any reporting unit where we only perform a quantitative test, we perform a discounted cash flow analysis at the reporting unit level to further evaluate our initial fair value estimate.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, we record a goodwill impairment charge for the difference, up to the carrying value of the goodwill.  The fair value estimates used in our impairment test are determined using discounted cash flow models, which require the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement.  Since we define an operating segment as an individual sales center and we do not have operations below the sales center level, we define a reporting unit as an individual sales center.  \nTo test the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, we compared our company-wide estimated fair value to our market capitalization as of the date of our annual impairment test.  In 2024, our company-wide estimated fair value was in line with our market capitalization.  To facilitate a sensitivity analysis, we reduced our consolidated fair value estimate to reflect more conservative discounted cash flow assumptions, the sensitivity of a 150 basis point increase in our estimated weighted average cost of capital or a 50 basis point decrease in the estimated perpetuity growth rate.  Our sensitivity analysis resulted in a fair value modestly lower than our market capitalization and did not result in the identification of additional at-risk locations.\nIf our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if operating results are less than forecasted, we could incur impairment charges in future periods.  Impairment charges would decrease operating income, negatively impact diluted EPS and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.  \nIn October 2024, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not record any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level.  As of October 1, 2024, we had 251 reporting units with allocated goodwill balances.  Our most significant goodwill balance of $401.6 million was related to our Porpoise Pool & Patio reporting unit and the next largest goodwill balance for a reporting unit was $12.1 million.  The average goodwill balance per reporting unit was $2.8 million.  \nIn September 2023, we recorded goodwill impairment of $0.6 million, primarily related to one of our Horizon reporting units in Texas that we previously identified as being most at risk of goodwill impairment.  We had been monitoring this location’s results, which came in below expectations at the end of the 2023 season.  We performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis, which included a discounted cash flow analysis, and determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit no longer exceeded its carrying value.  Following this, in October 2023, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and did not recognize any goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level.  \nIn October 2022, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded goodwill impairment of $0.6 million related to the closure of a Horizon reporting unit in that period.\n35\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for details.\n36\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe table below summarizes information derived from our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal years: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet sales\n100.0\n \n%\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nCost of sales\n70.3\n \n70.0 \n68.7 \nGross profit\n29.7\n \n30.0 \n31.3 \nOperating expenses\n18.0\n \n16.5 \n14.7 \nOperating income\n11.6\n \n13.5 \n16.6 \nInterest and other non-operating expenses, net\n0.9\n \n1.1 \n0.7 \nIncome before income taxes and equity in earnings\n10.7\n \n%\n12.4 \n%\n15.9 \n%\nNote: Due to rounding, percentages may not add to operating income or income before income taxes and equity in earnings.\nOur discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in 2024, 2023 and 2022.  We have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates.\nFiscal Year 2024 compared to Fiscal Year 2023 \nBase Business\nWhen calculating our base business results, we exclude for a period of 15 months sales centers that are acquired, opened in new markets or closed.  We also exclude consolidated sales centers when we do not expect to maintain the majority of the existing business and existing sales centers that we consolidate with acquired sales centers.\nWe generally allocate corporate overhead expenses to excluded sales centers on the basis of their net sales as a percentage of total net sales.  After 15 months, we include acquired, consolidated and new market sales centers in the base business calculation including the comparative prior year period.\nWe have not provided separate base business income statements within this Form 10-K as base business results closely approximated consolidated results.  Acquired and new market sales centers excluded from base business contributed less than 1% to the change in net sales.  \nThe table below summarizes the changes in our sales center count during 2024:\nDecember 31, 2023\n439 \nAcquired locations\n2 \nNew locations\n10 \nClosed/consolidated locations\n(3)\nDecember 31, 2024\n448 \nFor information about our recent acquisitions, see Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n37\nNet Sales\n(in millions)\nYear Ended December 31,\n  \n2024\n2023\nChange\nNet sales\n$\n5,311.0\n \n$\n5,541.6 \n$\n(230.6)\n(4)%\nNet sales in 2024 declined 4% compared to 2023.  During 2024, maintenance activities were stable, reflecting steady demand for non-discretionary products, while sales volumes for discretionary products declined, impacted by unfavorable macroeconomic conditions. \nThe following factors impacted our sales during the year and are listed in order of estimated magnitude:\n•\nlower sales volumes due to a decline in discretionary products used in new pool construction and renovation projects (see discussion below);\n•\nstability from maintenance-related revenues, evidenced by 2% sales growth in chemicals compared to 2023, which represented 15% of our net sales; and\n•\na benefit of approximately 1% to 2% from inflationary product cost increases.\nIn 2024, sales of equipment, which is used across maintenance, renovation and new pool construction and includes swimming pool heaters, pumps, lights, filters and automation, were flat compared to 2023 and represented approximately 31% of net sales in 2024.  Sales of building materials fell 10% compared to 2023 and represented approximately 12% of net sales in 2024.  \nSales to specialty retailers that sell swimming pool supplies and customers who service large commercial installations are included in the appropriate existing product categories, and growth in these areas is reflected in the discussion above.  In 2024, sales to retail customers decreased 4% compared to 2023 and represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net sales.  Sales to commercial customers increased 9% compared to 2023 and represented approximately 5% of our consolidated net sales in 2024.    \n2024 Quarterly Sales Performance Compared to 2023 Quarterly Sales Performance\nQuarter\n2024\nFirst\nSecond\nThird\nFourth\nNet Sales Decline\n(7)%\n(5)%\n(3)%\n(2)%\n•\nIn the first quarter of 2024, net sales were affected by lower sales volumes due to reduced pool construction and discretionary activity.  Unfavorable weather conditions further reduced sales by approximately 2%.  Net sales benefited from a greater concentration of customer early buys and approximately 1% to 2% from inflationary product cost increases, net of price deflation, compared to an inflationary benefit of 4% to 5% in the first quarter of 2023.\n•\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, maintenance-related revenues remained stable, with chemical sales growing 1% compared to the second quarter of 2023, representing 15% of net sales.  Net sales were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes due to reduced pool construction and discretionary activities.  Sales benefited approximately 1% from inflationary product cost increases, net of price deflation, which was lower than the 3% to 4% benefit observed in the second quarter of 2023.\n•\nNet sales in the third quarter of 2024 were supported by steady demand for maintenance products while the discretionary portions of our business continued to see pressure resulting in lower sales volumes due to a decline in pool construction and discretionary spending.  The third quarter of 2024 benefited approximately 2% from an additional selling day compared to the same period in 2023.  \n•\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, lower sales during this seasonally slower period were impacted by weaker spending on discretionary products and solid performance in maintenance-related sales. \nIn addition to the sales discussion above, see further details of significant weather impacts under the subheading \nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations\n below.\n38\nGross Profit\n(in millions)\nYear Ended December 31,\n  \n2024\n2023\nChange\nGross profit\n$\n1,575.3\n \n$\n1,660.0 \n$\n(84.7)\n(5)%\nGross margin\n29.7\n \n%\n30.0 \n%\n \n \nGross margin declined 30 basis points to 29.7% in 2024 compared to 30.0% in 2023, impacted by:\n•\nhigher inventory costs in 2024 as we were carrying a significant amount of lower cost strategically-purchased inventory in the beginning of 2023 that was successfully reduced to normalized levels by the end of 2023 and had an unfavorable impact on 2024; and\n•\nless favorable product and customer mix.\nA $12.6 million reversal of previously recorded estimated import taxes in the first quarter of 2024 increased gross margin by 20 basis points.  Gross margin also benefited from our margin initiatives, such as increased sales of higher margin private-label chemicals, and higher levels of vendor incentives earned versus 2023 due to increased purchasing as compared to the prior year when we were actively reducing inventory levels.\nOperating Expenses\n(in millions)\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\nSelling and administrative expenses\n$\n958.1\n \n$\n913.5 \n$\n44.6 \n5%\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales\n18.0\n \n%\n16.5 \n%\n \n \nOperating expenses increased 5%, or $44.6 million, to $958.1 million in 2024, up from $913.5 million in 2023.  The primary drivers of expense growth were higher costs associated with the expansion of our network and our technology initiatives as well as inflationary rent, wage and insurance increases.  These increases were partially mitigated through close management of our variable costs and lower performance-based compensation.\nInterest and Other Non-operating Expenses, net\nInterest and other non-operating expenses, net decreased $8.2 million compared to 2023, primarily due to a decrease in average debt between periods.  Our weighted average effective interest rate was 5.2% in 2024 and 2023 on average outstanding debt of $956.3 million in 2024 versus $1.1 billion in 2023.  \nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 23.4% at December 31, 2024 and 24.0% at December 31, 2023.  We recorded a $8.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, benefit from ASU 2016-09 for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a benefit of $6.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, realized in 2023.  Without the benefits from ASU 2016-09, our effective tax rate was 25.0% for both the years ended 2024 and 2023.\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share\nNet income decreased 17% to $434.3 million in 2024 compared to $523.2 million in 2023.  Earnings per share decreased 15% to $11.30 per diluted share compared to $13.35 per diluted share in 2023.  \n39\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe non-GAAP measures described below should be considered in the context of all of our other disclosures in this Form 10-K.\nAdjusted Diluted EPS\nWe have included adjusted diluted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental disclosure, because we believe this measure is useful to management, investors and others in assessing our year-over-year operating performance.  \nAdjusted diluted EPS is a key measure used by management to demonstrate the impact of tax benefits from ASU 2016-09 on our diluted EPS and to provide investors and others with additional information about our potential future operating performance to supplement GAAP measures.\nWe believe this measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, diluted EPS presented in accordance with GAAP, and in the context of our other disclosures in this Form 10-K.  Other companies may calculate this non-GAAP financial measure differently than we do, which may limit its usefulness as a comparative measure.  \nThe table below presents a reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS. \n(Unaudited)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nDiluted EPS\n$\n11.30\n \n$\n13.35\n \nLess: ASU 2016-09 tax benefit\n0.23\n \n0.17 \nAdjusted diluted EPS \n$\n11.07\n \n$\n13.18 \nFiscal Year 2023 compared to Fiscal Year 2022 \nFor a detailed discussion of the Results of Operations in Fiscal Year 2023 compared to Fiscal Year 2022, see the Results of Operations section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis included in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \n40\nSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations\nFor discussion regarding the effects seasonality and weather have on our business, see Item 1, “Business,” of this Form 10-K.\nThe following table presents certain unaudited quarterly included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts.  We believe this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data.  Due to the seasonal nature of our industry, the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends, including the impact of new and acquired sales centers.\n(Unaudited)\nQUARTER\n(in thousands)\n2024\n2023\n \nFirst\nSecond\nThird\nFourth\nFirst \nSecond \nThird \nFourth\nStatement of Income Data\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet sales\n1,120,810\n1,769,784\n1,432,879\n987,480\n1,206,774\n1,857,363\n1,474,407\n1,003,050\nGross profit\n338,560\n530,141\n416,403\n290,244\n369,755\n567,783\n428,731\n293,775\nOperating income\n108,720\n271,481\n176,353\n60,651\n145,771\n327,009\n194,443\n79,344\nNet income\n78,885\n192,439\n125,701\n37,300\n101,699\n232,250\n137,843\n51,437\nNet sales as a % of annual net sales\n21%\n33%\n27%\n19%\n22%\n34%\n27%\n18%\nGross profit as a % of annual gross profit\n21%\n34%\n26%\n18%\n22%\n34%\n26%\n18%\nOperating income as a % of annual operating income\n18%\n44%\n29%\n10%\n20%\n44%\n26%\n11%\nBalance Sheet Data\nTotal receivables, net\n527,175\n577,529\n425,693\n314,861\n564,171\n630,950\n461,582\n342,910\nProduct inventories, net\n1,496,947\n1,295,600\n1,180,491\n1,289,300\n1,686,683\n1,392,886\n1,259,308\n1,365,466\nAccounts payable\n907,806\n515,645\n401,702\n525,235\n739,749\n485,099\n429,436\n508,672\nTotal debt\n979,177\n1,116,553\n923,829\n950,356\n1,365,750\n1,184,586\n1,033,897\n1,053,320\n \nNote: Due to rounding, the sum of quarterly percentage amounts may not equal 100%.\nWeather Impacts on Fiscal Year 2024 to Fiscal Year 2023 Comparisons\nThe first quarter of 2024 was the tenth wettest first quarter on national record leading to mixed impacts across our markets, particularly in the month of March, which is seasonally our highest sales month of the first quarter.  However, we also observed above-average temperatures during the quarter contributing positively to economic activities in many regions, such as improvement in California during March.  The adverse effects of cooler and wetter weather in Florida and the Southeast compared to the first quarter of last year and excessive precipitation in Texas and the Northeast outweighed the positives, resulting in an unfavorable net impact on net sales.  In the first quarter of 2023, varied weather conditions had a more pronounced unfavorable impact on net sales due to unusually wet and cold weather in the western U.S., particularly California and Arizona.  This wet and cold weather was partially offset by generally favorable conditions in our southern markets, where sales benefited from warmer weather and below-average precipitation.\nThe second quarter of 2024 was marked by precipitation variability across the U.S. with wetter conditions in the central U.S. and Texas and below average precipitation in the western U.S.  Maintenance activities benefited from warmer-than-average temperatures across most regions, particularly in June.  Overall, mixed weather conditions led to varied impacts across our markets.  In contrast, weather conditions in the second quarter of 2023 unfavorably impacted sales due to cooler temperatures across the West through the mid-Atlantic region and the impact of wildfires in Canada. \nThe third quarter of 2024 saw a mix of weather conditions across the continental U.S.  Several regions faced notable weather events during the quarter.  Tropical weather brought localized flooding and heavy rainfall particularly to the coastal areas of \n41\nFlorida, Louisiana and the Carolinas.  Wetter conditions and cooler temperatures in July of 2024, compared to July of 2023, impacted maintenance activities in Texas, a key market, during a prominent selling month.  The Northeast and Midwest regions experienced generally warm and dry conditions throughout the quarter, which was favorable for pool-related activities.  The West, particularly in California, continued its trend of above-average temperatures and dry conditions, which supported outdoor and construction activities.  Collectively, weather conditions in the third quarter of 2024 had a relatively neutral impact on the overall business. Similarly, in the third quarter of 2023, hot temperatures across the southern United States were offset by rainy conditions in the Northeast, resulting in a fairly neutral impact on our business. \nRepair and replacement activity following Hurricanes Helene and Milton provided some weather-related benefits to Florida’s fourth quarter results, contributing to an increase in consolidated sales of approximately 1%.  The fourth quarter of 2024 was warmer than average with low precipitation across the country.  October 2024 was one of the warmest and driest months on record while November provided some relief with above average precipitation levels in the Midwest.  December was consistent with observed trends with both above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation.  Excluding Florida, the fourth quarter of 2024 was comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023 which had overall warm weather conditions. \nWeather Impacts on Fiscal Year 2023 to Fiscal Year 2022 Comparisons\nFor a detailed discussion of Weather Impacts on Fiscal Year 2023 compared to Fiscal Year 2022, see the Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis included in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \nGeographic Areas\nSince all of our sales centers have similar operations and share similar economic characteristics, we aggregate our sales centers into a single reportable segment.  For additional details, see Note 1 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  \nFor a breakdown of net sales and property, plant and equipment between our United States and international operations, see Item 1, “Business,” of this Form 10-K.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet short-term and long-term cash needs.  We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities, taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business.  Significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following: \n•\ncash flows generated from operating activities;\n•\nthe adequacy of available bank lines of credit;\n•\nthe quality of our receivables;\n•\nacquisitions;\n•\ndividend payments;\n•\ncapital expenditures;\n•\nchanges in income tax laws and regulations; \n•\nthe timing and extent of share repurchases; and\n•\nthe ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.\nOur primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations, debt repayment obligations and other general corporate initiatives, including acquisitions, opening new sales centers, technology-related investments, dividend payments and share repurchases.  Our primary working capital obligations are for the purchase of inventory, payroll, rent, other facility costs and selling and administrative expenses.  Our working capital obligations fluctuate during the year, driven primarily by seasonality and the timing of inventory purchases.  Our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings, which have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance acquisitions.  We have funded our capital expenditures and share repurchases in substantially the same manner.\n42\nWe prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business, maintaining a prudent capital structure, including a modest amount of debt, and returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  Our specific priorities for the use of cash are as follows:\n•\ncapital expenditures primarily for maintenance and growth of our sales center network, technology-related investments and fleet vehicles;\n•\ninventory and other operating expenses;\n•\nstrategic acquisitions executed opportunistically; \n•\npayment of cash dividends as and when declared by our Board;\n•\nrepayment of debt to maintain an average total target leverage ratio (as defined below) between 1.5 and 2.0; and\n•\ndiscretionary repurchases of our common stock under our Board authorized share repurchase program.\nWe focus our capital expenditure plans based on the needs of our existing sales centers and the opening of new sales centers.  Our capital spending primarily relates to leasehold improvements, delivery and service vehicles and information technology.  In recent years, we have increased our investment in technology and automation enabling us to operate more efficiently and better serve our customers.  \nHistorically, our capital expenditures have averaged roughly 1.0% of net sales.  Capital expenditures were 1.1% of net sales in 2024, 1.1% of net sales in 2023 and 0.7% in 2022.  In 2022, our capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales were lower than our historical average due to significant sales growth in that year.  Based on management’s current plans, we project capital expenditures for 2025 will average 1% to 1.5% of net sales.  \nWe believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and the current capacity to finance any working capital needs that may arise.  We continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates.  If suitable acquisition opportunities arise that would require financing, we believe that we have the ability to finance any such transactions.\nAs of February 20, 2025, $336.8 million remained available to purchase shares of our common stock under our current Board-approved share repurchase plan program.  We expect to repurchase additional shares in the open market from time to time depending on market conditions.  We plan to fund these repurchases with cash provided by operations and borrowings under our credit and receivables facilities described below.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows (in thousands):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nOperating activities\n$\n659,186\n \n$\n888,229 \nInvesting activities\n(66,169)\n(71,597)\nFinancing activities\n(576,550)\n(798,132)\nCash provided by operations of $659.2 million for 2024 decreased $229.0 million compared to 2023.  This decline was primarily driven by our inventory reduction efforts in prior year and lower net income in 2024.  These impacts were partially offset by a benefit from the hurricane relief deferral of our third and fourth quarter estimated tax payments totaling $68.5 million.  \nCash used in investing activities decreased $5.4 million to $66.2 million in 2024, primarily reflecting a decrease of $6.8 million in payments for acquisitions compared to 2023. \nCash used in financing activities decreased to $576.6 million in 2024 compared to $798.1 million in 2023.  The change in financing activities primarily reflects a $232.4 million decrease in net debt payments, partially offset by an increase in dividends paid of $12.2 million. \nFor a discussion of our sources and uses of cash in 2022, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources – Sources and Uses of Cash section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis included in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n43\nFuture Sources and Uses of Cash\nTo supplement cash from operations as our primary source of working capital, we will continue to utilize our three major credit facilities, which are the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility (the Credit Facility), the Term Facility (the Term Facility) and the Receivables Securitization Facility (the Receivables Facility).  For additional details regarding these facilities, see the summary descriptions below and more complete descriptions in Note 5 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  \nCredit Facility\nOur Credit Facility, as amended, provides for $1.3 billion in borrowing capacity consisting of a $800.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility and a $500.0 million term loan facility.  The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature permitting us to request one or more incremental term loans or revolving credit family commitment increases up to $250.0 million and sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit.  We pay interest on revolving and term loan borrowings under the Credit Facility at a variable rate based on the one-month Term secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), plus an applicable margin.  The term loan requires quarterly amortization payments with all remaining principal due on the term loan maturity date of September 25, 2026.  The revolving credit facility matures on September 30, 2029.  We intend to continue to use the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, for future share repurchases and to fund future growth initiatives.\nAt December 31, 2024, there was $657.1 million outstanding, including a $462.5 million term loan, with a $15.1 million standby letter of credit outstanding and $590.3 million available for borrowing under the Credit Facility.  The weighted average effective interest rate for the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024 was approximately 4.0%, excluding commitment fees and including the impact of our interest rate swaps.\nTerm Facility\nOur Term Facility provides for $185.0 million in borrowing capacity and matures on December 30, 2026.  Proceeds from the Term Facility were used to pay down the Credit Facility in December 2019, adding borrowing capacity for future share repurchases, acquisitions and growth-oriented working capital expansion.  We pay interest on borrowings under the Term Facility at a variable rate based on one month Term SOFR, plus an applicable margin.  The Term Facility is repaid in quarterly installments of 1.250% of the Term Facility on the last business day of each quarter beginning in the first quarter of 2020 with the final principal repayment due on the maturity date.  We may prepay amounts outstanding under the Term Facility without penalty other than interest breakage costs.  In June 2023, we made a prepayment on the Term Facility of $45.0 million with $32.4 million applied against the remaining quarterly installments and the remainder applied against the amount due at maturity.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Term Facility had an outstanding balance of $109.9 million at a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.6%.  \nReceivables Securitization Facility\nOur two-year accounts receivable securitization facility (the Receivables Facility) offers us a lower-cost form of financing and was recently amended on October 31, 2024. As amended, under this facility, we can borrow up to $375.0 million between April through May and from $210.0 million to $350.0 million during the remaining months of the year.  We pay interest on borrowings under the Receivables Facility at a variable rate based on one month Term SOFR, plus an applicable margin.  The Receivables Facility matures on October 30, 2026. \nThe Receivables Facility provides for the sale of certain of our receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary (the Securitization Subsidiary).  The Securitization Subsidiary transfers variable undivided percentage interests in the receivables and related rights to certain third-party financial institutions in exchange for cash proceeds, limited to the applicable funding capacities.  Upon payment of the receivables by customers, rather than remitting to the financial institutions the amounts collected, we retain such collections as proceeds for the sale of new receivables until payments become due.  \nAt December 31, 2024, there was $174.1 million outstanding under the Receivables Facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.3%, excluding commitment fees.  \n44\nFinancial Covenants\nFinancial covenants of the Credit Facility, Term Facility and Receivables Facility include maintenance of a maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which are our most restrictive financial covenants.  As of December 31, 2024, the calculations of these two covenants are detailed below:\n•\nMaximum Average Total Leverage Ratio\n. On the last day of each fiscal quarter, our average total leverage ratio must be less than 3.25 to 1.00.  Average Total Leverage Ratio is the ratio of the sum of (i) Total Non-Revolving Funded Indebtedness as of such date, (ii) the trailing twelve months (TTM) Average Total Revolving Funded Indebtedness and (iii) the TTM Average Accounts Securitization Proceeds divided by TTM EBITDA (as those terms are defined in the Credit Facility).  As of December 31, 2024, our average total leverage ratio equaled 1.42 (compared to 1.39 as of December 31, 2023) and the TTM average total indebtedness amount used in this calculation was $970.1 million.\n•\nMinimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio\n. On the last day of each fiscal quarter, our fixed charge ratio must be greater than or equal to 2.25 to 1.00.  Fixed Charge Ratio is the ratio of the TTM EBITDAR divided by TTM Interest Expense paid or payable in cash plus TTM Rental Expense (as those terms are defined in the Credit Facility).  As of December 31, 2024, our fixed charge ratio equaled 5.07 (compared to 5.94 as of December 31, 2023) and TTM Rental Expense was $104.0 million.\nThe Credit Facility and Term Facility limit the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock to a manner consistent with past practice, provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would result from the payment of dividends.  We may declare and pay quarterly dividends so long as (i) the amount per share of such dividends is not greater than the most recently publicly announced dividends per share and (ii) our Average Total Leverage Ratio is less than 3.25 to 1.00 both immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to such dividends. Under the Credit Facility and Term Facility, we may repurchase shares of our common stock provided no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would result from the repurchase of shares, and our maximum average total leverage ratio (determined on a pro forma basis) is less than 3.25 to 1.00.  \nOther covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens, incur indebtedness, make investments, merge or consolidate, and sell or transfer assets.  Failure to comply with any of our financial covenants or any other terms of the Credit Facility and the Term Facility could result in higher interest rates on our borrowings or the acceleration of the maturities of our outstanding debt.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nWe utilize interest rate swap contracts and forward-starting interest rate swap contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest payments on our variable rate borrowings.  Interest expense related to the notional amounts under all swap contracts is based on applicable fixed rates plus the applicable margin on the respective borrowings. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had two interest rate swap contracts in place and one forward-starting interest rate swap contract, each of which has the effect of converting our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our variable rate borrowings to fixed interest rates.  For more information, see Note 5 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCompliance and Future Availability\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements under our Credit Facility, our Term Facility and our Receivables Facility.  We believe we will remain in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements throughout 2025.  For additional information regarding our debt arrangements, see Note 5 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFuture Obligations\nWe have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes.  Changes in our business needs, fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from our estimates.  We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments.  The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2024 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods.  We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash, cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings on our facilities and proceeds from any future refinancing transactions.  \n45\n \n \n \nPayments Due by Period\nTotal\nLess than\n1 year\n1-3 years\n3-5 years\nMore than\n5 years\nLong-term debt\n$\n953,111\n \n$\n49,473 \n$\n709,038 \n$\n194,600 \n$\n— \nOperating leases\n365,467\n \n98,746 \n156,104 \n75,305 \n35,312 \nPurchase obligations\n2,652\n \n1,326 \n1,326 \n— \n— \n \n$\n1,321,230\n \n$\n149,545 \n$\n866,468 \n$\n269,905 \n$\n35,312 \nThe significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:\n•\nLong-term debt amounts represent only the future principal payments on our debt as of December 31, 2024.  Estimates of interest payable on this debt is separately reflected in the table appearing below.  For additional information regarding our debt arrangements, see Note 5 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n•\nOperating lease amounts include future rental payments for our operating leases.  The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases.  For additional information regarding our operating leases, see Note 9 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. \n•\nPurchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases and software commitments.  We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancellable by their terms.  We do not consider our cancellable purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. \nFor certain of our future obligations, such as unrecognized tax benefits, uncertainties exist regarding the timing of future payments and the amount by which these potential obligations will increase or decrease over time.  As such, we have excluded unrecognized tax benefits from the table above.  See Note 7 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion related to our unrecognized tax benefits.  The table also excludes various other liabilities that are not contractual in nature, including contingent liabilities, litigation accruals and contract termination fees.\nThe table below contains estimated interest payments (in thousands) related to our long-term debt obligations presented in the table above.  We calculated estimates of future interest payments based on the December 31, 2024 outstanding debt balances, using the fixed rates under our interest rate swap agreements for the applicable notional amounts and the weighted average effective interest rates as of December 31, 2024 for the remaining outstanding balances not covered by our swap contracts.  To project the estimated interest expense to coincide with the time periods used in the table above, we projected the estimated debt balances for future years based on the scheduled maturity dates of the Credit Facility, the Term Facility and the Receivables Facility.  Our actual interest payments could vary substantially from the amounts projected.\n \n \nEstimated Interest Payments Due by Period\nTotal\nLess than\n1 year\n1-3 years\n3-5 years\nMore than\n5 years\nInterest\n$\n94,266\n \n$\n34,690 \n$\n40,849 \n$\n18,727 \n$\n— \n46",
