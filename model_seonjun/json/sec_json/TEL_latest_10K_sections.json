As a trusted innovation partner, our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions enable the distribution of power, signal, and data to advance next-generation transportation, energy networks, automated factories, data centers enabling artificial intelligence, and more. References in this report to “TE Connectivity,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to TE Connectivity Ltd. before September 30, 2024 and to TE Connectivity plc on or after September 30, 2024.\nWe became an independent, publicly traded company in 2007; however, through our predecessor companies, we trace our foundations in the connectivity business back to 1941.\nDuring fiscal 2024, our board of directors and shareholders approved a change in our jurisdiction of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. In connection with the change, TE Connectivity Ltd., our former parent entity, entered into a merger agreement with TE Connectivity plc, its then wholly-owned subsidiary and a public limited company incorporated under Irish law. Under the merger agreement, TE Connectivity Ltd. merged with and into TE Connectivity plc, which was the surviving entity, in order to effect our change in jurisdiction of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. The merger was completed on September 30, 2024, thereby changing our jurisdiction of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. Effective for fiscal 2025, we are organized under the laws of Ireland. We have not had and do not anticipate any material changes in our operations or financial results as a result of the merger and change in place of incorporation. \nWe acquired Richard Manufacturing Co. (“Richards Manufacturing”) in fiscal 2025. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisition.\nWe have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Friday of September. Fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 ended on September 26, 2025, September 27, 2024, and September 29, 2023, respectively. Fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 were each 52 weeks in length. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth fiscal quarter includes 14 weeks, with the next occurrence taking place in fiscal 2028.\nSegments\nEffective for fiscal 2025, we reorganized our management and segments to align the organization around our current strategy. Prior period segment results have been recast to conform to the new segment structure. See additional information regarding our segments in Notes 1 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe now operate through two reportable segments: Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions. We believe our two segments served a combined market of approximately $200 billion as of fiscal year end 2025.\nOur net sales by segment as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFiscal\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2025\n    \n    \n2024\n    \n    \n2023\n    \n    \nTransportation Solutions\n \n 54\n%  \n​\n 60\n%  \n​\n 60\n%\n​\nIndustrial Solutions\n \n 46\n \n​\n 40\n \n​\n 40\n​\n​\nTotal\n \n 100\n%  \n​\n 100\n%  \n​\n 100\n%\n​\nBelow is a description of our reportable segments and the primary products, markets, and competitors of each segment.\n1\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTransportation Solutions\nThe Transportation Solutions segment is a leader in connectivity and sensor technologies.

We specialize in the design and manufacture of advanced surgical, imaging, and interventional device solutions. Key markets served include cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, structural heart, endoscopy, electrophysiology, and neurovascular therapies.\nThe Industrial Solutions segment competes primarily against Amphenol, Hubbell, Carlisle Companies, Integer Holdings, Molex, Omron, JST, and Korea Electric Terminal (KET).\nCustomers\nAs an industry leader, we have established close working relationships with many of our customers. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products.\nOur approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support. We believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate, our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers.\nWe manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors.\nNo single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2025, 2024, or 2023.\nSales and Distribution\nWe maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate. Our net sales by geographic region\n(1) \nas a percentage of our total net sales were as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFiscal\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2025\n    \n    \n2024\n    \n    \n2023\n    \n    \nAsia–Pacific\n \n 38\n%  \n​\n 34\n%  \n​\n 32\n%\n​\nEurope/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”)\n \n 33\n​\n​\n 37\n​\n​\n 39\n​\n​\nAmericas\n \n 29\n \n​\n 29\n \n​\n 29\n​\n​\nTotal\n \n 100\n%  \n​\n 100\n%  \n​\n 100\n%\n​\n(1)\nNet sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale.\nWe sell our products into approximately 130 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers. In fiscal 2025, our direct sales represented approximately 75% of total net sales. We also sell our products indirectly via third-party distributors.\nWe maintain distribution centers around the world. Products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, however, products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. Our global coverage positions us near our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road, rail, sea, and air. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile.\n3\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSeasonality and Backlog\nTypically, we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are usually the strongest quarters of our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets.\nCertain of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases.\nCustomer orders and demand may fluctuate as a result of economic and market conditions. Backlog by reportable segment was as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFiscal Year End\n \n​\n    \n2025\n    \n2024\n    \n​\n \n(in millions)\n​\nTransportation Solutions\n​\n$\n 2,278\n​\n$\n 2,478\n​\nIndustrial Solutions\n​\n \n 3,910\n​\n \n 3,561\n​\nTotal\n​\n$\n 6,188\n​\n$\n 6,039\n​\nWe expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2025 will be filled during fiscal 2026. Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods.\nCompetition\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers. Competition is generally based on breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, and service. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, downward pressure on prices. However, as a result of increased costs and tariffs, certain of our businesses implemented price increases in recent years.\nRaw Materials\nWe use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding; precious metals such as gold, silver, and palladium for plating; and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, trade wars, and inflationary cost pressures.\nIntellectual Property\nPatents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.\nWe own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.\nWhile we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents.\n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital Management\nWe have employees located throughout the world. As of fiscal year end 2025, we employed approximately 93,000 people worldwide, including 13,000 contract employees. Approximately 34,000 were in the Asia–Pacific region, 34,000 were in the EMEA region, and 25,000 were in the Americas region. Of our total employees, approximately 55,000 were employed in manufacturing. Our strong employee base, along with their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our success. \nWe are governed by our core values of integrity, accountability, inclusion, teamwork, and innovation. They guide our decisions and our actions, both individually and as an organization. Additionally, our employees are responsible for upholding our purpose—to create a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. We track and report internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics, critical role pipeline data, global diversity data, and engagement and inclusion indices. As part of its charter, the management development and compensation committee of our board of directors oversees our policies and practices related to the management of human capital resources including talent management, culture, global diversity, and inclusion. \nInclusion\nWe are committed to leveraging the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences, and building a workforce and supplier network that represents our global markets and the customers we serve. We strive to maintain a work environment where all employees are engaged, feel their differences are valued and mutually-respected, and believe that all opinions count. Our people reflect our customers and markets. Our employees work in over 50 countries and represent approximately 150 nationalities, and our total employee population is over 40% women. \nOur employee resource groups (“ERGs”) are company-sponsored, employee-led groups that focus on shared identities or experiences of employees. These groups apply those perspectives to create value for our company as a whole. The ERGs provide a space where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment. As of fiscal year end 2025, we had eight ERGs—African Heritage, ALIGN (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer employees (LGBTQ+) and their allies), Asian Heritage, Latin Heritage, TE Veterans, TE Young Professionals, THRIVE (employees with mental, emotional, and physical disabilities and their allies), and Women in Networking—with over 12,000 members worldwide. Our ERGs welcome any employee interested in supporting their mission and participation is optional. \nEmployee Engagement\nOur annual employee engagement survey explores how employees feel about their experience at our company and enables us to develop tailored actions to enhance the working environment. Focused on measuring engagement, inclusion, well-being, and leadership effectiveness, this fully digital, enterprise-wide survey is available to all employees in 22 languages. In fiscal 2025, we had a participation rate of 88% and year over year improvement in all four indices of engagement, inclusion, well-being, and leadership effectiveness. Our engagement and inclusion \nscores were once again favorable when compared to external global manufacturing benchmark\ns. \nTraining and Development\nWe provide employees with a range of development programs, opportunities, skills, and resources, empowering them to unleash their potential. Also, we emphasize employee development and training to support engagement and retention. Our LEARN@TE platform supplements our talent development strategies. It is an online portal that enables employees to access instructor-led classroom or virtual courses and self-directed web-based courses. Strategy, execution, and talent (“SET”) leadership expectations, which focus on how we drive strategy, effectively execute, and build talent, are expectations of all employees and are embedded in all of our leadership programs. We integrate these behavioral expectations into the way we assess and select talent, manage performance, and develop and reward our people. \nWe are committed to identifying and developing our next generation of leaders. We have a robust talent and succession planning process, and we offer programs to support the development of leaders at all levels and those in critical roles, general management, engineering, and operations. We are focused on recruiting top candidates, developing employees at all levels, and providing opportunities for career advancement. On an annual basis, we conduct an organization and leadership review process with our Chief Executive Officer and all segment, business unit, and function leaders focusing on our high-performing and high-potential talent, globally diverse talent, and the succession for our most critical roles. Also, our \n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nboard of directors reviews and assesses management development plans for senior executives and the succession plans relating to those positions.\nWe believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our Chief Executive Officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry. For discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see “Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nHealth, Safety, and Well-being\nWe are committed to the health, safety, well-being, and human rights of our employees, ensuring that all of our people can thrive both at work and beyond. Our approach goes beyond compliance. We strive to create an environment where everyone feels safe, respected, and supported, while providing the tools and resources needed to balance work and personal lives and take ownership of their well-being. Our environmental, health, and safety teams continuously seek ways to raise the standards of safety, health, well-being, and human rights across our organization. Our “Mission Zero” strategy engages all employees to review our safety policies, complete training, and sign a personal commitment to uphold a safe work environment. We aspire to be an injury-free workplace and, as such, we have compliance audits and internal processes in place to stay ahead of workplace hazards. In fiscal 2025, we reduced our Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) total recordable incident rate—a rate equivalent to the number of incidents per 100 employees or 200,000 work hours—to 0.06, with no employee or contractor fatalities. \nWe remain focused on the protection of global human rights and have instituted several policies to guide us including our global human rights policy and our human trafficking and modern slavery policy. Our Human Rights Committee of cross-functional leaders, which was established in fiscal 2024, assesses and mitigates the areas of greatest risk for our operations and value chain, and we have developed a roadmap to strengthen our human rights approach. We apply high standards of human rights and require that our suppliers do the same.\nGovernment Regulation and Supervision\nThe import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.\nEnvironmental\nOur operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, hazardous materials in products, and chemical usage. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards; staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues; periodic compliance auditing; training; and other measures. We also have a program for compliance with the European Union (“EU”) Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directives; the China Administrative Measures for the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products (“China RoHS”) regulation; the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulation; and similar laws.\nCompliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. For example, laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating GHG emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, available information, and applicable laws, as of fiscal year end 2025, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $18 million to $44 million, and we accrued $23 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2026 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to GHG emissions.\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSustainability\nWe look to build on our strong foundation of environmental sustainability in our operations. Our One Connected World strategy guides how we balance investor and customer expectations and drive improved environmental sustainability. We support a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future through the products that come out of our facilities. \nOur sustainability initiatives began several years ago and have continued to evolve. From fiscal 2020 to 2025, we achieved more than a 25% reduction in energy use intensity, more than a 25% reduction in total water withdrawal, and more than an 80% reduction in absolute GHG emissions for Scopes 1 and 2.\nWe have challenged ourselves to find new ways to continue to drive sustainability improvements. We have also committed to near-term, company-wide GHG emissions reductions in line with climate science and Science Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”) objectives. These reduction goals were validated by the SBTi and we are currently listed on its “Companies Taking Action” target dashboard which shows companies and financial institutions that have set science-based targets, or have committed to developing such targets. \nOur mid-term goals and long-term ambitions, many of which have already been achieved, include the following:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nTargeted Fiscal Year\n​\n​\n    \n​\n    \nBaseline Fiscal Year\n    \n of Achievement\n    \nAchieved\n​\n70%+ reduction in absolute GHG emissions for Scopes 1 and 2\n​\n2020\n​\n2030\n​\nX\n​\n30% reduction in absolute GHG emissions for Scope 3\n​\n2022\n​\n2032\n​\n​\n​\n15% reduction in water withdrawals at target sites with extremely high and high water stress\n​\n2021\n​\n2025\n​\nX\n​\n15% reduction in hazardous waste disposed\n​\n2021\n​\n2025\n​\nX\n​\n80% renewable electricity use in our operations\n​\nn/a\n​\n2025\n​\nX\n​\nWe continue to assess our goals and ambitions and periodically update our environmental commitments.\nWhile sustainability is embedded in our operations, we are exploring opportunities with our direct suppliers and logistics service providers to strengthen the environmental sustainability of our supply chain. In addition to improving the sustainability of our operations and working with our suppliers to reduce their GHG emissions, we help our customers produce smaller, lighter, and more energy-efficient products, reducing the environmental impact of the products throughout their lives.\nAdditional information regarding our sustainability initiatives and progress is available in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report located on our website at \nwww.te.com\n under the heading “About TE—Corporate Responsibility.” The contents of our Corporate Responsibility Report are not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAvailable Information\nAll periodic and current reports, registration filings, and other filings that we are required to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) are available free of charge through our internet website at \nwww.te.com\n.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Information.”\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).\nDiscussion of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 is presented below. The “Segment Results” section also discusses fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 because of the change in our segment structure discussed below. Discussion of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 can be found in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2024.\nThe following discussion includes organic net sales growth (decline) which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” for additional information regarding this measure.\n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nWe are a global industrial technology leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. As a trusted innovation partner, our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions enable the distribution of power, signal, and data to advance next-generation transportation, energy networks, automated factories, data centers enabling artificial intelligence, and more.\nChange in Place of Incorporation\nDuring fiscal 2024, our board of directors and shareholders approved a change in our jurisdiction of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. In connection with the change, TE Connectivity Ltd., our former parent entity, entered into a merger agreement with TE Connectivity plc, its then wholly-owned subsidiary and a public limited company incorporated under Irish law. Under the merger agreement, TE Connectivity Ltd. merged with and into TE Connectivity plc, which was the surviving entity, in order to effect our change in jurisdiction of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. The merger was completed on September 30, 2024, thereby changing our jurisdiction of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. Effective for fiscal 2025, we are organized under the laws of Ireland. We have not had and do not anticipate any material changes in our operations or financial results as a result of the merger and change in place of incorporation.\nNew Segment Structure\nEffective for fiscal 2025, we reorganized our management and segments to align the organization around our current strategy. We now operate through two reportable segments: Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions. Prior period segment results have been recast to conform to the new segment structure. See additional information regarding our segments in Notes 1 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSummary of Fiscal 2025 Performance\n●\nOur fiscal 2025 net sales increased 8.9% from fiscal 2024 due to sales growth in the Industrial Solutions segment, partially offset by sales declines in the Transportation Solutions segment. Richards Manufacturing, which was acquired in April 2025, contributed net sales of $179 million. On an organic basis, our net sales increased 6.4% in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. \n●\nOur net sales by segment were as follows:\n●\nTransportation Solutions\n—Our net sales decreased 1.0% in fiscal 2025 due primarily to sales declines in the sensors and commercial transportation end markets.\n●\nIndustrial Solutions\n—Our net sales increased 23.7% in fiscal 2025 as a result of sales growth in the digital data networks; energy; automation and connected living; and aerospace, defense, and marine end markets, partially offset by sales declines in the medical end market.\n●\nWe paid cash dividends to shareholders of $2.72 per ordinary share in fiscal 2025. Also, in September 2025, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.71 per ordinary share, payable on December 12, 2025, to shareholders of record on November 21, 2025.\n●\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4,139 million in fiscal 2025.\nEconomic Conditions\nOur business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. The global economy has been impacted in recent years by supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost pressures, and, most recently, tariff and trade policies. We are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve.\nIn recent years, we have experienced inflationary cost pressures including increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials. However, we have been able to mitigate increased costs and supply chain disruptions through productivity and/or price increases. Also, we have taken and continue to focus on actions to manage costs, including restructuring and \n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\nother cost reduction initiatives such as reducing discretionary spending and travel. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. See further discussion in “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nWe are actively monitoring developments in tariff and trade policies and the potential impacts on our business. In addition, we are using pricing actions and sourcing changes to largely mitigate the impacts of new tariffs and changes in existing tariff rates.\nWe continue to monitor military conflicts in certain parts of the world as well as escalating tensions in surrounding countries and associated sanctions. These did not have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations during fiscal 2025 and 2024.\nOutlook\n In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we expect our net sales to be approximately $4.5 billion as compared to $3.8 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. This increase reflects sales growth in both the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. The Industrial Solutions segment will benefit from the acquisition of Richards Manufacturing. We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately $2.33 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. This outlook reflects the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $113 million and $0.02 per share, respectively,\n \nin the first quarter of fiscal 2026 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2025 and includes the impact of currently enacted tariffs. Also, this outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.\nAcquisitions\nAs discussed above, on April 1, 2025, we acquired 100% of Richards Manufacturing, a U.S.-based producer of overhead and underground electrical and gas distribution products, for cash of approximately $2.3 billion, net of cash acquired. The acquired business has been reported as part of the energy business within our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we acquired two additional businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $321 million, net of cash acquired. The acquired businesses have been reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. \nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired approximately 98.7% of the outstanding shares of Schaffner Holding AG (“Schaffner”), a leader in electromagnetic solutions based in Switzerland, for CHF 505.00 per share in cash for a purchase price of CHF 294 million (equivalent to $339 million), net of cash acquired. The acquired business has been reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed a squeeze-out of the remaining minority shareholders for $5 million and the Schaffner shares were delisted from the SIX Swiss Exchange. \nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.\nDivestitures\nDuring fiscal 2024, we sold one business for net cash proceeds of $59 million. In connection with the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $10 million. Prior to divestiture, the business was reported in our Transportation Solutions segment. \nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding divestitures.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nNet Sales\nThe following table presents our net sales and the percentage of total net sales by segment:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFiscal\n​\n​\n    \n2025\n    \n    \n2024\n    \n    \n​\n \n($ in millions)\n​\nTransportation Solutions\n​\n$\n 9,388\n     \n 54\n%  \n​\n$\n 9,481\n     \n 60\n%\n​\nIndustrial Solutions\n​\n \n 7,874\n \n 46\n​\n​\n \n 6,364\n \n 40\n​\n​\nTotal\n​\n$\n 17,262\n \n 100\n%  \n​\n$\n 15,845\n \n 100\n%\n​\nThe following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales by segment:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nChange in Net Sales for Fiscal 2025 versus Fiscal 2024\n​\n​\n​\nNet Sales\n​\nOrganic Net Sales\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAcquisitions\n​\n​\n    \nGrowth (Decline)\n​\nGrowth (Decline)\n​\nTranslation\n    \n(Divestiture)\n    \n​\n​\n($ in millions)\n​\nTransportation Solutions\n​\n$\n (93)\n    \n (1.0)\n%  \n$\n (98)\n    \n (1.0)\n%  \n$\n 17\n​\n$\n (12)\n​\nIndustrial Solutions\n​\n \n 1,510\n \n 23.7\n​\n \n 1,116\n \n 17.6\n​\n \n 34\n​\n \n 360\n​\nTotal\n​\n$\n 1,417\n \n 8.9\n%  \n$\n 1,018\n \n 6.4\n%  \n$\n 51\n​\n$\n 348\n​\nNet sales increased $1,417 million, or 8.9%, in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales resulted primarily from organic net sales growth of 6.4% and the net positive impact of 2.2% from acquisitions and a divestiture. Richards Manufacturing, which was acquired on April 1, 2025, contributed net sales of $179 million in fiscal 2025. In fiscal 2025, net pricing actions positively affected organic net sales by $51 million. See further discussion of net sales below under “Segment Results.”\nNet Sales by Geographic Region.\n \nOur business operates in three geographic regions—Asia–Pacific, EMEA, and the Americas—and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. We sell our products into approximately 130 countries, and approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2025.

These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.\nDuring fiscal 2025 and 2024, we initiated restructuring programs associated with footprint consolidation and cost structure improvements in both of our segments. We incurred net restructuring charges of $113 million and $144 million in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2025 are expected to be approximately $80 million and are expected to be fully realized by the end of fiscal 2026. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2026, we expect total restructuring charges to be approximately $100 million and total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $100 million.\nDuring fiscal 2024, we recorded a gain on divestiture of $10 million.\nDuring fiscal 2025 and 2024, we incurred costs of $11 million and $20 million, respectively, related to our change in place of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland.

The global minimum tax is a significant structural change to the international taxation framework and more than 50 countries have thus far enacted some or all elements of the tax. Ireland has implemented elements of the OECD’s global minimum tax rules, which were effective for us beginning in fiscal 2025. In January 2025, the OECD released new guidance for the global minimum tax rules which impacted the realizability of certain deferred tax assets associated with a ten-year tax credit obtained by a Swiss subsidiary in fiscal 2024. We anticipate further legislative activity and administrative guidance. We continue to closely monitor the evolving global minimum tax framework and assess the implications in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $8,821 million and $8,285 million at fiscal year end 2025 and 2024, respectively. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.\nAs of fiscal year end 2025, certain subsidiaries had approximately $37.7 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities.

Richards Manufacturing contributed net sales of $179 million in fiscal 2025.

Our organic net sales by industry end market were as follows:\n●\nDigital data networks\n—Our organic net sales increased 10.2% in fiscal 2024 \ndue to growth in AI applications, partially offset by reduced demand resulting from inventory corrections in the supply chain in the first half of the year\n.\n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\nAutomation and connected living\n—Our organic net sales decreased 19.1% in fiscal 2024 due to declines in factory automation applications and the appliances market.\n●\nAerospace, defense, and marine\n—Our organic net sales increased 15.4% in fiscal 2024 \ndue to growth in all markets\n.\n●\nEnergy\n—Our organic net sales increased 4.9% in fiscal 2024 \ndue to growth in the Americas and EMEA regions, partially offset by declines in the Asia–Pacific region\n.\n●\nMedical\n—Our organic net sales increased 6.5% in fiscal 2024 \nprimarily as a result of growth in interventional medical applications\n.\nOperating Income. \nThe following table presents the Industrial Solutions segment’s operating income and operating margin information:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nFiscal\n​\nFiscal\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2025\n​\n2024\n​\n​\n​\nFiscal\n​\n​\nversus\n​\nversus\n​\n​\n    \n2025\n    \n    \n2024\n    \n    \n2023\n    \n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n​\n​\n($ in millions)\n​\nOperating income\n​\n$\n 1,393\n​\n​\n$\n 916\n​\n​\n$\n 817\n​\n​\n$\n 477\n​\n$\n 99\n​\nOperating margin\n​\n \n 17.7\n%  \n​\n \n 14.4\n%  \n​\n \n 12.8\n%  \n​\n \n​\n​\n \n​\n​\nOperating income in the Industrial Solutions segment increased $477 million in fiscal 2025 from fiscal 2024.

We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the repayment of $500 million of 4.50% senior notes and $350 million of 3.70% senior notes, both due in February 2026. Also, we may use funds to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, reduce our outstanding debt, or return cash to shareholders through dividends on our ordinary shares or purchases of our ordinary shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions. We believe that we have sufficient financial resources and liquidity which will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital and other cash flow needs. \nAs of fiscal year end 2025, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws, substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity plc, our Irish parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense. We provide for tax liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to amounts that we expect to \n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\nrepatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations. As of fiscal year end 2025, we had approximately $3.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA and TE Connectivity plc but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that an immaterial amount of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $662 million to $4,139 million in fiscal 2025 as compared to $3,477 million in fiscal 2024. The increase resulted primarily from higher pre-tax income and a reduction in income tax payments. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2025 and 2024 was $276 million and $475 million, respectively.\nPension contributions were $69 million in both fiscal 2025 and 2024. We expect pension contributions to be approximately $70 million in fiscal 2026, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. For additional information regarding pensions, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCapital expenditures were $936 million and $680 million in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. We expect fiscal 2026 capital spending levels to be approximately 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we acquired Richards Manufacturing for approximately $2.3 billion, net of cash acquired. Also during fiscal 2025, we acquired two additional businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $321 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired one business for a cash purchase price of $339 million, net of cash acquired, during fiscal 2024. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions.\nDuring fiscal 2024, we received net cash proceeds of $59 million related to the sale of one business. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding divestitures.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization\nTotal debt at fiscal year end 2025 and 2024 was $5,694 million and $4,203 million, respectively. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.\nDuring fiscal 2025, TEGSA, our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued €500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% senior notes due in May 2028, $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due in February 2031, €750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior notes due in January 2033, and $450 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due in May 2035. The notes issued during fiscal 2025 are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.\nTEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a maturity date of April 2029 and aggregate commitments of $1.5 billion. The Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $500 million and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2025 or 2024.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) with respect to revolving loans denominated in U.S. dollars, (a) the term secured overnight financing rate (“Term SOFR”) (as defined in the Credit Facility) or (b) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Bank of America, N.A.’s base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus \n1\n/\n2\n of 1%, (iii) the Term SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 1%, and (iv) 1%, and (2) with respect to revolving loans determined in an alternative currency, (a) an alternative currency daily rate or (b) an alternative currency term rate, as applicable, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, \n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\nlong-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee. Based on the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA, this fee ranges from 5.0 to 12.5 basis points of the lenders’ commitments under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 (or temporarily 4.25 following a qualified acquisition) to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of fiscal year end 2025, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.\nPeriodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. At fiscal year end 2025, TEGSA had no commercial paper outstanding. TEGSA had $255 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.95% at fiscal year end 2024.\nPayment obligations under TEGSA’s senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by TEGSA’s parent, TE Connectivity Switzerland Ltd., and its parent, TE Connectivity plc.\nPayments of ordinary/common share dividends to shareholders were $803 million and $760 million in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding dividends.\nIn September 2025, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.71 per ordinary share, payable on December 12, 2025, to shareholders of record on November 21, 2025.\nFollowing our change in place of incorporation, dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, may be declared on a quarterly basis by our board of directors, as provided by Irish law. Shareholder approval is no longer required for interim dividends. In exercising its discretion to approve such dividends, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future business prospects, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by Irish law, and other factors that they may deem relevant.\nDuring fiscal 2025, our board of directors authorized an increase of $2.5 billion in our share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately 8 million of our ordinary shares for $1,356 million and approximately 14 million of our common shares for $1,991 million under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. At fiscal year end 2025, we had $1.4 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.\nSummarized \nGuarantor Financial Information\nAs discussed above, our senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are issued by TEGSA and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by TEGSA’s parent, TE Connectivity Switzerland Ltd., and its parent, TE Connectivity plc. In addition to being the issuer of our debt securities, TEGSA owns, directly or indirectly, all of our operating subsidiaries.

The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2026 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nIn disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAt fiscal year end 2025, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $219 million.\n​\n​\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other material obligations at fiscal year end 2025:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPayments Due\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nIn Fiscal 2026\n    \nThereafter\n    \nTotal\n    \n​\n​\n(in millions)\n \nLong-term debt:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPrincipal payments\n(1)\n​\n$\n 852\n​\n$\n 4,901\n​\n$\n 5,753\n​\nInterest payments on debt\n(2)\n​\n \n 182\n​\n \n 1,068\n​\n \n 1,250\n​\nOperating leases\n(3)\n​\n \n 126\n​\n \n 422\n​\n \n 548\n​\nPurchase obligations\n(4)\n​\n \n 973\n​\n \n 73\n​\n \n 1,046\n​\nTotal contractual cash obligations\n(5)(6)(7)\n​\n$\n 2,133\n​\n$\n 6,464\n​\n$\n 8,597\n​\n(1)\nSee Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.\n37\n\n\nTable of Contents\n(2)\nInterest payments exclude the impact of any interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding leases.\n(4)\nPurchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services.\n(5)\nThe above table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of $719 million and related accrued interest and penalties of $89 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits, interest, and penalties.\n(6)\nThe above table does not reflect pension obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute approximately $70 million to pension plans in fiscal 2026, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments.\n(7)\nThe \nabove table does not reflect redeemable noncontrolling interests of $145 million associated with our First Sensor AG (“First Sensor”) subsidiary. Noncontrolling interest holders can elect either (1) to remain First Sensor noncontrolling interest shareholders and receive recurring annual compensation of €0.56 per First Sensor share or (2) to put their First Sensor shares in exchange for compensation of €33.27 per First Sensor share. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments is uncertain. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding redeemable noncontrolling interests\n.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, trade compliance matters, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management’s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control. We transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers, the customers accept and have legal title for the product, and we have a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. Our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the \n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\noptional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations.\nOur standard terms of sale generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. In certain instances, we may sell products to customers under terms other than our standard terms. We do not account for warranties as separate performance obligations.\nAlthough products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, \nIntangibles—Goodwill and Other\n.\nIntangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include customer relationships and intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology. Recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant.\nWe test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (a “component”) if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2025, we had four reporting units, all of which contained goodwill. There were two reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure.\nGoodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. In assessing a potential impairment, management relies on several reporting unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis.\nWhen testing for goodwill impairment, we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the amount of the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nFair value estimates used in the goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach is supported by a guideline analysis (a market approach). These approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and determined that no impairment existed.\nIncome Taxes\nIn determining pre-tax income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of \n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncertain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of pre-tax operating income in various tax jurisdictions, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\nWe currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.\nChanges in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any enacted changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, \nIncome Taxes\n, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPension Plans\nOur defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustees of the funds. The benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.\nNet periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants, or, for inactive plans, over the remaining life expectancy of participants.\nTwo critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are discount rates and expected long-term returns on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. Discount rates represent the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and are used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in discount rates increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2025, a 25-basis-point decrease in discount rates would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $63 million; a 25-basis-point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by $60 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rates of return on \n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\nplan assets. A 50-basis-point decrease or increase in the expected long-term returns on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2025 pension expense by $9 million.\nAt fiscal year end 2025, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans’ master trust is 25% return-seeking assets and 75% liability-hedging assets. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 110%. Based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2025, our target asset allocation is 67% return-seeking and 33% liability-hedging.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nOrganic Net Sales Growth (Decline)\nWe present organic net sales growth (decline) as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth (decline) represents net sales growth (decline) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth (decline) is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management’s control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.\nOrganic net sales growth (decline) provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses this measure together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in “Results of Operations” and “Segment Results” provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth (decline) to net sales growth (decline) calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nOrganic net sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth (decline) in combination with net sales growth (decline) to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.\nForward-Looking Information\nCertain statements in this Annual Report are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.
