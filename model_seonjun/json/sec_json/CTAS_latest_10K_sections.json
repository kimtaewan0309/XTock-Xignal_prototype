Farmer when he left his family's industrial laundry business in order to develop uniform programs using an exclusive new fabric. In the early 1970's, Cintas acquired the family industrial laundry business. Over the years, Cintas developed additional products and services that complemented its core uniform business and broadened the scope of products and services available to its customers.\nBusiness Segments\nCintas’ reportable operating segments are the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services, as well as workplace water services. The remainder of Cintas’ business, which consists of the Fire Protection Services operating segment and the Uniform Direct Sale operating segment, is included in All Other. \nThe following table sets forth Cintas' total revenue and the revenue derived from each reportable operating segment and the remaining operating segments included in All Other for the fiscal years ended May 31:\n(In thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nUniform Rental and Facility Services\n$\n7,976,073 \n$\n7,465,199 \n$\n6,897,130 \nFirst Aid and Safety Services\n1,218,090 \n1,067,334 \n951,496 \nAll Other\n1,146,018 \n1,064,082 \n967,143 \nTotal Revenue \n$\n10,340,181 \n$\n9,596,615 \n$\n8,815,769 \nAdditional information regarding each reportable operating segment and All Other is also included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" in \nNote 14\n entitled Operating Segment Information of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nCustomers\nWe provide our products and services to over one million businesses of all types, from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people. This diversity in customer base results in no individual customer accounting for greater than one percent of Cintas' total revenue. As a result, the loss of one account would not have a material financial impact on Cintas.\nCompetition\nThe primary markets served by each of the Cintas operating segments are local in nature and highly fragmented. Cintas competes with national, regional and local providers, large national retailers and small local retailers as well as companies with a significant online presence and the level of competition varies at each of Cintas' local operations. In addition, businesses may decide to perform certain services in-house instead of outsourcing these services. Product, design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in each of our operating segments.\n3\nOperations and Distribution\nWithin the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, Cintas provides its products and services to customers via local delivery routes originating from rental processing plants and branches. Within the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, Cintas provides its products and services via its distribution network and local delivery routes or local representatives. At May 31, 2025, Cintas, in total, had approximately 12,100 local delivery routes, 478 operational facilities and 12 distribution centers. \nSourcing\nCintas is committed to sourcing responsibly. Cintas sources finished products from many outside suppliers. As mentioned on our website, www.cintas.com, each and every supplier must comply with a vendor code of conduct as a condition of doing business with Cintas. Cintas also conducts internal training to ensure that employee-partners who have direct responsibility for supply chain management are knowledgeable and aware of issues and concerns surrounding our supply chain. In addition to sourcing from third-party suppliers, Cintas operates five manufacturing facilities that provide for standard uniform needs. Cintas purchases fabric, used in the manufacturing of its products, from several suppliers. Cintas' ability to find qualified suppliers who meet its standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is subject to ongoing market risks. For a discussion of the risks associated with sourcing that may materially impact Cintas, please see \"",

This strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include market segments to which we have not historically served. We will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers.\nTo pursue the strategy of increasing penetration, we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis. This frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships. The combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services.\nWe pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in several ways. Cintas has a national sales organization introducing all its products and services to prospects in all market segments. Our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. We also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion. Finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.\nResults of Operations\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section focuses on discussion of fiscal 2025 results compared to fiscal 2024 results and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under \"\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n.\" For discussion of fiscal 2024 results compared to fiscal 2023 results, see the \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on July 25, 2024.\nCintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an All Other category. Cintas’ two reportable operating segments are Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services, as well as workplace water services. The remainder of Cintas’ business, which consists of the Fire Protection Services operating segment and the Uniform Direct Sale operating segment, is included in All Other. These operating segments consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and operating income. Revenue and operating income for the reportable operating segments for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 are presented in \nNote 14\n entitled Operating Segment Information of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\" The Company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker (CODM) regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate.\n19\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percent of revenue by reportable operating segment, All Other and in total for the fiscal years ended May 31:\n2025\n2024\nRevenue:\n \n \nUniform Rental and Facility Services\n77.1%\n77.8%\nFirst Aid and Safety Services\n11.8%\n11.1%\nAll Other\n11.1%\n11.1%\nTotal revenue\n100.0%\n100.0%\nCost of sales:\n \n \nUniform Rental and Facility Services\n50.7%\n51.8%\nFirst Aid and Safety Services\n42.8%\n44.5%\nAll Other\n52.7%\n53.6%\nTotal cost of sales\n50.0%\n51.2%\nGross margin:\n \n \nUniform Rental and Facility Services\n49.3%\n48.2%\nFirst Aid and Safety Services\n57.2%\n55.5%\nAll Other\n47.3%\n46.4%\nTotal gross margin\n50.0%\n48.8%\nSelling and administrative expenses:\nUniform Rental and Facility Services\n25.8%\n26.0%\nFirst Aid and Safety Services\n33.0%\n33.1%\nAll Other\n30.6%\n30.4%\nTotal selling and administrative expenses\n27.2%\n27.3%\nOperating income:\nUniform Rental and Facility Services\n23.5%\n22.2%\nFirst Aid and Safety Services\n24.2%\n22.4%\nAll Other\n16.7%\n16.0%\nTotal operating income\n22.8%\n21.6%\nInterest expense, net\n0.9%\n1.0%\nIncome before income taxes\n21.9%\n20.5%\nFiscal 2025 Compared to Fiscal 2024 \nFiscal 2025 total revenue was $10.3 billion, an increase of 7.7% over the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased organically by 8.0% primarily as a result of increased sales volume. Organic revenue growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Total revenue was positively impacted by 0.8% due to acquisitions, negatively impacted by 0.9% due to two less workdays in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 and negatively impacted by 0.2% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n20\nOrganic revenue growth by quarter for fiscal 2025 is as follows: \nFirst quarter ended August 31, 2024\n8.0%\nSecond quarter ended November 30, 2024\n7.1%\nThird quarter ended February 28, 2025\n7.9%\nFourth quarter ended May 31, 2025\n9.0%\nFor the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025\n8.0%\nUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased 6.8%, to $7,976.1 million compared to $7,465.2 million in fiscal 2024. Organic revenue growth for this reportable operating segment was 7.0%. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.8% due to acquisitions, negatively impacted by 0.9% due to two less workdays in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 and negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Revenue growth was a result of new business, the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and price increases, partially offset by lost business. New business growth resulted from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. Generally, sales productivity improvements are due to increased tenure and improved training, which produce a higher number of products and services sold. \nOther revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 10.9%, to $2,364.1 million compared to $2,131.4 million in fiscal 2024. Revenue improved from increases in sales representative productivity and price increases. Revenue increased organically by 11.3%. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.6% due to acquisitions, negatively impacted by 0.9% due to two less workdays in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 and negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nCost of uniform rental and facility services increased 4.5% compared to fiscal 2024. Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in-service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. The change from the prior year was primarily due to higher Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment sales volume, as well as an increase in material cost to support increased revenue growth. The cost of uniform rental and facility services as a percent of revenue improved compared to fiscal 2024 from 51.8% to 50.7% primarily due to efficiency gains in energy usage, more efficient use of in-service inventory and production efficiency gains.\nCost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, personal protective equipment, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased 7.7% in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, as a result of higher other revenue, but decreased as a percent of revenue to 47.6%, compared to 49.0% in fiscal 2024. The improvement in cost of sales as a percent to revenue was primarily due to favorable changes in the sales mix and sourcing and productivity initiatives in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment.\nSelling and administrative expenses increased $196.7 million, to 27.2% as a percent of revenue, compared to 27.3% in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025 we recorded a $15 million gain on a sale of property, and in fiscal 2024 we recorded $15 million associated with a legal settlement, both of which impacted all segments by the same percent of revenue. Excluding those items, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025. The resulting increase as a percent of revenue was primarily due to investments in technology and additional selling resources.\nNet interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $95.5 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $95.0 million in fiscal 2024. Net interest expense was the same as a percent of revenue.\nIncome before income taxes was $2,264.2 million, an increase of $290.6 million, or 14.7%, compared to fiscal 2024. The increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to revenue growth, as well as the improvements in gross margin previously mentioned.\n21\nCintas' effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 was 20.0% and 20.4%, respectively. The effective tax rate in both periods was impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. \nNet income for fiscal 2025 of $1,812.3 million was a 15.3% increase compared to fiscal 2024. Diluted earnings per share of $4.40 was a 16.1% increase compared to fiscal 2024 diluted earnings per share of $3.79. Diluted earnings per share increased primarily due to the increase in net income.\nUniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating Segment\nUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $510.9 million, or 6.8%, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $175.8 million, or 4.5%, due to the reasons previously discussed. The reportable operating segment's fiscal 2025 gross margin was 49.3% of revenue compared to 48.2% in fiscal 2024. The improvement in gross margin was primarily due to efficiency gains in energy usage, more efficient use of in-service inventory and production efficiency gains.\nSelling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased $121.2 million in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 in order to support revenue growth as well as invest in technology and selling resources. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2025 was 25.8% compared to 26.0% in fiscal 2024. Excluding the items noted previously, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were largely consistent as compared to the prior fiscal year. \nIncome before income taxes for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased $213.9 million, or 12.9%, for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. The increase in income before income taxes was due to the previously discussed growth in revenue and improvements in gross margin. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue was 23.5% compared to 22.2% in fiscal 2024. The improvement over the prior fiscal year was primarily a result of the previously discussed improvement in gross margin. \nFirst Aid and Safety Services Reportable Operating Segment\nFirst Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $150.8 million in fiscal 2025, a 14.1% increase compared to fiscal 2024. Organic revenue growth for this reportable operating segment was 15.0%. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.1% due to acquisitions, negatively impacted by 0.9% due to two less workdays in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 and negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The increase in revenue was driven by many factors including increases in new business sold by sales representatives, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers, price increases and strong customer retention. \nCost of sales for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased $46.8 million, or 9.9%, in fiscal 2025, due to higher sales volume. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses and service expenses. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 57.2% for fiscal 2025 compared to 55.5% in fiscal 2024. The improvement in gross margin as a percent of revenue was primarily driven by favorable changes in the sales mix, sourcing and productivity initiatives, as well as i\nmproved leverage of fixed costs and a reduction in energy expense as a percent of revenue.\n \nSelling and administrative expenses for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased by $48.4 million, or 13.7%, in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, but decreased as a percent of revenue to 33.0% in fiscal 2025 compared to 33.1% in fiscal 2024. Excluding the items noted previously, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were largely consistent as compared to the prior fiscal year.  \nIncome before income taxes for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment was $294.7 million in fiscal 2025, an increase of $55.6 million, or 23.2%, compared to fiscal 2024. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 24.2%, increased from 22.4% in fiscal 2024 due to the previously discussed growth in revenue and improvements in gross margin.\n22\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents as of and for the fiscal years ended May 31:\n(In thousands)\n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,165,905 \n$\n2,068,500 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(623,638)\n$\n(603,334)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(1,619,011)\n$\n(1,247,506)\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year\n$\n263,973 \n$\n342,015 \nCash and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2025 and 2024, include $57.8 million and $42.1 million, respectively, that is located outside of the U.S. \nCash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of long-term debt. \nWe expect our cash flows from operating activities to remain sufficient to provide us with adequate levels of liquidity. In addition, we have access to $2.0 billion of debt capacity from our amended and restated revolving credit facility. We believe the Company has sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividends remain strategic objectives, but they will be dependent on the economic outlook and liquidity of the Company.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2,165.9 million for fiscal 2025, which was an increase of $97.4 million, or 4.7%, compared to fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in net income and favorable changes in working capital, primarily accounts payable and accrued compensation and related liabilities. These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital, specifically inventories, net, accounts receivable, net and uniforms and other rental items in service.  \nNet cash used in investing activities was $623.6 million in fiscal 2025, compared to $603.3 million in fiscal 2024. Net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures, purchases of investments and cash paid for acquisitions of businesses. These outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property. Capital expenditures were $408.9 million and $409.5 million for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 included $301.6 million for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment and $55.4 million for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. Cash paid for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, was $232.9 million and $186.8 million for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. The acquisitions in both fiscal 2025 and 2024 occurred in our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection operating segment, which is included in All Other. In addition, during fiscal 2025, Cintas received cash proceeds of $24.0 million related to the sale of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities also included $7.2 million and $7.5 million of purchases of investments during fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. \nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,619.0 million for fiscal 2025, compared to $1,247.5 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in cash used in financing activities was due to the increase in repayment of debt, share buyback activity and an increase in dividends paid. These increases were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of debt in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. \nCintas announced on July 27, 2021, that the Board authorized a $1.5 billion share buyback program, which was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. On July 26, 2022 and July 23, 2024, Cintas announced that the Board authorized new share buyback programs, each for $1.0 billion. Neither of the outstanding share buyback programs have an expiration date. \n23\nThe following table summarizes the share buyback activity by program and fiscal years ended May 31:\n2025\n2024\nBuyback Program\n(In thousands except per share data)\nShares\nAverage Price\nper Share\nPurchase\nPrice\nShares\nAverage Price\nper Share\nPurchase\nPrice\nJuly 27, 2021\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n3,425 \n$\n133.80 \n$\n458,284 \nJuly 26, 2022\n3,794 \n179.07 \n679,329 \n339 \n168.44 \n57,104 \nJuly 23, 2024\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n3,794 \n$\n179.07 \n$\n679,329 \n3,764 \n$\n136.92 \n$\n515,388 \nShares acquired for taxes due \n(1)\n1,297 \n$\n196.87 \n$\n255,471 \n1,325 \n$\n139.34 \n$\n184,645 \nTotal repurchase of Cintas common stock\n$\n934,800 \n$\n700,033 \n(1)\n   Shares of Cintas stock acquired for employee-partner payroll taxes due on options exercised and vested restricted stock awards.\nThere were no share buybacks in the period subsequent to May 31, 2025, through July 28, 2025.

On May 1, 2025, in accordance with the terms of the senior notes, Cintas paid the $400.0 million aggregate principal outstanding of its 3.45%, 3-year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand. On May 2, 2025, Cintas issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that bear an interest rate of 4.20% and mature on May 1, 2028. \nDuring the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, Cintas repurchased and subsequently retired, $13.5 million of its 6.15%, 30-year senior notes. In conjunction with these transactions, Cintas recognized a loss of $0.9 million, which is recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. The following table summarizes Cintas' outstanding debt at May 31:\n(In thousands)\nInterest\n Rate\nFiscal Year\nIssued\nFiscal Year\nMaturity\n2025\n2024\nDebt due within one year\nSenior notes \n(1)\n3.11%\n2015\n2025\n$\n— \n$\n50,294 \nSenior notes\n3.45%\n2022\n2025\n— \n400,000 \nDebt issuance costs\n— \n(699)\nTotal debt due within one year\n$\n— \n$\n449,595 \nDebt due after one year\nSenior notes\n3.70%\n2017\n2027\n$\n1,000,000 \n$\n1,000,000 \nSenior notes\n4.20%\n2025\n2028\n400,000 \n— \nSenior notes\n4.00%\n2022\n2032\n800,000 \n800,000 \nSenior notes\n6.15%\n2007\n2037\n236,550 \n236,550 \nDebt issuance costs\n(11,551)\n(10,616)\n   Total debt due after one year\n$\n2,424,999 \n$\n2,025,934 \n(1)\n     Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K Services, Inc. (G&K) in fiscal 2017, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate until repayment in fiscal 2025.\nThe credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program has capacity under the revolving credit facility of $2.0 billion. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility of up to $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is March 23, 2027. As of both May 31, 2025 and 2024, there was no commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. \nCintas' debt agreements contain certain covenants. These covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens and priority debt, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented. \nOur access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future based on our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. Additionally, our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rates and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of May 31, 2025, our ratings were as follows:\nRating Agency\nOutlook\nCommercial\nPaper\nLong-term\nDebt\nStandard & Poor’s\nStable\nA-2\nA-\nMoody’s Investors Service\nStable\nP-2\nA3\n25\nIn the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.\n \nTo monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, long-term debt and standby letters of credit.  \nFinancial and Nonfinancial Disclosure About Issuers and Guarantors of Cintas’ Senior Notes\nCintas Corporation No. 2 (Corp. 2) is the indirectly, wholly owned principal operating subsidiary of Cintas. Corp. 2 is the issuer of the $2,436.6 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding as of May 31, 2025, which are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Cintas Corporation and its wholly owned, direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries. See \nNote 6\n entitled Debt, Derivatives and Hedging Activities of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for more information on Cintas' outstanding debt.\nBasis of Preparation of the Summarized Financial Information\nThe following tables include summarized financial information of Cintas Corporation, Corp. 2 (issuer) and subsidiary guarantors (together, the Obligor Group). Investments in and equity in the earnings of non-guarantors, which are not members of the Obligor Group, have been excluded. Non-guarantor subsidiaries are located outside the U.S., and therefore, excluded from the Obligor Group.\nThe summarized financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances and transactions between entities in the Obligor Group eliminated. The Obligor Group’s amounts due from, amounts due to and transactions with non-guarantors have been presented in separate line items, if they are material. \nSummarized financial information of the Obligor Group is as follows as of and for the fiscal years ended May 31:\nSummarized Consolidated Statements of Income\n(In thousands)\n2025\n2024\nNet sales to unrelated parties\n$\n9,813,929 \n$\n9,081,215 \nNet sales to non-guarantors\n$\n15,662 \n$\n12,432 \nOperating income\n$\n2,214,295 \n$\n1,957,473 \nNet income\n$\n1,677,277 \n$\n1,484,510 \nSummarized Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands)\n2025\n2024\nAssets\nReceivables due from non-obligor subsidiaries\n$\n59,346 \n$\n12,729 \nTotal other current assets\n$\n3,203,986 \n$\n2,973,225 \nTotal other noncurrent assets\n$\n5,972,476 \n$\n5,585,493 \nLiabilities \nAmounts due to non-obligor subsidiaries\n$\n93,926 \n$\n60,132 \nCurrent liabilities\n$\n1,560,058 \n$\n1,725,734 \nNoncurrent liabilities\n$\n3,429,841 \n$\n2,966,795 \n26\nContractual and Other Material Cash Obligations\nPayments Due by Period\n(In thousands)\nTotal\nOne year\nor less\nTwo to\nthree years\nFour to\nfive years\nAfter five\nyears\nDebt \n(1)\n$\n2,436,550 \n$\n— \n$\n1,400,000 \n$\n— \n$\n1,036,550 \nOperating leases \n(2)\n259,565 \n58,688 \n93,365 \n59,360 \n48,152 \nInterest payments\n501,830 \n100,348 \n156,129 \n93,096 \n152,257 \nTotal contractual and other material\n   cash obligations\n$\n3,197,945 \n$\n159,036 \n$\n1,649,494 \n$\n152,456 \n$\n1,236,959 \n(1)\nSee \nNote 6\n entitled Debt, Derivatives and Hedging Activities of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for a detailed presentation of Cintas' debt.\n(2)\nSee \nNote 7\n entitled Leases of \"Notes to Consolidated financial Statements\" for a detailed presentation of Cintas' operating leases. \nCintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans and may make payments to defined benefit plans to satisfy minimum funding requirements. The amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the Board. Future contributions to the defined contribution plans are expected to be $141.2 million in the next fiscal year, $304.0 million in the next two to three fiscal years and $335.1 million in the next four to five fiscal years. Future contributions to the defined benefit plans are expected to be $2.5 million in the next fiscal year, $10.0 million in the next two to three fiscal years and $8.4 million in the next four to five fiscal years. \nOther Commitments\nAmount of Commitment Expiration per Period\n(In thousands)\nTotal\nOne year\nor less\nTwo to\nthree years\nFour to\nfive years\nAfter five\nyears\nLines of credit \n(1)\n$\n1,999,298 \n$\n— \n$\n1,999,298 \n$\n— \n$\n— \nStandby letters of credit and surety bonds \n(2)\n129,576 \n129,576 \n— \n— \n— \nTotal other commitments\n$\n2,128,874 \n$\n129,576 \n$\n1,999,298 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n(1)\nBack-up facility for the commercial paper program (reference \nNote 6\n entitled Debt, Derivatives and Hedging Activities of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for further discussion).\n(2)\nThese standby letters of credit and surety bonds support certain outstanding debt (reference \nNote 6\n entitled Debt, Derivatives and Hedging Activities of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\"), self-insured workers' compensation and general liability insurance programs.\nInflation and Changing Prices\nChanges in wages, benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact Cintas' consolidated results of operations. In fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, we experienced impacts from inflation, including, but not limited to, higher labor, fuel and transportation costs. Management has been able to mitigate these inflationary pressures through pricing and various efficiency initiatives. Management has mitigated these impacts such that net of the mitigation strategy and initiatives, inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on Cintas' consolidated financial condition or a negative impact on the consolidated results of operations. \nLitigation and Other Contingencies\nCintas is subject to legal proceedings, insurance receipts, legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of Cintas. Cintas is also party to additional litigation not considered in the ordinary course of business. See \nNote 15\n entitled Litigation and Other Contingencies of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" for a detailed discussion of such additional litigation.\n27\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), \nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures \n(ASU 2023-07). ASU 2023-07 requires additional disclosures pertaining to significant expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and other items of an entity’s reportable operating segments. This standard was adopted by Cintas on May 31, 2025 and did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740), \nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\n (ASU 2023-09), which expands disclosures in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 (fiscal 2026). The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): \nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n (ASU 2024-03), which requires, among other items, additional disaggregated disclosures in the notes to financial statements for certain categories of expenses that are included on the face of the statement of income. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 (fiscal 2028), and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027 (fiscal 2029), with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2024-03 on the consolidated financial statements.\nThere are no other accounting pronouncements recently issued or newly effective that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on Cintas' consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThese critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with \nNote 1\n entitled Significant Accounting Policies of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\" The preparation of Cintas' consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments, specifically the insurance reserve, which have an effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant changes in critical accounting policies or significant changes in estimates or assumptions, specifically related to the insurance reserve, could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. \nRevenue recognition.  \nApproximately 95% of the Company's revenue is derived from fees for route servicing of Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and Fire Protection Services customers, performed by a Cintas employee-partner, at the customer's location of business. Revenue from our route servicing customer contracts represent a single-performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue over time as services are performed, based on the nature of services provided and contractual rates (output method) or at a point in time when the performance obligation under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied, at the customer's location of business. The Company's remaining revenue, primarily within the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment, and representing approximately 5% of the Company's total revenue, is recognized when the obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. This generally occurs when the goods are transferred to the customer. \nRevenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are treated as fulfillment activities and are recorded in both revenue and cost of sales at the time control is transferred to the customer. Certain of our customer contracts include pricing terms and conditions that include components of variable consideration. The variable consideration is typically in the form of consideration paid to a customer based on performance metrics specified within the contract and is not material in any period presented. When determining if variable consideration should be constrained, the Company considers whether factors outside its control could result in a significant reversal of revenue. In making these assessments, the Company considers the likelihood and magnitude of a potential reversal. The Company's performance period generally corresponds with the monthly invoice period. No constraints on our revenue recognition were applied during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2025, 2024 or 2023. See \nNote 2\n entitled Revenue Recognition of \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\". \n28\nUniforms and other rental items in service.  \nUniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom garments) are amortized over their useful lives, which range from 18 to 30 months. Other rental items, including shop towels, mats, mops, cleanroom garments, linens and restroom dispensers, are amortized over their useful lives, which range from 8 to 60 months. The amortization rates used are based on industry experience, Cintas' specific experience and wear tests performed by Cintas. These factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and facility services that are presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nInsurance reserve.  \nThe insurance reserve represents the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims (incurred but not reported), primarily related to workers' compensation, auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates. Our incurred but not reported reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures, with the assistance of third-party actuarial specialists, of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history. Cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims, higher claims activity and other industry factors in the period in which it becomes known. These changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements.",
