  "item1": "Item 1.  BUSINESS\nThe Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company) is a holding company principally engaged, through its subsidiaries, in providing a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations and individuals. The Company is incorporated as a general business corporation under the laws of the State of Minnesota and is one of the oldest insurance organizations in the United States, dating back to 1853. The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 485 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, and its telephone number is (917) 778-6000.  The Company also maintains executive offices in Hartford, Connecticut, and St. Paul, Minnesota.  The term “TRV” in this document refers to The Travelers Companies, Inc., the parent holding company excluding subsidiaries.\nPROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS\nThe property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive in the areas of price, service, product offerings, agent and broker relationships and other methods of distribution.  Distribution methods include the use of local and national independent agents and brokers, agency aggregators and carrier-based agencies, as well as direct to consumer, affinity and other partner platforms.  According to A.M. Best, there are approximately 1,100 property and casualty groups in the United States, comprising approximately 2,600 property and casualty companies.  Of those groups, the top 150 accounted for approximately 94% of the consolidated industry’s total net written premiums in 2023.  The Company competes with both foreign and domestic insurers.  In addition, some property and casualty insurers writing commercial lines of business, including the Company, offer products for alternative forms of risk protection in addition to traditional insurance products.  These products include large deductible programs and various forms of self-insurance, some of which utilize captive insurance companies and risk retention groups.  The Company’s competitive position in the marketplace is based on many factors, including the following:\n•\nability to profitably price business, retain existing customers and obtain new business;\n•\npremiums charged, contract terms and conditions, products and services offered (including the ability to design customized programs);\n•\nagent, broker and policyholder relationships;\n•\nability to keep pace relative to competitors with changes in technology and information systems, including artificial intelligence;\n•\nability to use data and analytics to make decisions;\n•\nspeed of claims payment;\n•\nability to provide a positive customer experience;\n•\nability to provide products and services in a cost effective manner;\n•\nability to provide new products and services to meet changing customer needs;\n•\nability to adapt to changes in business models, technology, customer preferences or regulation impacting the markets in which the Company operates;\n•\nperceived overall financial strength and corresponding ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;\n•\nability to recruit and retain qualified employees;\n•\ngeographic scope of business; and\n•\nlocal presence.\nIn addition, the marketplace is affected by the available capacity of the insurance industry, as measured by statutory capital and surplus, and the availability of reinsurance from both traditional sources, such as reinsurance companies and capital markets (through catastrophe bonds), and non-traditional sources, such as hedge funds and pension plans.  Industry capacity as measured by statutory capital and surplus expands and contracts primarily in conjunction with profit levels generated by the industry, less amounts returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  Capital raised by debt and equity offerings may also increase statutory capital and surplus.\nPricing and Underwriting\nPricing of the Company’s property and casualty insurance products is generally developed based upon an estimation of expected losses, the expenses associated with producing, issuing and servicing business and managing claims, the time value of money related to the expected loss and expense cash flows, and a reasonable profit margin that considers the capital needed to support the Company’s business.  The Company has a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that emphasizes product  returns and profitable growth over time rather than premium volume or market share. The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations regarding rate and policy form approvals.  The applicable state \n3\nlaws and regulations establish standards in certain lines of business to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or used to engage in unfair price competition.  The Company’s ability to increase rates and the relative timing of the process are dependent upon each respective state’s requirements, as well as the competitive market environment.\nGeographic Distribution\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of the Company’s consolidated direct written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nLocation\n% of Total\nDomestic:\n \nCalifornia\n10.5 \n%\nTexas \n(1)\n9.0 \nNew York\n8.2 \nFlorida\n4.1 \nPennsylvania\n4.1 \nIllinois\n3.7 \nGeorgia\n3.6 \nNew Jersey\n3.6 \nMassachusetts\n3.1 \nAll other domestic \n(2)\n45.0 \nTotal Domestic\n94.9 \n \n \nInternational:\n \nCanada\n2.8 \nAll other international\n2.3 \nTotal International\n5.1 \nConsolidated total\n100.0 \n%\n___________________________________________\n(1)\nThe percentage for Texas includes business written by the Company through a fronting agreement with another insurer.    \n(2)\nNo other single state accounted for 3.0% or more of the Company’s consolidated direct written premiums written in 2024.\nCatastrophe Exposure\nThe Company’s property and casualty insurance operations expose it to claims arising out of catastrophes.  The Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party modeling processes, to monitor and analyze underwriting risks of business in natural catastrophe-prone areas and target risk areas for conventional terrorist attacks (defined as attacks other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events).  The Company relies, in part, upon these analyses to make underwriting decisions designed to manage its exposure on catastrophe-exposed business.  For example, as a result of these analyses, the Company has at various times limited the writing of new property and homeowners business in some markets and has selectively taken underwriting actions on new and existing business.  These underwriting actions on new and existing business include tightening underwriting standards, selective price increases and changes to policy terms specific to hurricane-, tornado-, wind-, wildfire- and hail-prone areas.  See “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Catastrophe Modeling” and “—Changing Climate Conditions.”  The Company also utilizes reinsurance to manage its aggregate exposures to catastrophes.  See “—Reinsurance.”\nBUSINESS INSURANCE\nBusiness Insurance offers a broad array of property and casualty insurance products and services to its customers, primarily in the United States, as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and throughout other parts of the world, including as a corporate member of Lloyd’s.  Business Insurance is organized as follows:\n4\nDomestic\n•\nSelect Accounts \nprovides small businesses with property and casualty insurance products and services, including commercial multi-peril, workers’ compensation, commercial automobile, general liability and commercial property.\n•\nMiddle Market\n provides mid-sized businesses with property and casualty insurance products and services, including workers’ compensation, general liability, commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and commercial property, as well as risk management, claims handling and other services.

Agencies and brokers are serviced by 88 field offices and supported by customer service centers where the Company performs services for agents for a fee and centralized business centers where the Company processes new and renewal business that meet certain underwriting criteria.\nBusiness Insurance builds relationships with well-established, independent insurance agencies and brokers.  In selecting new independent agencies and brokers to distribute its products, Business Insurance considers, among other factors, each agency’s or broker’s financial strength, staff experience and strategic fit with the Company’s operating and marketing plans. Once an agency or broker is appointed, Business Insurance regularly monitors its performance. The majority of products offered in the United States are distributed through independent agents and brokers, many of whom also sell the Company’s Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance products.  Business Insurance continues to make significant investments to enable real-time interface capabilities with its independent agencies and brokers.\nDomestic\n•\nSelect Accounts\n markets and distributes products and services to small businesses, generally with fewer than 50 employees, through a large network of independent agents and brokers.  Products offered by Select Accounts are guaranteed-cost policies, including packaged products covering property and liability exposures.  Each small business risk is independently evaluated via an automated underwriting platform which in turn enables agents to quote, bind and issue a substantial amount of new small business risks in an efficient manner.  Risks with more complex characteristics are underwritten with the assistance of Company personnel.\n•\nMiddle Market \nmarkets and distributes products and services primarily to mid-sized businesses with 50 to 1,000 employees through a large network of independent agents and brokers.  The Company offers a full line of products to its Middle Market customers with an emphasis on guaranteed-cost programs.  Each account is underwritten based on the unique risk characteristics, loss history and coverage needs of the account.  The ability to underwrite at this detailed level allows Middle Market to have a broad risk appetite and a diversified customer base.  Within Middle Market, products and services are tailored to certain targeted industry segments of significant size and complexity that require unique underwriting, claims handling services, risk management or other insurance-related products and services.\n6\n•\nNational Accounts\n markets and distributes products and services to large companies through a large network of national and regional brokers.  Products offered by National Accounts are primarily casualty programs that utilize loss-sensitive products, such as large deductible, and to a lesser extent, retrospectively rated insurance and self-insured retention plans.    National Accounts also offers insurance-related services, such as claims administration, risk management, loss control and risk management information services through Constitution State Services LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.   The commercial residual market business of National Accounts services approximately 36% of the total workers’ compensation assigned risk market, making the Company one of the largest servicing carriers in the industry.\n•\nNational Property and Other \nmarkets and distributes products and services to a wide customer base, providing traditional and customized insurance programs to a broad range of customer sizes through a large network of agents and brokers.  National Property and Other also provides insurance coverage to the excess and surplus lines market, which is characterized by the absence of regulation related to rate and form, and allows for more pricing and coverage flexibility to write certain classes of business.  In working with agents or program managers on a brokerage basis, National Property and Other underwrites the business internally and sets the premium level.  In working with agents or program managers with delegated underwriting authority, the agents produce and underwrite business subject to pricing and underwriting guidelines that have been specifically designed for each facility or program.\nInternational\n markets and distributes products and services principally through brokers in each of the countries in which it operates.  International also writes business at Lloyd’s, where its products are distributed through Lloyd’s wholesale and retail brokers.  By virtue of Lloyd’s worldwide licenses, Business Insurance has access to international markets across the world.\nEffective January 1, 2025, the Company renewed a quota share reinsurance agreement with subsidiaries of Fidelis Insurance Holdings Limited (Fidelis) for 2025 pursuant to which the Company assumes 20% of the subject gross written premiums of Fidelis on a risk-attaching basis, subject to a loss ratio cap.  The Company’s portion of premiums from Fidelis is reported as part of the International results of Business Insurance.  The Company also has a minority investment in Fidelis.\nPricing and Underwriting\nBusiness Insurance utilizes underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial and product development disciplines for particular industries, together with extensive amounts of proprietary data gathered and analyzed over many years, as well as third-party data, to facilitate its risk selection process and develop pricing parameters.  Business Insurance utilizes both proprietary forms and standard industry forms for the insurance policies it issues.\nA portion of business in this segment, particularly in National Accounts and Construction, is written with large deductible insurance policies. Under workers’ compensation insurance contracts with large deductible features, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible amount and, as a result, is subject to credit risk until such reimbursement is made. At December 31, 2024, contractholder payables on unpaid losses within the deductible layer of large deductible policies were approximately $3.19 billion, and the associated receivables (net of allowance for expected credit losses) were approximately $3.17 billion. Business Insurance also utilizes retrospectively rated policies for a portion of its business, primarily for workers’ compensation coverage.  Although the retrospectively rated feature of the policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it introduces additional credit risk to the Company. Premiums receivable from holders of retrospectively rated policies totaled approximately $46 million at December 31, 2024.  Significant collateral, primarily letters of credit and, to a lesser extent, cash collateral, trusts or surety bonds, is generally obtained for large deductible plans and/or retrospectively rated policies that provide for deferred collection of deductible recoveries and/or ultimate premiums. The amount of collateral requested is based upon the creditworthiness of the customer and the nature of the insured risks.  Business Insurance regularly monitors the credit exposure on individual accounts and the adequacy of collateral.   For additional information concerning credit risk in certain of the Company’s businesses, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—We are exposed to credit risk in certain of our insurance operations and with respect to certain guarantee or indemnification arrangements that we have with third parties.” \nProduct Lines\nBusiness Insurance provides the following types of coverages:\nDomestic\n•\nWorkers’ Compensation.  \nProvides coverage for employers for specified benefits payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries to employees. There are typically four types of benefits payable under workers’ compensation policies: medical benefits, disability benefits, death benefits and vocational rehabilitation benefits. The Company emphasizes \n7\nmanaged care cost containment strategies, which involve employers, employees and care providers in a collaborative effort that focuses on the injured employee’s early return to work and cost-effective quality care.  \n•\nCommercial Automobile.\n  Provides coverage for businesses against losses incurred from personal bodily injury, bodily injury to third parties, property damage to an insured’s vehicle and property damage to other vehicles and other property resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of automobiles and trucks in a business.\n•\nCommercial Property.\n  Provides coverage for loss of or damage to buildings, inventory and equipment resulting from a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes and other windstorms, tornadoes, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, theft, vandalism, fires, explosions, terrorism and financial loss due to business interruption resulting from covered property damage. Commercial property also includes specialized equipment insurance, which provides coverage for loss or damage resulting from the mechanical breakdown of boilers and machinery, and ocean and inland marine insurance, which provides coverage for goods in transit and unique, one-of-a-kind exposures.\n•\nGeneral Liability. \n Provides coverages for businesses against third-party claims arising from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations, including as a result of injuries sustained from products sold.  Coverages may also include directors’ and officers’ liability arising in their official capacities, employment practices liability insurance, fiduciary liability for trustees and sponsors of pension, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans, errors and omissions insurance for employees, agents, professionals and others arising from acts or failures to act under specified circumstances, cyber liability, as well as umbrella and excess insurance.  \n•\nCommercial Multi-Peril.\n  Provides a combination of the property and liability coverages described in the foregoing product line descriptions.\nThe Company offers the above coverages through the following types of products and services: \n•\nguaranteed-cost insurance products, where the premiums charged are not adjusted for actual loss experience during the covered period; \n•\nloss-sensitive insurance products, including large deductible and retrospectively rated policies, where fees or premiums are adjusted based on actual loss experience of the insured during the policy period; and \n•\nservice programs, which are generally sold to the Company’s National Accounts customers, where the Company receives fees rather than premiums for providing insurance-related services, such as claims administration, risk management, loss control and risk management information services.\nThe Company also participates in state assigned risk pools as a servicing carrier and pool participant.\nInternational\n•\nProvides coverage for employers’ liability (similar to workers’ compensation coverage in the United States), public and product liability (the equivalent of general liability), professional indemnity (similar to professional liability coverage), commercial property, commercial automobile, marine, aviation, onshore and offshore energy, construction, terrorism, personal accident and kidnap & ransom. Marine provides coverage for ship hulls, cargoes carried, private yachts, marine-related liability, ports and terminals, and fine art.  Aviation provides coverage for worldwide aviation risks, including physical damage and liabilities for airline, aerospace, general aviation, aviation war and space risks.  Personal accident provides financial protection in the event of death or disablement due to accidental bodily injury, while kidnap & ransom provides financial protection against kidnap, hijack, illegal detention and extortion.  While the covered hazards may be similar to those in the U.S. market, the different legal environments can make the product risks and coverage terms very different from those the Company faces in the United States.\nNet Retention Policy Per Risk\nThe following discussion reflects the Company’s retention policy with respect to Business Insurance as of January 1, 2025.  For third-party liability, Business Insurance generally limits its net retention, through the use of reinsurance, to a maximum of $6.7 million per insured, per occurrence, subject further to a significant aggregate annual deductible. For property exposures, Business Insurance generally limits its net retention, through the use of reinsurance, to a maximum amount per risk of $20.0 million per occurrence.  Business Insurance generally retains its workers’ compensation exposures.  Reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in larger net per-risk retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are reached.  Business Insurance utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual \n8\nrisk basis. Business Insurance may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.\nGeographic Distribution\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of Business Insurance’s direct written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nLocation\n% of Total\nDomestic:\n \nCalifornia\n13.2 \n%\nNew York\n8.2 \nTexas\n7.6 \nIllinois\n4.3 \nFlorida\n4.1 \nPennsylvania\n3.7 \nNew Jersey\n3.7 \nGeorgia\n3.1 \nAll other domestic \n(1)\n47.6 \nTotal Domestic\n95.5 \nInternational:\nCanada\n1.7 \nAll other international\n2.8 \nTotal International\n4.5 \nTotal Business Insurance\n100.0 \n%\n___________________________________________\n(1)\nNo other single state accounted for 3.0% or more of Business Insurance’s direct written premiums in 2024.\nCompetition\nThe insurance industry is represented in the commercial marketplace by many insurance companies of varying size as well as other entities offering risk alternatives, such as self-insured retentions or captive programs. Market competition operates within the insurance regulatory framework to set the price charged for insurance products and the levels of coverage and service provided.  A company’s success in the competitive commercial insurance landscape is largely measured by its ability to profitably provide insurance and services, including claims handling and risk management, at prices and terms that retain existing customers and attract new customers, as well as its financial strength.  See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—The intense competition that we face, including with respect to attracting and retaining employees, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which we operate, could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability.” \nDomestic\nCompetitors typically write Select Accounts business through independent agents and brokers and, to a lesser extent, as direct writers, including through affinity and other partner platforms.  Both national (including international companies doing business in the U.S.) and regional property and casualty insurance companies compete in the Select Accounts market which generally comprises lower-hazard, “Main Street” business customers. Risks are underwritten and priced using standard industry practices and a combination of proprietary and standard industry product offerings. Competition in this market is focused on ease and speed of doing business and price.\nCompetitors typically write Middle Market business through independent agents and brokers.  Several of Middle Market’s operations require unique combinations of industry knowledge, customized coverage, specialized risk control and loss handling services, along with partnerships with agents and brokers that also focus on these markets.  Competitors in this market are primarily national property and casualty insurance companies (including international companies doing business in the U.S.) that write most classes of business using traditional products and pricing, and regional insurance companies.  Companies compete based on product offerings, service levels, price, claim and loss prevention services and ease and speed of doing \n9\nbusiness.  Efficiency through automation and response time to agent, broker and customer needs is one key to success in this market.\nIn the National Accounts market, competition is based on price, product offerings, claim and loss prevention services, managed care cost containment, risk management information systems and collateral requirements.  National Accounts primarily competes with national property and casualty insurance companies (including international companies doing business in the U.S.), as well as with other underwriters of property and casualty insurance in the alternative risk transfer market, such as self-insurance plans, captives managed by others, third-party administrators and a variety of other risk-financing vehicles and mechanisms.  The residual market division competes for state contracts to provide claims and policy management services. \nNational Property and Other competes in focused target markets.  Each of these markets is different and requires unique combinations of industry knowledge, customized coverage, specialized risk management and claims handling services, along with partnerships with agents and brokers that also focus on these markets.  Some of these businesses compete with national carriers (including international companies doing business in the U.S.) with similarly dedicated underwriting and marketing groups, whereas others compete with smaller regional companies.  Specialized agents and brokers, including wholesale agents and program managers, supplement this focused target market approach.  National Property and Other’s competitive strategy typically is based on the application of focused industry knowledge to insurance and risk needs. \nInternational\nInternational competes with numerous international and domestic insurers in Canada, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.  Companies compete on the basis of price, product offerings, distribution partnerships, the level of claim and risk management services provided and the ease and speed of doing business.  The Company has developed expertise in various markets in these countries similar to those served in the United States and provides both property and casualty coverage for these markets.  \nAt Lloyd’s, International competes with other syndicates operating in the Lloyd’s market as well as international and domestic insurers in the various markets where the Lloyd’s operation writes business worldwide, with an emphasis on short-tail insurance lines.  Competition is based on price, product, distribution partnerships and service. \nBOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE\nBond & Specialty Insurance offers surety, fidelity, management liability, professional liability, and other property and casualty coverages and related risk management services to its customers, primarily in the United States, and certain surety and specialty insurance products in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Brazil (through a joint venture, as described below), in each case utilizing various degrees of financially-based underwriting approaches.  The range of coverages includes performance, payment and commercial surety bonds for construction and general commercial enterprises; management liability coverages including directors’ and officers’ liability, employment practices liability, fidelity liability, fiduciary liability and cyber risk for public corporations, private companies, not-for-profit organizations and financial institutions; professional liability coverage for a variety of professionals including, among others, lawyers and design professionals; in the United States only, property, workers’ compensation, auto and general liability for financial institutions; and transactional liability coverages to public and private companies.\nBond & Specialty Insurance’s surety business in Brazil is conducted through Junto Holding Brasil S.A. (Junto). The Company owns 49.5% of Junto, a market leader in surety coverages in Brazil. This joint venture investment is accounted for using the equity method and is included in “other investments” on the consolidated balance sheet.\nOn November 3, 2023, the Company announced an agreement to acquire Corvus Insurance Holdings, Inc. (Corvus), a cyber insurance managing general underwriter. On January 2, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Corvus. \nSelected Product Information\nThe following table sets forth Bond & Specialty Insurance’s net written premiums by product line for the periods indicated.

Bond & Specialty Insurance builds relationships with well-established, independent insurance agencies and brokers. In selecting new independent agencies and brokers to distribute its products, Bond & Specialty Insurance considers, among other factors, each agency’s or broker’s profitability, financial stability, staff experience and strategic fit with its operating and marketing plans. Once an agency or broker is appointed, its ongoing performance is regularly monitored.  Bond & Specialty Insurance continues to make investments to enable real-time interface capabilities with its independent agencies and brokers. Bond & Specialty Insurance also writes certain products through managing general agents and managing general underwriters.\nPricing and Underwriting\nBond & Specialty Insurance utilizes underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial and product development disciplines for specific accounts and industries, together with extensive amounts of proprietary data gathered and analyzed over many years, as well as third-party data, to facilitate its risk selection process and develop pricing parameters.  Bond & Specialty Insurance utilizes both proprietary forms and standard industry forms for the insurance policies and bonds it issues. \nProduct Lines\nBond & Specialty Insurance writes the following types of coverages:\nDomestic\n•\nFidelity and Surety.\n  Provides fidelity insurance coverage, which protects an insured for loss due to embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an employee, and surety, which is a three-party agreement whereby the surety company agrees to pay a third party or to complete an obligation in response to the default, acts or omissions of a bonded party. Surety bonds are generally provided for construction performance; legal matters, such as appeals; compliance and licensing; and other performance obligations.\n•\nGeneral Liability.\n  Provides coverage for specialized liability exposures as described above in more detail in the “Business Insurance” section of this report, as well as transactional liability coverages.\n•\nOther.\n  Coverages include Commercial Property, Workers’ Compensation, Commercial Automobile and Commercial Multi-Peril, which are described above in more detail in the “Business Insurance” section of this report.\nInternational\n•\nFidelity and Surety and certain General Liability products are provided internationally to various customer groups.\nNet Retention Policy Per Risk\nThe following discussion reflects the Company’s retention policy with respect to Bond & Specialty Insurance as of January 1, 2025.  For management liability coverages, including but not limited to directors’ and officers’ liability, professional liability, employment practices liability, fidelity liability, fiduciary liability and cyber risk liability, Bond & Specialty Insurance generally limits net retentions to $25.0 million per policy. For surety, where limits are often significant, Bond & Specialty Insurance generally retains up to $160.0 million probable maximum loss (PML) per principal, after reinsurance, but may retain higher amounts based on the type of obligation, credit quality and other credit risk factors.  Reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in larger net per risk retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are reached.  Bond & Specialty Insurance utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual \n11\nrisk basis. Bond & Specialty Insurance may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk. \nGeographic Distribution\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of Bond & Specialty Insurance’s direct written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nLocation\n% of Total\nDomestic:\n \nCalifornia\n10.1 \n%\nTexas\n7.5 \nNew York\n6.5 \nFlorida\n4.7 \nIllinois\n3.8 \nPennsylvania\n3.4 \nAll other domestic \n(1)\n51.9 \nTotal Domestic\n87.9 \n \n \nInternational:\n \nUnited Kingdom\n5.7 \nCanada\n4.1 \nAll other international\n2.3 \nTotal International\n12.1 \nTotal Bond & Specialty Insurance\n100.0 \n%\n___________________________________________\n(1)\nNo other single state accounted for 3.0% or more of Bond & Specialty Insurance’s direct written premiums in 2024.\nCompetition\nThe competitive landscape in which Bond & Specialty Insurance operates is affected by many of the same factors described above for Business Insurance.  Competitors in this market are primarily national property and casualty insurance companies (including international companies doing business in the U.S.) that write most classes of business and, to a lesser extent, regional insurance companies and companies that have developed niche programs for specific industry segments. \nDomestic\nBond & Specialty Insurance underwrites and markets its products to all sizes of businesses and other organizations, as well as individuals.  The Company believes that its reputation for timely and consistent decision making and financial stability, a nationwide network of local underwriting, claims and industry experts and strong producer and customer relationships, as well as its ability to offer its customers a full range of products and services, provides Bond & Specialty Insurance an advantage over many of its competitors and enables it to compete effectively in a complex, dynamic marketplace. The Company believes that the ability of Bond & Specialty Insurance to cross-sell its products to customers of Business Insurance and Personal Insurance also provides the Company with a competitive advantage.  See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—The intense competition that we face, including with respect to attracting and retaining employees, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which we operate, could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability.”\nInternational\nInternational competes with numerous international and domestic insurers in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and in Brazil through a joint venture. Companies compete on the basis of price, product offerings, distribution partnerships, the level of claim and risk management services provided, the ease and speed of doing business and stability of the insurer.  The Company has developed expertise in various markets in these countries similar to those served in the United States and provides certain specialty coverages for these markets.\n12\nPERSONAL INSURANCE\nPersonal Insurance offers a broad range of property and casualty insurance products and services covering individuals’ personal risks, primarily in the United States, as well as in Canada. Personal Insurance’s primary products of automobile and homeowners insurance are complemented by a broad suite of related coverages.\nSelected Product and Distribution Channel Information\nThe following table sets forth net written premiums for Personal Insurance’s business by product line for the periods indicated.  For a description of the product lines referred to in the following table, see “—Product Lines.” In addition, see “—Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution” for a discussion of distribution channels for Personal Insurance’s product lines.\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n% of Total 2024\nDomestic:\n \n \n \n \nAutomobile\n$\n7,925\n \n$\n7,330 \n$\n6,482 \n46.2\n \n%\nHomeowners and Other\n8,550\n \n7,949 \n6,916 \n49.8\n \nTotal Domestic\n16,475\n \n15,279 \n13,398 \n96.0\n \nInternational\n694\n \n650 \n649 \n4.0\n \nTotal Personal Insurance\n$\n17,169\n \n$\n15,929 \n$\n14,047 \n100.0\n \n%\nPrincipal Markets and Methods of Distribution\nDomestic\n \nPersonal Insurance products are marketed and distributed primarily through thousands of independent agents and brokers located throughout the United States, supported by personnel in seven sales regions. In addition, sales and service are provided to customers through contact centers.  Principal markets for Personal Insurance products are spread throughout the contiguous United States. \nIn selecting new independent agencies to distribute its products, Personal Insurance considers many factors, including financial stability, staff experience, lead sources, customer facing online and digital capabilities and operating and marketing plans.  Once an agency is appointed, Personal Insurance regularly monitors its performance.  \nAgents can access the Company’s agency service portal for a number of resources, including customer service, marketing and claims management.  In addition, agencies can choose to shift the ongoing service responsibility for Personal Insurance’s customers to the Company’s Customer Care Program, where the Company provides, on behalf of an agency, a comprehensive array of customer service needs, including billing inquiries, coverage discussions and account changes.  Approximately two thousand agencies take advantage of this service alternative, for which they generally pay a fee.\nPersonal Insurance also markets and distributes its products directly to consumers, largely through direct mail and digital marketing, and through affinity partners, including employers, credit unions and consumer associations.  Personal Insurance handles the sales for these programs through the Company’s contact center locations and the Company’s wholly owned independent agency.  Personal Insurance also markets and distributes its products on other distribution platforms, including carrier partnerships. Since 1995, the Company has had a distribution agreement with the agency affiliate of GEICO to underwrite a portion of their homeowners business.\nInternational\nIn Canada, the Company markets and distributes its personal insurance products principally through hundreds of brokers located throughout the country.\nPricing and Underwriting\nPersonal Insurance has developed a product management methodology that integrates the disciplines of underwriting, claims, actuarial and product development. This approach is designed to maintain high-quality underwriting discipline and pricing segmentation.  Proprietary and third-party data accumulated over many years is analyzed, and Personal Insurance uses a variety of risk differentiation models to facilitate its pricing segmentation and underwriting. The Company’s product management area establishes underwriting guidelines integrated with its filed pricing and rating plans, which enable Personal Insurance to effectively execute its risk selection and pricing processes. \n13\nDomestic\nPricing for personal automobile insurance is driven in large part by changes in the frequency of claims and changes in severity, including inflation in the cost of automobile replacements and repairs (including parts and labor), medical care and resolution of liability claims.  Pricing in the homeowners business is driven in large part by changes in the frequency of claims and changes in severity, including inflation in the cost of materials, labor and household possessions.  In addition to the normal risks associated with any multiple peril coverage, the profitability and pricing of both homeowners and automobile insurance are affected by the incidence of catastrophes and other weather-related events, as well as other unusual circumstances, such as the impact of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and elevated inflation.  Insurers writing personal lines property and casualty policies may be unable to change prices until some time after the costs associated with coverage have changed, primarily because of state insurance rate regulation. The pace at which an insurer can change rates in response to changing costs depends, in part, on whether the applicable state law requires prior approval of rate changes or notification to the regulator either before or after a rate change is imposed. In states with prior approval laws, rates must be approved by the regulator before being used by the insurer. In states having “file-and-use” laws, the insurer must file rate changes with the regulator, but does not need to wait for approval before using the new rates.  A “use-and-file” law requires an insurer to file rates within a period of time after the insurer begins using the new rate. Approximately one-half of the states require prior approval of most rate changes.  In addition, changes to methods of marketing and underwriting in some jurisdictions are subject to state-imposed restrictions, which can make it more difficult for an insurer to significantly manage catastrophe exposures.  \nThe Company’s ability or willingness to change prices, modify underwriting terms or shift exposure to, or from, certain geographies may be limited due to a number of factors, including public policy, the competitive environment, the evolving political and legislative environment and/or changes in the general economic climate.  The Company also may choose to write business it might not otherwise write in some states for strategic purposes, such as improving access to other commercial or personal underwriting opportunities.  In choosing to write business in some states, the Company also considers the costs and benefits of those states’ residual markets and guaranty funds, as well as other property and casualty business the Company writes in those states.  \nInternational\nPricing and underwriting for personal automobile and homeowners insurance in Canada is driven in large part by the same factors as in the United States.  For personal automobile insurance, all provinces in Canada require prior approval before rates are implemented.  In contrast, for personal homeowners insurance, none of the provinces in Canada require regulatory filing or approval, enabling more efficient implementation of product changes into the market.\nProduct Lines\nDomestic\nThe primary coverages in Personal Insurance are personal automobile and homeowners and other insurance sold to individuals.  Personal Insurance had approximately 8.8 million active policies (i.e., policies-in-force) in the United States at December 31, 2024.\nPersonal Insurance writes the following types of coverages:\n•\nAutomobile\n provides coverage for liability to others for both bodily injury and property damage, uninsured motorist protection, and for physical damage to an insured’s own vehicle from collision, fire, flood, hail and theft.  In addition, many states require policies to provide first-party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.\n•\nHomeowners and Other \nprovides protection against losses to dwellings and contents from a variety of perils (excluding flooding) as well as coverage for personal liability. The Company writes homeowners insurance for dwellings, condominiums and tenants, and rental properties.  The Company also writes coverage for boats and yachts, valuable personal items such as jewelry, umbrella liability, and weddings and special events.\nInternational\n•\nInternational\n provides automobile and homeowners and other coverages in Canada (similar to coverages in the United States).  Personal Insurance had approximately 425,000 active policies in Canada at December 31, 2024.\n14\nNet Retention Policy Per Risk\nThe following discussion reflects the Company’s retention policy with respect to Personal Insurance as of January 1, 2025.  Personal Insurance generally retains its primary personal auto exposures in their entirety.  For personal property insurance, there is an $8.0 million maximum retention per risk, net of reinsurance.  Personal Insurance uses facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis.  Personal Insurance issues umbrella policies up to a maximum limit of $10.0 million per risk. Personal Insurance may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.\nGeographic Distribution\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of Personal Insurance’s direct written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nLocation\n% of Total\nDomestic:\n \nTexas \n(1)\n11.3 \n%\nNew York\n8.7 \nCalifornia\n6.9 \nGeorgia\n4.7 \nPennsylvania\n4.7 \nFlorida\n4.1 \nNew Jersey\n3.9 \nMaryland\n3.7 \nVirginia\n3.5 \nColorado\n3.5 \nMassachusetts\n3.5 \nIllinois\n3.0 \nConnecticut\n3.0 \nAll other domestic \n(2)\n31.5 \nTotal Domestic\n96.0 \nInternational:\n \nCanada\n4.0 \nTotal International\n4.0 \n     Total Personal Insurance\n100.0 \n%\n___________________________________________\n(1)\nThe percentage for Texas includes business written by the Company through a fronting agreement with another insurer.\n(2)\nNo other single state accounted for 3.0% or more of Personal Insurance’s direct written premiums in 2024.\nCompetition\nDomestic\nAlthough national companies (including international companies doing business in the U.S.) write the majority of this business, Personal Insurance also faces competition from many regional and local companies.  Competitors write business in both traditional and alternative distribution platforms through independent agents and as direct writers, either through the use of exclusive agents, salaried employees or direct marketing strategies.  Personal Insurance primarily competes based on breadth of product offerings, price, service (including claims handling), partner and customer experience, stability of the insurer and name recognition.  In the independent agent channel, Personal Insurance competes for business within each independent agency since these agencies also offer policies from competing companies.  Most independent personal insurance agents utilize price comparison rating technology, sometimes referred to as “comparative raters,” as a cost-efficient means of obtaining quotes from multiple companies.  Because the use of this technology facilitates the process of generating multiple quotes, the technology has increased price comparison on new and renewal business. \n15\nInternational\nPersonal Insurance competes with numerous international and domestic insurers in Canada.  Companies compete based on similar factors to those described above for domestic operations.  The Company has developed expertise in various markets in Canada similar to those served in the United States and provides both automobile and homeowners and other coverages for this market. \nSee “Item 1A—Risk Factors—The intense competition that we face, including with respect to attracting and retaining employees, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which we operate, could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability.”\nCLAIMS MANAGEMENT\nThe Company’s claim functions are managed through its Claims Services organization, with locations in the United States and in the other countries where it does business.  With approximately 12,700 employees, Claims Services employs a group of professionals with diverse skills, including claim adjusters, appraisers, attorneys, investigators, engineers, accountants, nurses, data and analytics professionals, system specialists and training, management and support personnel.  Approved external service providers, such as investigators, attorneys and, when necessary, independent adjusters and appraisers, are available for use as appropriate. \nUnited States field claim management teams located in 16 claim centers and 56 satellite and specialty-only offices in 42 states are organized to maintain focus on the specific claim characteristics unique to the businesses within the Company’s business segments. Claim teams with specialized skills, required licenses, resources and workflows are matched to the unique exposures of those businesses, with local claims management dedicated to achieving optimal results within each segment, including acting as a third-party administrator for large customers who self-insure and retain the Company to handle their claims process on a fee-for-service basis.  The Company’s home office operations provide additional support in the form of workflow design, quality management, information technology, advanced management information and data analysis, training, financial reporting and controls, and human resources strategy.  This structure permits the Company to maintain the economies of scale of a large, established company while retaining the agility to respond promptly to the needs of customers, brokers, agents and underwriters.  Claims management for International, while generally provided locally by staff in the respective international locations due to local knowledge of applicable laws and regulations, is also managed by the Company’s Claims Services organization in the United States to leverage that knowledge base and to share best practices.  \nAn integral part of the Company’s strategy to benefit customers and shareholders is its continuing industry leadership in the fight against insurance fraud through its Investigative Services unit.  The Company has a nationwide staff of experts who investigate a wide array of insurance fraud schemes using in-house forensic resources and other technological tools.  This staff also has specialized expertise in fire scene examinations, medical provider fraud schemes, law firm fraud schemes and data mining.  The Company also dedicates investigative resources to ensure that violations of law are reported to and prosecuted by law enforcement agencies.  \nClaims Services uses technology, management information and data analysis to assist the Company in reviewing its claim practices and results in order to evaluate and improve its claims management performance. The Company’s claims-management strategy is focused on segmentation of claims and appropriate technical specialization to drive effective claim resolution. The Company regularly monitors its investment in claim resources to maintain an effective focus on claim outcomes and a disciplined approach to continual improvement.  The Company operates a state-of-the-art claims-training facility which offers hands-on experiential learning to help ensure that its claim professionals are properly trained.  In recent years, the Company has invested significant additional resources in many of its claims handling operations, including digital, analytics, artificial intelligence and automation capabilities. The Company regularly monitors the effect of these investments to ensure a consistent optimization among outcomes, cost and service.\nClaims Services’ catastrophe response strategy is to respond to a significant catastrophic event using its own personnel, enabling it to minimize reliance on independent adjusters and appraisers.  The Company has developed a large, dedicated Catastrophe Response Team and has also trained a large Enterprise Response Team of existing employees.  The latter team can be deployed on short notice in the event of a catastrophe that generates claim volume exceeding the capacity of the dedicated Catastrophe Response Team.  In recent years, these internal resources and expanded digital capabilities were successfully deployed to respond to a significant level of catastrophe claims.\n16\nREINSURANCE\nThe Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to manage its exposure to losses and to protect its capital.  The Company cedes to reinsurers a portion of these risks and pays premiums based upon the risk and exposure of the policies subject to such reinsurance.  The Company utilizes a variety of reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to large property and casualty losses, including facultative as well as catastrophe and individual risk treaties.  Ceded reinsurance involves credit risk, except with regard to mandatory pools and associations, and is predominantly subject to aggregate loss limits. Although the reinsurer is liable to the Company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, the Company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured.  Reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts. The Company also holds collateral, including trust agreements, escrow funds and letters of credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. The Company monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on a regular basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements periodically. Reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition, business practices, the price of their product offerings and the value of collateral provided. After reinsurance is purchased, the Company has limited ability to manage the credit risk of a reinsurer.  In addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the European Union and the United Kingdom and a small number of U.S. states, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less creditworthy, without a counterparty’s consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority.\nFor additional information regarding reinsurance, see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and “Item 1A—Risk Factors—We may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers, reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all and we are exposed to credit risk related to our structured settlements.”  For a description of reinsurance-related litigation, see note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \nCatastrophe Reinsurance\nCatastrophes include hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, solar flares and other naturally-occurring events.  Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other destructive acts including those involving cyber events, nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, civil unrest, explosions and destruction of infrastructure.  The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, cyber attacks and other events may produce significant damage or loss in larger areas, especially those areas that are heavily populated. For additional information regarding catastrophes, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas and changing climate conditions, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.”  The Company generally seeks to manage its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance.  In addition to the Company’s catastrophe reinsurance coverages, the Company is also party to other reinsurance treaties that can provide additional coverage for losses arising from catastrophes, as described in the “Net Retention Policy Per Risk” sections of the respective segment discussions above.  The Company conducts reviews of its risk and catastrophe coverages on a regular basis and makes changes as it deems appropriate.  The following discussion summarizes the Company’s catastrophe reinsurance coverage at January 1, 2025.\nCorporate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty.  \nThis treaty covers the accumulation of certain property losses arising from one or multiple occurrences for the period January 1, 2025, through and including December 31, 2025.  The treaty provides for recovery of 80% of each qualifying loss in excess of a $4.0 billion retention up to $5.0 billion, 95% of losses in excess of $5.0 billion up to $7.5 billion and 100% of losses in excess of $7.5 billion up to $8.0 billion. Therefore, the maximum recovery under the treaty would be $3.7 billion, or 92%, of the total $4.0 billion limit. Qualifying losses for each occurrence are after a $100 million deductible.  The treaty covers all of the Company’s exposures in North America and all waters contiguous thereto.  The treaty only provides coverage for terrorism events in limited circumstances and excludes entirely losses arising from nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.  The treaty only provides coverage for cyber events and civil unrest in limited circumstances and excludes losses arising from communicable disease.  The Company’s underlying insurance coverages generally exclude coverage for communicable disease.\n17\nCatastrophe Bonds\n. The Company has catastrophe protection through an indemnity reinsurance agreement with Long Point Re IV Ltd. (Long Point Re IV), an independent Bermuda company registered as a special purpose insurer under the Bermuda Insurance Act of 1978 and related regulations.  The reinsurance agreement meets the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with the guidance for reinsurance contracts.  In connection with the reinsurance agreement, Long Point Re IV issued notes (generally referred to as “catastrophe bonds”) to investors in amounts equal to the full coverage provided under the reinsurance agreement as described below.  The proceeds of the issuance were deposited in a reinsurance trust account.  The businesses covered by this reinsurance agreement are subsets of the Company’s overall insurance portfolio, comprising specified property coverages spread across the following geographic locations: Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia.\nThe reinsurance agreement provides coverage of up to $575 million to the Company through May 24, 2026 for certain losses from tropical cyclones, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms or winter storms in the locations listed above.  The attachment point and maximum limit under this agreement are reset annually to adjust the expected loss of the layer within a predetermined range. For events up to and including May 24, 2025, this treaty provides up to $575 million of coverage, subject to a $2.8 billion retention. The coverage under the reinsurance agreement is limited to specified property coverage written in Personal Insurance; Select Accounts, Middle Market (excluding Excess Casualty and Boiler & Machinery) and National Property and Other in Business Insurance; and Other in Bond & Specialty Insurance.\nUnder the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the Company is obligated to pay annual reinsurance premiums to Long Point Re IV for the reinsurance coverage.  Amounts payable to the Company under the reinsurance agreement with respect to any covered event cannot exceed the Company’s actual losses from such event.  The principal amount of the catastrophe bonds will be reduced by any amounts paid to the Company under the reinsurance agreement. \nAs with any reinsurance agreement, there is credit risk associated with collecting amounts due from reinsurers. With regard to Long Point Re IV, the credit risk is mitigated by a reinsurance trust account that has been funded by Long Point Re IV with money market funds that invest solely in direct government obligations and obligations backed by the U.S. government with maturities of no more than 13 months. The money market funds must have a principal stability rating of at least AAAm by Standard & Poor’s or AAAmmf by Fitch Ratings on the issuance date of the bonds and thereafter must be rated by Standard & Poor’s or Fitch Ratings, as applicable. Other permissible investments include money market funds which invest in repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by direct government obligations and obligations of any agency backed by the U.S. government with terms of no more than 397 calendar days, and cash.\nAt the time the agreement was entered into with Long Point Re IV, the Company evaluated the applicability of the accounting guidance that addresses variable interest entities or VIEs.  Under this guidance, an entity that is formed for business purposes is considered a VIE if: (a) the equity investors lack the direct or indirect ability through voting rights or similar rights to make decisions about an entity’s activities that have a significant effect on the entity’s operations or (b) the equity investors do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities.  Additionally, a company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses from a VIE’s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and is required to consolidate the VIE in the company’s financial statements.\nAs a result of the evaluation of the reinsurance agreement with Long Point Re IV, the Company concluded that it was a VIE because the conditions described in items (a) and (b) above were present.  However, while Long Point Re IV was determined to be a VIE, the Company concluded that it did not have a variable interest in the entity, as the variability in its results, caused by the reinsurance agreement, is expected to be absorbed entirely by the investors in the catastrophe bonds issued by Long Point Re IV and residual amounts earned by it, if any, are expected to be absorbed by the equity investors (the Company has neither an equity nor a residual interest in Long Point Re IV).\nAccordingly, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of Long Point Re IV and does not consolidate that entity in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  Additionally, because the Company has no intention to pursue any transaction that would result in it acquiring interest in and becoming the primary beneficiary of Long Point Re IV, the consolidation of that entity in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods is unlikely.\nThe Company has not incurred any losses that have resulted or are expected to result in a recovery under the Long Point Re IV agreement since its inception.\n18\nPersonal Insurance Hurricane Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. \n This treaty provides up to $500 million part of $1.00 billion of coverage for a single event, subject to a $2.00 billion retention (i.e., for every dollar of loss between $2.00 billion and $3.00 billion, this treaty provides 50 cents of coverage), for homeowners property losses arising from a hurricane or tropical storm for the period from July 1, 2024 through and including June 30, 2025.  The treaty covers the United States coastal states from Texas to Maine, excluding Florida.\nNortheast Property Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty.  \nThis treaty provides up to $1.00 billion of coverage, subject to a $2.75 billion retention, for losses arising from a single occurrence and allows for one reinstatement. Coverage is provided on an all perils basis, including but not limited to hurricanes, tornadoes, hail storms, earthquakes, winter storms and/or freeze losses (coverage is included for terrorism events in limited circumstances). Coverage for cyber events applies only in limited circumstances, and coverage for communicable disease and nuclear, biological and radiological terrorism attacks is excluded from this treaty. The treaty covers territory from Virginia to Maine for the period from July 1, 2024 through and including June 30, 2025. Losses from a covered event anywhere in North America and waters contiguous thereto may be used to satisfy the retention. Recoveries under the catastrophe bonds (if any) would be first applied to reduce losses subject to this treaty.\nBusiness Insurance Earthquake Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty\n.  This treaty provided up to $293 million part of $325 million of coverage for Middle Market, subject to a $135 million retention (i.e., for every dollar of loss between $135 million and $460 million, this treaty provided 90 cents of coverage) for the period from July 1, 2024 through and including June 30, 2025.  This treaty was cancelled mid-term and replaced with a new Business Insurance treaty that provides up to $775 million part of $1.00 billion of coverage, subject to a $350 million retention (i.e., for every dollar of loss between $350 million and $1.35 billion, this treaty provides 77.5 cents of coverage) for the period from February 1, 2025, through and including January 31, 2026.  The treaty covers losses arising from an earthquake, including other ensuing causes of loss such as fire following and sprinkler leakage, incurred under policies written by domestic Business Insurance (with the exception of Ocean Marine).  The treaty covers the United States and Canada, their territories, possessions and waters contiguous thereto.\nPersonal Insurance Earthquake Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. \n This treaty provides up to $160 million part of $200 million of coverage, subject to a $170 million retention, for losses occurring from an earthquake, including fire following and sprinkler leakage, incurred by Personal Insurance from January 1, 2025 through and including December 31, 2025.  The treaty covers the United States, its territories, possessions and waters contiguous thereto.\nCanadian Property Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty.\n  This treaty provides coverage for 50% of losses in excess of C$100 million (US$69 million at December 31, 2024) up to C$200 million (US$139 million at December 31, 2024) and for 100% of losses in excess of C$200 million (US$139 million at December 31, 2024) up to C$500 million (US$347 million at December 31, 2024), in each case with respect to the accumulation of net property losses arising out of one occurrence on business written by the Company’s Canadian businesses for the period from July 1, 2024 through and including June 30, 2025. The treaty covers all property written by the Company’s Canadian businesses, including, but not limited to, habitational property, commercial property, inland marine, ocean marine and auto physical damages exposures. Coverage for cyber events applies only in limited circumstances, and coverage for communicable disease and nuclear, biological and radiological terrorism attacks is excluded from this treaty.  \nOther International Reinsurance Treaties.\n For other business underwritten in Canada, as well as for business written in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and in the Company’s operations at Lloyd’s, separate reinsurance protections are purchased locally that have lower net retentions more commensurate with the size of the respective local balance sheet.  \nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program.\n  The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program is a Federal program administered by the Department of the Treasury authorized through December 31, 2027 that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism.  For a further description of the program, including the Company’s estimated deductible under the program in 2025, see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and “Item 1A—Risk Factors—High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas and changing climate conditions, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.” \nCLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES\nClaims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management’s estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date. \n19\nThe Company refines its reserve estimates as part of its regular ongoing process that includes reviews of key assumptions, underlying variables and historical loss experience.  The Company reflects adjustments to reserves in the results of operations in the periods in which the estimates are changed. In establishing reserves, the Company takes into account estimated recoveries for reinsurance, salvage and subrogation. The reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the Company.  For additional information on the process of estimating reserves and a discussion of underlying variables and risk factors, see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates.” \nThe process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables (discussed by product line in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) are affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial trends, the tort environment and the legislative landscape, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in the underlying insurance contract (e.g., claims-made versus occurrence), claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of the occurrence date for a claim, and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the insured event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process. \nThe Company derives estimates for unreported claims and development with respect to reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of historical patterns of loss development by accident year for each business unit, product line and type of exposure. Similarly, the Company derives estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses principally from actuarial analyses of historical development patterns and the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each product line and type of exposure. For a description of the Company’s reserving methods for asbestos and environmental claims, see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Asbestos Claims and Litigation,” and “—Environmental Claims and Litigation.” \nCertain of the Company’s claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are discounted to present value.  See note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nReserves on Statutory Accounting Basis\nAt December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (net of reinsurance) prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP reserves) were $93 million higher, $87 million higher and $91 million higher, respectively, than those reported in the Company’s respective annual financial reports filed with insurance regulators, which are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices (statutory reserves).\nThe differences between the amount of reserves reported for GAAP and statutory reporting are primarily due to the differences in accounting for: (i) fee reimbursements associated with large deductible business, (ii) the impact of updated guidance for credit losses applicable to structured settlements and (iii) the accounting for reinsurance.\nFor large deductible business, the Company pays the deductible portion of a casualty insurance claim and then seeks reimbursement from the insured, plus a fee.  The associated reserves for claim adjustment expenses are reported gross of the expected fee income (i.e., the reserves are not net of the expected fees) for GAAP reporting.   For statutory reporting, the associated reserves are reported net of the expected fee income.\nFor GAAP reporting, amounts payable under structured settlements for which the Company did not receive a release of its obligation from the claimant are reported in loss reserves and reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts.  For statutory reporting, structured settlements for which the Company has not obtained a release are disclosed as a contingent liability and not recorded as part of loss reserves.\nReserves for claims and claim adjustment expenses are reported gross of reinsurance recoverables (i.e., without reduction for amounts recoverable for reinsurance) for GAAP reporting.  For statutory reporting, the reserves are reported net of reinsurance recoverables.  Additionally, reinsurance balances resulting from reinsurance placed to cover losses on insured events occurring prior to the inception of a reinsurance contract (retroactive reinsurance) are included in reinsurance recoverables for GAAP reporting.  Statutory accounting practices require retroactive reinsurance balances to be recorded in other liabilities as contra-liabilities rather than in loss reserves.\n20\nAsbestos and Environmental Claims\nAsbestos and environmental claims are segregated from other claims and are handled separately within the Company’s Strategic Resolution Group, a separate unit staffed by dedicated legal, claim, finance and engineering professionals which also has responsibility for enterprise-wide major case activity. For additional information on asbestos and environmental claims, see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Asbestos Claims and Litigation” and “—Environmental Claims and Litigation.”\nINTERCOMPANY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENTS\nMost of the Company’s domestic insurance subsidiaries participate in an intercompany property and casualty reinsurance pooling arrangement. Under such arrangements, the participating subsidiaries share substantially all insurance business they write by reinsuring their combined premiums, losses and expenses to each participating subsidiary in accordance with the quota share participation rate provided in the intercompany agreement. Pooling arrangements allow the participating companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pool’s statutory capital and surplus rather than just on each participating subsidiary’s own statutory capital and surplus.   \nRATINGS\nRatings are an important factor in assessing the Company’s competitive position in the insurance industry. The Company receives ratings from the following major rating agencies: A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and S&P Global Ratings (S&P). Rating agencies typically issue two types of ratings for insurance companies: claims-paying (or financial strength) ratings, which reflect the rating agency’s assessment of an insurer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders, and debt ratings, which reflect the rating agency’s assessment of a company’s prospects for repaying its debts and are considered by lenders in connection with the setting of interest rates and terms for a company’s short- and long-term borrowings. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and they may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency.  Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.  The system and the number of rating categories can vary widely from rating agency to rating agency.  Customers usually focus on claims-paying ratings, while creditors focus on debt ratings. Investors use both to evaluate a company’s overall financial strength. The ratings issued on the Company or its subsidiaries by any of these agencies are announced publicly and are available on the Company’s website and from the agencies. \nA downgrade in one or more of the Company’s claims-paying ratings could negatively impact the Company’s business volumes and competitive position because demand for certain of its products may be reduced, particularly because some customers require that the Company maintain minimum ratings to enter into, maintain or renew business with it.  \nAdditionally, a downgrade in one or more of the Company’s debt ratings could adversely impact the Company’s ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds, including in the syndicated bank loan market, and/or result in higher financing costs.  For example, downgrades in the Company’s debt ratings could result in higher interest expense under the Company’s revolving credit agreement (under which the cost of borrowing could range from the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 85 basis points (including a credit spread adjustment) to SOFR plus 147.5 basis points (including a credit spread adjustment), depending on the Company’s debt ratings), the Company’s commercial paper program, or in the event that the Company were to access the capital markets by issuing debt or similar types of securities.  See note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company’s revolving credit agreement and commercial paper program.  The Company considers the level of increased cash funding requirements in the event of a ratings downgrade as part of the evaluation of the Company’s liquidity requirements.  The Company currently believes that a one- to two-notch downgrade in its debt ratings would not result in a material increase in interest expense under its existing credit agreement and commercial paper programs.  In addition, the Company considers the impact of a ratings downgrade as part of the evaluation of its common share repurchases. \nS&P updated its capital adequacy model in 2023. The updated model resulted in a modest improvement in its assessment of the Company’s capital metrics. As part of its capital management strategy, the Company will continue to make its own assessment of the appropriate level of capital to support the Company’s business operations. For a discussion of the risks to the Company’s claims-paying and financial strength ratings, see the risk factor entitled “A downgrade in our claims-paying and financial strength ratings could adversely impact our business volumes, adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase our borrowing costs” included in “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors.”\n21\nClaims — Paying Ratings\nThe following table summarizes the current claims-paying (or financial strength) ratings for each of the Company’s rated entities as of February 13, 2025, including the position of each rating in the applicable agency’s rating scale.\n \n \nA.M. Best\n \nMoody’s\n \nS&P\n \nFitch\nTravelers Reinsurance Pool (a)(b)\n \nA++\n(1\nst\n of 16)\n \nAa2\n(3\nrd\n of 21)\n \nAA\n(3\nrd\n of 21)\n \nAA (3\nrd\n of 21)\nTravelers C&S Co. of America\n \nA++\n(1\nst\n of 16)\n \nAa2\n(3\nrd\n of 21)\n \nAA\n(3\nrd\n of 21)\n \nAA (3\nrd\n of 21)\nFirst Floridian Auto and Home Ins.

The outlook for all ratings is stable.\n•\nOn June 18, 2024, S&P affirmed all ratings of the Company. The outlook for all ratings is stable.\n•\nOn August 2, 2024, A.M. Best affirmed all ratings of the Company. The outlook for all ratings is stable.\n22\n•\nOn November 25, 2024, Fitch affirmed all ratings of the Company. The outlook for all ratings is stable.\nINVESTMENT OPERATIONS\nThe majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt and taxable U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.  The Company regularly monitors the effective duration of its fixed maturity investments, and the Company’s investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy its insurance and debt obligations.  Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Company’s insurance reserves.  The Company manages the investment duration relative to its liability duration.  In 2024, the estimated effective duration of the Company’s portfolio of fixed maturity and short-term security investments increased, primarily driven by the impact of higher interest rates, as well as the composition of the investment portfolio. In 2024, the estimated effective duration of the Company’s net insurance liabilities decreased, primarily reflecting the impact of the mix of net insurance liabilities and higher interest rates.  At December 31, 2024, the estimated effective duration of the Company’s portfolio of fixed maturity and short-term security investments was greater than the estimated effective duration of the Company’s net insurance liabilities.  The substantial amount by which the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high-quality liquid bonds, contributes to the Company’s ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access its credit facilities.  \nThe Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures.  These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also involve varying degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity. \nSee note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Company’s investment portfolio. \nREGULATION\nU.S. State and Federal Regulation\nThe Company’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact insurance business in all U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands and are subject to regulation in both the various states and jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries are legally domiciled and in which the subsidiaries transact business. The extent of regulation varies, but generally derives from statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory, and administrative authority to a department of insurance or finance in each state and jurisdiction. The regulation, supervision, and administration relate, among other things, to standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, the nature of and limitations on investments, premium rates, restrictions on the type and size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, the licensing of insurers and their agents, approval of policy forms and the regulation of market conduct, including the use of credit and other information in underwriting as well as other underwriting and claims practices.  State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of insurance companies and require the filing of various financial and other reports on a quarterly and annual basis.\nState insurance regulation continues to evolve in response to the changing economic and business environment as well as efforts by regulators internationally to develop a consistent approach to regulation.  While the U.S. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, the Federal Insurance Office (or FIO), which was established within the U.S. Treasury Department as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, has limited authority over the insurance industry.  State insurance regulators, through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), along with the Federal Reserve and the FIO have been active in the efforts by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) to develop international regulatory standards for the insurance industry that, if adopted by the states, would result in changes to the regulation of insurance in the U.S.  In response to these international efforts, the state insurance regulators, through the NAIC, undertook several initiatives to consider and develop changes to the U.S. regulatory framework, including the development of regulatory tools to evaluate risks and establish capital standards on a groupwide basis in addition to the current requirements imposed on a legal-entity basis.\nThese changes are evidenced by the incorporation of supervisory colleges into the U.S. regulatory framework to facilitate oversight of insurers at a group level that have been designated an internationally active insurance group by the group’s lead state regulator.  A supervisory college is a forum of the regulators having jurisdictional authority over a holding company’s various insurance subsidiaries, including foreign insurance subsidiaries, convened to meet with the insurer’s executive \n23\nmanagement to evaluate the insurer’s business strategies, approach to enterprise risk management and corporate governance from both a groupwide and legal-entity perspective.\nWhile insurance in the United States is regulated on a legal-entity basis, the NAIC has adopted changes to its Model Holding Company Act that some states, including the State of Connecticut, have enacted to allow the insurance commissioner to be designated as the groupwide supervisor (i.e., lead state commissioner) for the insurance holding company system based upon certain criteria, including the jurisdiction of domicile of the insurance subsidiaries holding the majority of the insurance group’s premiums, assets, or liabilities.  Based upon these criteria, the State of Connecticut Insurance Department is designated as the Company’s lead regulator and coordinates supervisory colleges for the Company.  Additionally, in response to international efforts to establish capital standards on a groupwide basis, the NAIC adopted changes to its Model Holding Company Act to require certain insurance groups to file a Group Capital Calculation to allow the groupwide supervisor (lead state) to evaluate the risks and available capital on a groupwide basis in addition to the risk-based capital requirements currently imposed on a legal-entity basis.  The State of Connecticut amended its holding company act to incorporate the changes made to the NAIC Model Holding Company Act and required insurers, including the Company, to file a Group Capital Calculation beginning in 2023.  These changes have not impacted the amount of capital the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are required to have.\nInsurance Regulation Concerning Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries.\n  The Company’s principal domestic insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the State of Connecticut. The Connecticut insurance holding company laws require notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend from an insurance subsidiary that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurance subsidiary’s statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31\nst\n, or the insurance subsidiary’s net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31\nst\n, in each case determined in accordance with the statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of Connecticut Insurance Department. This declaration or payment is further limited by the amount of adjusted unassigned surplus held by the insurance subsidiaries, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.\nThe insurance holding company laws of states in which the Company’s other domestic insurance subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends.  These insurance subsidiaries, as well as the insurance subsidiaries domiciled in Connecticut, may also be subject to similar dividends limitations imposed by states in which those subsidiaries are considered commercially domiciled as a result of the amount of business written in those states.\nRate and Rule Approvals.  \nTRV’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to each state’s laws and regulations regarding rate and rule approvals.  The applicable laws and regulations generally establish standards to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or used to engage in unfair price competition.  An insurer’s ability to adjust rates and the relative timing of the process are dependent upon each state’s requirements.  Many states have enacted variations of competitive ratemaking laws, which allow insurers to set certain premium rates for certain classes of insurance without having to obtain the prior approval of the state insurance department.\nRequirements for Exiting Geographic Markets and/or Canceling or Nonrenewing Policies.  \nMany states have laws and regulations which may impact the timing and/or the ability of an insurer to either discontinue or substantially reduce its writings in that state.  These laws and regulations typically require prior notice and in some instances insurance department approval prior to discontinuing a line of business or withdrawing from that state.  In addition, all states impose limitations on cancellations or non-renewals of certain policies, including in particular, limitations on the reasons for cancellations and on the timing of non-renewals.\nRegulatory and Legislative Responses to Catastrophes.  \nStates from time to time have passed legislation, and regulators have taken action, that have the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe risk, such as legislation restricting insurers from reducing exposures or withdrawing from catastrophe-prone areas or mandating that insurers participate in residual markets involving catastrophe-prone areas. Participation in residual market mechanisms has resulted in, and may in the future result in, significant losses or assessments to insurers, including the Company, and, in certain states, those losses or assessments may not be commensurate with the Company’s direct catastrophe risk exposure in those states. If the Company’s competitors leave states that have residual market mechanisms, the remaining insurers, including the Company, may be subject to significant increases in losses or assessments following a catastrophe. In addition, following catastrophes, there have been, and may in the future be, legislative and administrative initiatives and court decisions that seek to expand insurance coverage for catastrophe claims beyond the original intent of the policies, seek to prevent the application of deductibles included in the policies, or seek to limit the exercise of certain rights available to insurers under the policies.  Also, the Company’s ability to adjust policy language or terms, including deductible levels, or to increase pricing to the extent necessary to offset rising claim costs related to catastrophes requires approval of insurance regulatory authorities in certain states. The Company’s ability or its willingness to manage its catastrophe exposure by raising prices, modifying policy terms, or reducing exposure to certain \n24\ngeographies may be limited due to considerations of public policy, an evolving political environment, and/or changes in general economic conditions.  Furthermore, the reduction or elimination of the National Flood Insurance Program could result in an increase in the Company’s exposure to flood risk if insurers become required to cover flood risk under certain types of policies.\nAssessments for Guaranty Funds and Second-Injury Funds and Other Mandatory Assigned Risk and Reinsurance Arrangements. \nAs a condition of their authority to transact insurance in virtually all states, property and casualty insurers, including the Company’s domestic insurance subsidiaries, are required to be a member of each state’s guaranty association and to bear a portion of the losses covered by the guaranty association (subject to a statutory maximum covered loss amount which varies by state) suffered by claimants of insurers that become insolvent.  Additionally, many states also have laws that establish second-injury funds that impose assessments on insurers writing workers’ compensation business, including the Company, to provide compensation to injured employees for the aggravation of a prior injury or disability. \nThe Company’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are also required to participate in various involuntary assigned risk pools, principally involving workers’ compensation, automobile insurance, property damage due to wind (windpools) in states prone to property damage from hurricanes and in Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plans, as well as automobile assigned risk plans the results of which are not pooled with other carriers, which provide various insurance coverages to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage in the voluntary market.\nOther assessments include charges mandated by statute or regulatory authority that are related directly or indirectly to underwriting activities.  Examples of such mechanisms include, but are not limited to, the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, National Workers’ Compensation Reinsurance Pool, various workers’ compensation related funds (e.g., the Florida Special Disability Trust), North Carolina Beach Plan, Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association.  Amounts payable or paid as a result of arrangements that are in substance reinsurance, including certain involuntary pools where insurers are required to assume premiums and losses from those pools, are accounted for as reinsurance (e.g., the National Workers’ Compensation Reinsurance Pool, North Carolina Beach Plan).  Amounts related to assessments from arrangements that are not reinsurance are reported as part of “General and Administrative Expenses,” such as the Florida Special Disability Trust.  For additional information concerning assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds as well as other mandatory assigned risk and reinsurance agreements including state-funding mechanisms, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors.”\nInsurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS). \nThe NAIC developed the IRIS to help state regulators identify companies that may require regulatory attention. Financial examiners review annual financial statements and the results of key financial ratios based on year-end data with the goal of identifying insurers that appear to require immediate regulatory attention.  Each ratio has an established “usual range” of results. A ratio result falling outside the usual range, however, is not necessarily considered adverse; rather, unusual values are used as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. Generally, an insurance company may become subject to regulatory scrutiny or, depending on the company’s financial condition, regulatory action if certain of its key IRIS ratios fall outside the usual ranges and the insurer’s financial condition is trending downward.\nBased on preliminary 2024 IRIS ratios calculated by the Company for its lead domestic insurance subsidiaries, in both 2024 and 2023, The Travelers Indemnity Company had results outside the normal range for one IRIS ratio due to the size of its investments in certain non-fixed maturity securities, while Travelers Casualty and Surety Company had results outside the normal range for one IRIS ratio due to the amount of dividends received from its subsidiaries. \nManagement does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of the 2024 IRIS ratio results for the lead insurance subsidiaries or their insurance subsidiaries.  In all instances in prior years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required.\nRisk-Based Capital (RBC) Requirements.\n The NAIC maintains an RBC requirement which sets forth minimum capital standards for most U.S.-based property and casualty insurance companies that is intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations.  The Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to these NAIC RBC requirements based on laws that have been adopted by individual states.  These requirements subject insurers having policyholders’ surplus less than that required by the RBC calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. \nThe amount of policyholders’ surplus held by each of the Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2024 and 2023 exceeded the level at which the subsidiaries would be subject to RBC regulatory action on a legal entity basis or the need for additional analysis when evaluated on a combined basis.\n25\nThe RBC formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital above the RBC requirement. Therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies.\nGroup Capital Calculation (GCC).  \nWhile there is currently no group regulatory capital requirement in place for insurers in the United States, certain states, including the State of Connecticut, adopted the NAIC Group Capital Calculation (GCC) to provide insurance regulators with additional analytical information on a combined basis that is used by the lead state in assessing group risks and groupwide capital adequacy to complement the RBC requirements imposed on a legal-entity basis and the holding company analysis performed by the lead state. The GCC utilizes an aggregation of the available capital/financial resources and the required regulatory capital of a group’s subsidiaries (known as an Aggregation Method), using the NAIC RBC requirements to identify available and required capital for the group’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries and the local jurisdictional capital requirements for insurance subsidiaries outside of the U.S.  The GCC differs from the RBC in that it does not produce a ratio that is subject to a minimum value or result in an identified action level.  Instead, the GCC is used in conjunction with other regulatory tools to assist in the lead regulator’s group-wide supervision and evaluation of the adequacy of a group’s capital position.\nAs part of the international efforts to develop a groupwide capital standard, the IAIS completed a comparability analysis in November 2024 of the Aggregation Method used in the U.S. (i.e., the GCC as discussed above) and recognized the U.S. method as producing results comparable to the group capital standard (Insurance Capital Standard, or ICS) developed by the IAIS.\nInvestment Regulation\n.  Insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality, and concentration of investments. In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate, and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications, depending on the type of investment.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company was in compliance with these laws and regulations.\nFederal Regulation.  \nAs mentioned above, the Dodd-Frank Act established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  The FIO has limited regulatory authority and is empowered to gather data and information regarding the insurance industry and insurers, but it has in the past recommended an expanded federal role in some circumstances. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the Federal Reserve supervisory authority over a number of non-bank financial services holding companies, including holding companies with insurance company subsidiaries, if they are designated by a two-thirds vote of a Financial Stability Oversight Council (the FSOC) as “systemically important financial institutions” (SIFI) or own a bank or thrift. The Company, based upon the FSOC’s rules and interpretive guidance, has not been designated as a SIFI and is not subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. Nonetheless, it is possible that FSOC may change its rules, interpretations, or application thereof in the future and conclude that the Company is a SIFI. If the Company were designated as a SIFI, the Federal Reserve’s supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial regulation and could impact requirements regarding the Company’s capital, liquidity and leverage as well as its business and investment conduct.  The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes assessments to pay for the resolution of SIFIs that have become insolvent. The Company (as a financial company with more than $50 billion in assets) could be assessed, and although any such assessment is required to be risk weighted (i.e., riskier firms pay more), such costs could be material and are not currently estimable.  As a result of the foregoing, the Dodd-Frank Act, including any changes thereto or additional related regulations, or other additional federal regulation that is adopted in the future, could impose additional burdens on the Company, including impacting the ways in which the Company conducts its business, increasing compliance costs and duplicating state regulation, and could result in a competitive disadvantage, particularly relative to other competitors that may not be subject to the same level of regulation.\nInternational Regulation\nThe Company’s insurance subsidiaries based in Canada, and the Canadian branch of one of the Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, are regulated for solvency and risk management purposes by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) under the provisions of the Insurance Companies Act (Canada).  These Canadian subsidiaries and the Canadian branch are also subject to Canadian provincial and territorial insurance legislation and regulation, primarily governing market conduct, including pricing, underwriting, coverage, and claim conduct, in varying degrees by province/territory and by product line.\nThe Company’s insurance subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom (U.K.) are regulated by two regulatory bodies, The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  One of the Company’s U.K. insurance subsidiaries is also authorized in the U.S. as a surplus lines insurer subject to U.S. state regulation applicable to such insurers.\nThe Company’s managing agency (Travelers Syndicate Management Limited, or TSML) of its Lloyd’s syndicate (Syndicate 5000 at Lloyd’s) is also regulated by the PRA and the FCA, which have delegated certain regulatory responsibilities to the \n26\nCouncil of Lloyd’s.  Travelers Syndicate 5000 is able to write, or reinsure, business in respect of over 200 countries and territories throughout the world by virtue of Lloyd’s international licenses.  In each such jurisdiction, the policies written by TSML, as part of Lloyd’s, are subject to the laws and insurance regulations of that jurisdiction.  Since January 1, 2019, the Company has used a Lloyd’s insurance subsidiary in Brussels, Belgium (Lloyd’s Brussels) to cover its Lloyd’s customers’ risks in the EU.  Lloyd’s Brussels is regulated by the National Bank of Belgium.\nTravelers is conducting its European insurance operations through an insurance subsidiary that is incorporated in the Republic of Ireland and authorized and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. Certain operations are conducted in the U.K. through a U.K. branch of the Irish subsidiary, which is supervised by the PRA and FCA as well as the Central Bank of Ireland.\nThe Company’s operations in the Republic of Ireland are also subject to regulation by the European Union (EU).  Generally, EU requirements are adopted by the EU and then implemented by enabling legislation in the member countries.  Significant areas of oversight and influence by the EU include capital and solvency requirements (Solvency II), competition law and antitrust regulation, intermediary and distribution regulation, gender discrimination, sustainability disclosures, including climate change disclosure (due to the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, or CSRD, and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, or CSDDD), artificial intelligence and data security and privacy.  Under Solvency II, it is possible that the U.S. parent of a European Union subsidiary could be subject to certain Solvency II requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary’s capital position is dependent on the parent company and the U.S. parent is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to Solvency II.\n \nCurrently, as a result of the Covered Agreements described below, the state regulatory system governing U.S. insurers is deemed “equivalent” for purposes of Solvency II.\n \n \nEach of the Company’s foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital significantly above their respective regulatory requirements at December 31, 2024.\nRegulators in countries where the Company has operations are working with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) (and with the NAIC, the Federal Reserve and FIO in the U.S.) to consider changes to insurance company supervision, including group supervision and group capital requirements as described above.\nThe IAIS has developed a framework (i.e., the Global Monitoring Exercise, or GME) to assess the potential systemic risk in the global insurance sector for identifying “global systemically important insurers” (G-SIIs) and high-level policy measures that will apply to the G-SIIs.  The methodology and measures were endorsed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) which was created by the Group of Twenty (or G-20); however, identification of G-SIIs was suspended at the beginning of 2020.  In December 2022, the FSB, in consultation with the IAIS, decided to discontinue the annual identification of G-SIIs.  Going forward the FSB will utilize a newly developed framework to inform its considerations of systemic risk in the insurance sector.  The Company has not previously been designated as a G-SII by the FSB; however, it is possible that the designation of G-SIIs could be reinstituted, the methodologies or framework could be amended or interpreted differently in the future and the Company could be named as a G-SII.\nThe IAIS completed its Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (known as ComFrame). ComFrame is intended to apply heightened regulatory requirements similar to those being developed for G-SIIs to internationally active insurance groups (or “IAIGs”), including group supervision, group capital requirements, and resolution planning, i.e., a written plan developed by a financial group detailing how it would be wound down in the event of an insolvency.  While the Company would not be considered an IAIG under the current criteria in ComFrame, it is possible that the criteria could be changed.  If the Company is designated as an IAIG or the NAIC and individual states adopt ComFrame or similar provisions for large insurers, the Company could be subject to increased supervision and higher capital standards.\nCovered Agreements\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative have signed covered agreements (the Covered Agreements) regarding prudential (solvency) insurance and reinsurance measures with both the EU and the U.K.  The Covered Agreements include three areas of prudential insurance supervision: reinsurance contracts, group supervision, and the exchange of information between U.S. and U.K. regulators and between U.S. and EU regulators on insurers and reinsurers that operate in the U.S., U.K., and EU markets.  The Covered Agreement with the EU went into effect in April 2018, while the Covered Agreement with the U.K. took full effect upon the U.K.’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020. The Covered Agreements are intended to promote cooperation between U.S. insurance regulators and EU and U.K. insurance regulators and to limit the ability of the EU and the U.K. to apply solvency and group capital requirements to the worldwide operations of any U.S. insurer operating in the EU or the U.K.  It is possible that individual members of the EU could differ in how they adopt or apply the terms of the Covered Agreement, resulting in greater regulation and higher capital standards as well as inconsistent regulatory requirements among the jurisdictions in which the Company does business.  While it is not yet known how or if \n27\nthese actions will impact the Company, such regulation could result in increased costs of compliance, increased disclosure, and less flexibility in capital management, and could adversely impact the Company’s results of operations and limit its growth.  \nThe Covered Agreements eliminate the collateral and local presence requirements for EU and U.K. reinsurers operating in the U.S., and for U.S. reinsurers operating in the EU and U.K., as a condition for credit for reinsurance in regulatory reporting and capital requirements. The prospective elimination of the collateral requirements is conditioned on the reinsurer meeting capital and solvency standards and maintaining a record of prompt payments to ceding insurers. While the collateral requirement is removed for reinsurers meeting these standards, insurers and reinsurers are not prohibited from negotiating and putting into place collateral as part of reinsurance agreements. The Covered Agreements include a five-year transition period to full compliance in the impacted jurisdictions.\nInsurance Holding Company Statutes\nAs a holding company, TRV is not regulated as an insurance company. However, since TRV owns capital stock in insurance subsidiaries, it is subject to state insurance holding company statutes, as well as certain other laws, of each of its insurance subsidiaries’ states of domicile. All holding company statutes, as well as other laws, require disclosure and, in some instances, prior approval of certain transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate. The holding company statutes and other laws also require, among other things, prior approval for acquiring control of a domestic insurer and the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions.\nInsurance Regulations Concerning Change of Control.\n  Many state insurance regulatory laws contain provisions that require prior approval by state agencies of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled, or, in some cases, having substantial business in a state such that the insurance company is deemed to be commercially domiciled in that state.\nThe laws of many states also contain provisions requiring pre-notification to state agencies prior to any change in control of a non-domestic insurance company admitted to transact business in that state. While these pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, they do authorize issuance of cease-and-desist orders with respect to the non-domestic insurer if it is determined that some conditions, such as undue market concentration, would result from the acquisition.\nAny transactions that would constitute a change in control of any of TRV’s insurance subsidiaries would generally require prior approval by the insurance departments of the states in which the insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or commercially domiciled.  Pre-acquisition notification may also be required in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and in which such insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business.\nAs described above, one of TRV’s insurance subsidiaries and its operations at Lloyd’s are domiciled in the U.K. and one of its insurance subsidiaries is domiciled in the Republic of Ireland.  Insurers in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland are subject to change of control restrictions, including approval of the PRA and FCA and of the Central Bank of Ireland, respectively.  TRV’s insurance subsidiaries domiciled in, or authorized to conduct insurance business in, Canada are also subject to regulatory change of control restrictions, including approval of OSFI.  TRV’s Brazilian joint venture is subject to regulatory change of control and other share transfer restrictions, including approval of the Superintendência de Seguros Privados (SUSEP).\nThese requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions affecting the control of or the ownership of common stock, including transactions that could be advantageous to TRV’s shareholders.\nInsurance Intermediaries\nThe Company has domestic and international subsidiaries which act as insurance intermediaries, i.e., agents, brokers, and managing general underwriters.  These entities are regulated by state, provincial, and international regulatory and self-regulatory bodies focused on market conduct and other matters.\nRegulatory Developments\nThe state insurance regulatory framework has been under continuing scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators continually re-examine existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to holding company statutes, regulations, interpretations of existing laws, and the development of new laws and regulations.\nAs part of these changes, insurance holding company regulations were amended to require insurers who are part of a holding company system to file an enterprise risk report to provide the lead insurance regulator with a summary of the company’s \n28\nEnterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, including the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose risk to the insurance entities within the holding company system. Insurers having premium volume above certain thresholds, including the Company, are also required to perform at least annually a self-assessment of their current and future risks, including their likely future solvency position (known as an own risk and solvency assessment, or ORSA) and file a confidential report with the insurer’s lead insurance regulator. The requirement for an insurer to conduct an ORSA is intended to foster an effective level of ERM for all insurers within a holding company system and to provide a group-wide perspective on risks and capital as a supplement to the legal entity view. ORSA is now required in the United States, the U.K., Europe and Canada and is in various stages of implementation in other jurisdictions, and included in the IAIS standards. It is possible that, as a result of ORSA and the manner in which it may be used by insurance regulators, the Company’s states of domicile or other regulatory bodies may require changes in its ERM process (e.g., prescribe the use of specific models or the application of certain assumptions or scenarios in the Company’s models) that have the effect of limiting the Company’s ability to write certain risks, limit its risk appetite, or reduce its capital management flexibility. See “Item 1—Business—Enterprise Risk Management” for further discussion of the Company’s ERM.\nFor additional information concerning regulations applicable to the Company, including cyber regulations, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Our businesses are heavily regulated by the states and countries in which we conduct business, including licensing, market conduct and financial supervision, and changes in regulation, including changes in tax regulation, may reduce our profitability and limit our growth” and “Item 1A—Risk Factors—If we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security (including as a result of cyber attacks), outsourcing relationships or cloud-based technology, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted.”\nENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) activities involve both the identification and assessment of a broad range of risks and the execution of coordinated strategies to effectively manage these risks.  Since certain risks can be correlated with other risks, an event or a series of events can impact multiple areas of the Company simultaneously and have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.  This requires an entity-wide view of risk and an understanding of the potential impact on all aspects of the Company’s operations.  It also requires the Company to manage its risk-taking to be within its risk appetite in a prudent and balanced effort to create and preserve value for all of the Company’s stakeholders.  ERM also includes an evaluation of the Company’s risk capital needs, which takes into account regulatory requirements, financial strength and credit rating considerations, in addition to economic and other factors.  ERM at the Company is an integral part of its business operations.  All risk owners across all functions, all corporate leaders and the Board of Directors are engaged in ERM.  ERM involves risk-based analytics, as well as reporting and feedback throughout the enterprise in support of the Company’s long-term financial strategies and objectives.  \nThe Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events.  In addition to catastrophe modeling and analysis, the Company also models and analyzes its exposure to other extreme events.  The Company also utilizes proprietary and third-party modeling processes to evaluate capital adequacy.  These analytical techniques are an integral component of the Company’s ERM process and further support the Company’s long-term financial strategies and objectives.  \nIn addition to the day-to-day ERM activities within the Company’s operations, key internal risk management functions include, among others, the Management and Operating Committees (comprised of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the other most senior members of management); the Enterprise, Segment and Function (including Catastrophe, Cyber, etc.) Risk Committees of management; the Executive Crisis Management Team; the Sustainability Committee; and the Credit Committee.  A senior executive team comprised of the Chief Risk Officer and the Enterprise Chief Underwriting Officer oversees the ERM process.  The mission of this team is to facilitate risk assessment and to collaborate in implementing effective risk management strategies throughout the Company.  Another strategic ERM objective of this team includes working across the Company to enhance effective and realistic risk modeling capabilities as part of the Company’s overall effort to understand and manage its portfolio of risks to be within its risk appetite.  Board oversight of ERM is provided by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, which reviews the strategies, processes and controls pertaining to the Company’s insurance operations and oversees the implementation, execution and performance of the Company’s ERM program.  The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors meets with senior management at least four times a year to discuss ERM activities and provides a report to the full Board of Directors after each such meeting.   \nThe Company’s ERM efforts build upon the foundation of an effective internal control environment.  ERM expands the internal control objectives of effective and efficient operations, reliable financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, to foster, lead and support an integrated, risk-based culture within the Company that focuses on value creation and preservation.  However, the Company can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that these objectives will be met.  \n29\nFurther, the design of any risk management or control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs.  As a result, the possibility of material financial loss remains in spite of the Company’s significant and comprehensive ERM efforts.  An investor should carefully consider the risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report, including the discussions included in “Item 1A—Risk Factors,” “Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” and “Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nOTHER INFORMATION\nSeasonality\nA discussion of the extent to which the Company’s business may be seasonal can be found under “Outlook” within “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.\nHuman Capital Management\n \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 34,000 employees, 90% of whom are located in the United States.  The following table shows the geographic distribution of the Company’s employees as of December 31, 2024:\nLocation\n% of Total\nDomestic:\n \nConnecticut\n22.1 \n%\nNew York\n6.7 \nMinnesota\n6.7 \nTexas\n6.6 \nCalifornia\n5.2 \nFlorida\n4.0 \nMassachusetts\n3.6 \nGeorgia\n3.5 \nIllinois\n3.0 \nAll other domestic \n(1)\n28.6 \nTotal Domestic\n90.0 \nInternational:\nCanada\n5.3 \nUnited Kingdom\n4.5 \nAll other international\n0.2 \nTotal International\n10.0 \nConsolidated total \n100.0 \n%\n___________________________________________\n(1)\nNo other single state accounted for 3.0% or more of the Company’s employees as of December 31, 2024.\nThe average employee tenure at the Company is more than 11 years, and 20 years for the Company’s approximately 750 most senior leaders. The Company’s average global voluntary turnover rate over the past three years was approximately 9%.  The Company believes that these employee tenure and voluntary turnover rates are due, in part, to the resources and support the Company provides to employees throughout their careers, as discussed below. \nMaintaining an Ethical Culture\nThe Company’s culture of honesty, integrity and accountability is critical to its long-term success. To support this culture, the Company promotes ethics and compliance awareness across its operations. On an annual basis, all employees of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries are required to complete the Company’s ethics training and certify that they have reviewed, understand and agree to comply with the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other applicable Company policies. \n30\nThe Company provides employees with multiple channels to raise concerns, including the Human Resources, Employee Relations and Compliance functions, as well as the Travelers Ethics Helpline. The Company’s independently administered Ethics Helpline is available to employees and others 24 hours a day, seven days a week to report issues or seek guidance confidentially and anonymously. Trained professionals investigate each concern and, where appropriate, escalate it internally. In addition, the Company maintains a formal Whistleblowing and Non-Retaliation Policy that prohibits retaliation against, or discipline of, an employee who raises concerns in good faith.\nEmployee Engagement\nThe Company strives to deliver an employee experience that engages its workforce and strengthens the organization. The Company maintains an Employee Experience function that is responsible for, among other things, an employee experience program that is designed to help drive superior business performance. This function helps the Company create and enhance programs designed to improve employee engagement, reduce attrition and support the retention, growth and satisfaction of the Company’s employees.\nThe Company uses various methods to evaluate the employee experience and the success of its employee engagement efforts, as well as to inform the strategies the Company uses to enhance those efforts. In addition, the Company’s Chief Human Resources Officer meets regularly with the Chief Executive Officer and other senior leaders to discuss employee engagement strategies and the Company’s progress.  \nBased on the Company’s employee tenure and voluntary turnover rates, as discussed above, as well as other means the Company uses to evaluate the employee experience and the success of its engagement efforts, the Company believes that its engagement efforts are effective.  \nLearning and Development\nThe Company offers various learning and development opportunities to provide its employees with the skills and capabilities they need to be successful. The Company’s enterprise-wide leadership framework outlines the skills and behaviors expected of our leaders. It supports the sustainability of the culture established at Travelers and serves as the underpinning for our leadership training. The Company also offers additional foundational workshops centered on leadership: Coaching for Performance Excellence and Leading World Class Teams. \nIn addition, the Company offers career mentorship and development programs for both entry-level and experienced professionals. For example, the Company’s Development Programs provide employees with an opportunity to progress through a steady career path in a specific discipline such as Actuarial, Business Insights & Analytics, Data Science, Finance, Human Resources, Engineering (Technology), Operations, Underwriting, Investments or Product Management. Participants complete assignments and rotations designed to help them build upon their strategic thinking skills and business acumen, provide the foundational knowledge and technical skills necessary for success and include on-the-job training, classroom instruction, self-study materials and independent work in an assigned business area. These programs have been a part of the Company’s talent strategy for many years. \nDiversity and Inclusion\nThe Company believes that its diversity and inclusion efforts are important to its success.  The Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer leads the Company’s diversity and inclusion efforts.  The Company also has a Diversity Council that is chaired by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and is composed of the most senior members of the Company’s leadership team. \nThe Company also has 10 Diversity Networks – voluntary groups led by employees, dedicated to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment. The networks, which are open to all employees, help foster the retention, development and success of the Company’s employees through networking, mentorship and community volunteer opportunities. In addition, these groups are a resource for the Company’s business leaders, providing them with important insights and perspectives.  \nWith respect to the Company’s talent pipeline, the Company has established deliberate recruiting, retention and development practices that are tailored to deepen talent pools and broaden advancement opportunities for all employees. These practices include matching upcoming leaders with mentors within the organization and offering workshops to advance their careers within the Company.\n31\nPerformance and Succession\nThe Company’s performance management strategy is designed to develop the Company’s talent and equip employees with the skills and resources necessary to ensure the Company’s continued success. To that end, managers assist with setting and monitoring goals, planning, development and discussing opportunities for improvement throughout the year.  \nThe Company also conducts a comprehensive annual talent review, which includes succession planning, to identify and prepare talented employees for future leadership positions. Each line of business identifies talented employees and succession candidates for targeted development and advancement opportunities. This talent review process culminates with the Chief Executive Officer and those reporting directly to him meeting to review succession plans for key positions.  In addition, the Chief Executive Officer regularly meets with the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and the full Board of Directors to discuss succession-related matters.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company’s compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain high performing employees and to help employees be healthy and productive in all aspects of their lives.\nPaying employees equitably is the foundation of the Company’s performance-based culture. The Company has comprehensive processes and controls in place and reviews its compensation practices annually with independent, outside experts, in each case to help ensure equitable pay across the Company. Based in part on these measures, the Company believes that it pays its employees equitably, regardless of gender, race or any other protected classification.\nThe Company’s minimum hourly wage in the United States is $18. As calculated and reported in the Company’s most recent Proxy Statement filed in April 2024, excluding the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, (i) the median of the annual total compensation of all the Company’s employees was approximately $117,500, and (ii) the median of the annual total compensation of the Company’s full-time U.S. employees who worked for the Company for the entire year, who comprised approximately 90% of its U.S. workforce, was approximately $128,000.\nThe Company takes a holistic approach with respect to the physical, mental and financial well-being of its employees. The Company offers comprehensive, flexible benefit options for its employees.  In the United States, these include, among others:\nHealth and Wellness\n•\nMedical, dental, vision and prescription drug coverage;\n•\nHealth savings and flexible spending accounts;\n•\nThe \nmy\nWellness platform, a mobile-friendly, easy-to-use application, which allows employees to track activity levels, improve sleep, take self-guided courses and much more; \n•\nRound-the-clock access to the Company’s employee assistance program, which provides employees access to professional counseling services, life coaching and support resources;\n•\nIncluded Health, a free service for employees and dependents enrolled in the Company’s medical plan that matches members to top-ranked doctors, provides expert second opinions and assists in navigating the health care system; and\n•\nCaregiving Support from Wellthy, a benefit that helps employees navigate the challenges of caring for children, aging family members or loved ones who are chronically ill.\nSavings and Retirement\n•\nA 401(k) Savings Plan, through which the Company matches employee contributions dollar-for-dollar up to 5% of eligible pay, with a maximum annual Company match of $7,500; \n•\nThe Paying It Forward Savings Program, through which the Company supports employees with student loans by making an annual contribution in the employee’s 401(k) account equal to the annual student loan payments. The combined maximum of the 401(k) match and the Paying It Forward savings contribution is 5% of eligible pay, up to a maximum of $7,500;\n•\nA Pension Plan that provides annual pay credits from 2% to 6% of eligible pay based on age and years of service, plus quarterly interest credits; \n•\nFinancial education program, free one on one guidance sessions, on-demand financial webinars and workshops; and \n•\nInvestment advisory service that provides day-to-day management of employees 401(k) account.\n32\nOther \n•\nLife insurance; \n•\nShort- and long-term disability coverages; \n•\nPaid time-off, starting at 20 days per year, up to a maximum of 30 days per year based on years of service, plus the ability to purchase up to six additional days per year;\n•\nDesignated Company holidays plus floating holiday(s);\n•\nPaid parental and adoption leave; \n•\nChildcare discounts;\n•\nA Legal Services Plan;\n•\nAn Educational Assistance Program; \n•\nA corporate discount program; and \n•\nPaid time off for volunteering. \nBoard Oversight of Human Capital Management\nThe Company’s Board of Directors takes an active role in overseeing the Company’s human capital management strategy, including its diversity and inclusion efforts. The Chief Human Resources Officer and other senior executives present to the Board regularly on human capital management matters, including the progress the Company has made over time. Additionally, pursuant to its charter, the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board meets regularly with senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Human Resources Officer, to review and discuss the Company’s strategies to encourage diversity and inclusion within the Company. Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee of the Board, which is advised by an independent compensation consultant, reviews and approves the Company’s general compensation philosophy and objectives. In addition, the Compensation Committee meets with senior management on a regular basis to discuss the Company’s practices designed to help ensure equitable pay across the organization. \nTaxation\nFor a discussion of tax matters affecting the Company and its operations, see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company relies on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect its intellectual property.  With respect to trademarks specifically, the Company has registrations in many countries, including the United States, for its material trademarks, including the “Travelers” name and the Company’s iconic umbrella logo. The Company has the right to retain its material trademark rights in perpetuity, so long as it satisfies the use and registration requirements of all applicable countries.  The Company regards its trademarks as highly valuable assets in marketing its products and services and vigorously seeks to protect its trademarks against infringement.  See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Intellectual property is important to our business, and we may be unable to protect and enforce our own intellectual property or we may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property of others.” \nCompany Website, Social Media and Availability of SEC Filings\nThe Company’s internet website is \ntravelers.com\n.

An independent agent represents multiple insurance companies and searches the market for the best product for its client.\nAnnuity\nA contract that pays a periodic benefit over the remaining life of a person (the annuitant), the lives of two or more persons or for a specified period of time.\nAssigned risk pools\nReinsurance pools which cover risks for those unable to purchase insurance in the voluntary market. Possible reasons for this inability include the risk being too great or the profit being too small under the required insurance rate structure. The costs of the risks associated with these pools are charged back to insurance carriers in proportion to their direct writings.\nAssumed reinsurance\nInsurance risks acquired from a ceding company.\nBook value per share\nTotal common shareholders’ equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding.\nBroker\nOne who negotiates contracts of insurance or reinsurance on behalf of an insured party, receiving a commission from the insurer or reinsurer for placement and other services rendered.\nCapacity\nThe percentage of statutory capital and surplus, or the dollar amount of exposure, that an insurer or reinsurer is willing or able to place at risk. Capacity may apply to a single risk, a program, a line of business or an entire book of business. Capacity may be constrained by legal restrictions, corporate restrictions or indirect restrictions.\nCaptive\nA closely-held insurance company whose primary purpose is to provide insurance coverage to the company’s owners or their affiliates.\nCase reserves\nClaim department estimates of anticipated future payments to be made on each specific individual reported claim.\nCasualty insurance\nInsurance which is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e., not the insured, and the legal liability imposed on the insured resulting therefrom. It includes, but is not limited to, employers’ liability, workers’ compensation, public liability, automobile liability, personal liability and aviation liability insurance. It excludes certain types of losses that by law or custom are considered as being exclusively within the scope of other types of insurance, such as fire or marine.\n34\nCatastrophe\nA severe loss event designated, or reasonably expected by the Company to be designated, a catastrophe by one or more industry recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada.  Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other destructive acts, including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions and destruction of infrastructure.  Each catastrophe has unique characteristics and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount.  Their effects are included in net and core income and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence.  A catastrophe may also result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools and associations. The Company’s threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is reached and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company.  Additionally, an aggregate threshold is applied for International business across all reportable segments. For 2024, the threshold ranged from approximately $20 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes. \nCatastrophe loss\nLoss and directly identified loss adjustment expenses from catastrophes, as well as related reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools. \nCatastrophe reinsurance\nA form of excess-of-loss reinsurance which, subject to a specified limit, indemnifies the ceding company for the amount of loss in excess of a specified retention with respect to an accumulation of losses and related reinsurance reinstatement premiums resulting from a catastrophic event. The actual reinsurance document is called a “catastrophe cover.” These reinsurance contracts are typically designed to cover property insurance losses but can be written to cover casualty insurance losses such as from workers’ compensation policies.\nCede; ceding company\nWhen an insurer reinsures its liability with another insurer or a “cession,” it “cedes” business and is referred to as the “ceding company.”\nCeded reinsurance\nInsurance risks transferred to another company as reinsurance. See “Reinsurance.”\nClaim\nRequest by an insured for indemnification by an insurance company for loss incurred from an insured peril.\nClaim adjustment expenses\nSee “Loss adjustment expenses (LAE).”\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses\nSee “Loss” and “Loss adjustment expenses (LAE).”\nClaims and claim adjustment expense reserves\nSee “Loss reserves.”\nCohort\nA group of items or individuals that share a particular statistical or demographic characteristic. For example, all claims for a given product in a given market for a given accident year would represent a cohort of claims.\n35\nCombined ratio\nFor Statutory Accounting Practices (SAP), the combined ratio is the sum of the SAP loss and LAE ratio and the SAP underwriting expense ratio as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The combined ratio as used in this report is the equivalent of, and is calculated in the same manner as, the SAP combined ratio except that the SAP underwriting expense ratio is based on net \nwritten\n premium and the underwriting expense ratio as used in this report is based on net \nearned\n premiums. \nThe combined ratio is an indicator of the Company’s underwriting discipline, efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business and overall underwriting profitability. A combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss.  \nOther companies’ method of computing a similarly titled measure may not be comparable to the Company’s method of computing this ratio.\nCommercial multi-peril policies\nRefers to policies which cover both property and third-party liability exposures.\nCommutation agreement\nAn agreement between a reinsurer and a ceding company whereby the reinsurer pays an agreed-upon amount in exchange for a complete discharge of all obligations, including future obligations, between the parties for reinsurance losses incurred.\nCore income (loss)\nConsolidated net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses), discontinued operations, the effect of a change in tax laws and tax rates at enactment date, and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles when applicable.  Financial statement users consider core income when analyzing the results and trends of insurance companies.\nDebt-to-total capital ratio\nThe ratio of debt to total capitalization.\nDebt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain (loss) on investments\nThe ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity.\nDeductible\nThe amount of loss that an insured retains.\nDeferred acquisition costs (DAC)\nIncremental direct costs of acquired and renewal insurance contracts, consisting of commissions (other than contingent commissions) and premium-related taxes that are deferred and amortized to achieve a matching of revenues and expenses when reported in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\nDeficiency\nWith regard to reserves for a given liability, a deficiency exists when it is estimated or determined that the reserves are insufficient to pay the ultimate settlement value of the related liabilities. Where the deficiency is the result of an estimate, the estimated amount of deficiency (or even the finding of whether or not a deficiency exists) may change as new information becomes available.\nDemand surge\nSignificant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services, commonly as a result of a large catastrophe resulting in significant widespread property damage.\nDirect written premiums\nThe amounts charged by an insurer to insureds in exchange for coverages provided in accordance with the terms of an insurance contract. The amounts exclude the impact of all reinsurance premiums, either assumed or ceded.\n36\nEarned premiums or premiums earned\nThat portion of property casualty premiums written that applies to the expired portion of the policy term. Earned premiums are recognized as revenues under both SAP and GAAP.\nEarned pricing\nThe impact of renewal premium change on earned premiums relative to the impact of loss cost trends and other related factors on loss and loss adjustment expenses.\n \nExcess and surplus lines insurance\nInsurance for risks not covered by standard insurance due to the unique nature of the risk. Risks could be placed in excess and surplus lines markets due to any number of characteristics, such as loss experience, unique or unusual exposures, or insufficient experience in business.  Excess and surplus lines are less regulated by the states, allowing greater flexibility to design specific insurance coverage and negotiate pricing based on the risks to be secured.\nExcess liability\nAdditional casualty coverage above a layer of insurance exposures.\nExcess-of-loss reinsurance\nReinsurance that indemnifies the reinsured against all or a specified portion of losses over a specified dollar amount or “retention.”\nExposure\nThe measure of risk used in the pricing of an insurance product.  The change in exposure is the amount of change in premium on policies that renew attributable to the change in portfolio risk.\nFacultative reinsurance\nThe reinsurance of all or a portion of the insurance provided by a single policy. Each policy reinsured is separately negotiated.\nFair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan\nA residual market mechanism which provides property insurance to those unable to obtain such insurance through the regular (voluntary) market. FAIR plans are set up on a state-by-state basis to cover only those risks in that state. For more information, see “residual market (involuntary business).”\nFidelity and surety programs\nFidelity insurance coverage protects an insured for loss due to embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an employee. Surety is a three-party agreement in which the insurer agrees to pay a third party or make complete an obligation in response to the default, acts or omissions of an insured.\nGross written premiums\nThe direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.\nGround-up analysis\nA method to estimate ultimate claim costs for a given cohort of claims such as an accident year/product line component. It involves analyzing the exposure and claim activity at an individual insured level and then through the use of deterministic or stochastic scenarios and/or simulations, estimating the ultimate losses for those insureds. The total losses for the cohort are then the sum of the losses for each individual insured.\nIn practice, the method is sometimes simplified by performing the individual insured analysis only for the larger insureds, with the costs for the smaller insureds estimated via sampling approaches (extrapolated to the rest of the smaller insured population) or aggregate approaches (using assumptions consistent with the ground-up larger insured analysis).\nGuaranteed-cost products\nAn insurance policy where the premiums charged will not be adjusted for actual loss experience during the covered period.\n37\nGuaranty fund\nA state-regulated mechanism that is financed by assessing insurers doing business in those states.

Typically, the insurer is responsible for paying the entire loss under those policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount.\nLloyd’s\nAn insurance marketplace based in London, England, where brokers, representing clients with insurable risks, deal with Lloyd’s underwriters, who represent investors. The investors are grouped together into syndicates that provide capital to insure the risks.\nLoss\nAn occurrence that is the basis for submission and/or payment of a claim. Losses may be covered, limited or excluded from coverage, depending on the terms of the policy.\nLoss adjustment expenses (LAE)\nThe expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs.\nLoss and LAE ratio\nFor SAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses less certain administrative services fee income to net earned premiums as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The loss and LAE ratio as used in this report is calculated in the same manner as the SAP ratio.\nThe loss and LAE ratio is an indicator of the Company’s underwriting discipline and underwriting profitability.\nOther companies’ method of computing a similarly titled measure may not be comparable to the Company’s method of computing this ratio.\nLoss reserves\nLiabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect the estimated cost of claims incurred that the insurer or reinsurer will ultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance or reinsurance it has written. Reserves are established for losses and for LAE, and consist of case reserves and IBNR reserves.

Such statistics are subject to change based on a number of factors, including changes in estimates.\nResidual market (involuntary business)\nInsurance market which provides coverage for risks for those unable to purchase insurance in the voluntary market. Possible reasons for this inability include the risks being too great or the profit potential too small under the required insurance rate structure. Residual markets are frequently created by state legislation either because of lack of available coverage such as: property coverage in a windstorm prone area or protection of the accident victim as in the case of workers’ compensation. The costs of the residual market are usually charged back to the direct insurance carriers in proportion to the carriers’ voluntary market shares for the type of coverage involved.\nRetention\nThe amount of exposure a policyholder company retains on any one risk or group of risks. The term may apply to an insurance policy, where the policyholder is an individual, family or business, or a reinsurance policy, where the policyholder is an insurance company.\nRetention rate\nThe percentage of prior period premiums (excluding renewal premium changes), accounts or policies available for renewal in the current period that were renewed.

The cost is shared by the insurance industry and self-insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self-insureds based on either premiums or losses.\nSegment income (loss)\nDetermined in the same manner as core income (loss) on a segment basis.  Management uses segment income (loss) to analyze each segment’s performance and as a tool in making business decisions.  Financial statement users also consider segment income when analyzing the results and trends of insurance companies.   \nSelf-insured retentions\nThat portion of the risk retained by an insured for its own account.\nServicing carrier\nAn insurance company that provides, for a fee, various services including policy issuance, claims adjusting and customer service for insureds in a reinsurance pool.\nStatutory accounting practices (SAP)\nThe practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by domiciliary state insurance regulatory authorities in the United States for recording transactions and preparing financial statements.

As poorer performing business leaves and pricing segmentation improves on renewal of the business that is retained, the loss and LAE ratio is expected to improve in future years.\nThird-party liability\nA liability owed to a claimant (third party) who is not one of the two parties to the insurance contract. Insured liability claims are referred to as third-party claims.\nTotal capitalization\nThe sum of total shareholders’ equity and debt.\n41\nTreaty reinsurance\nThe reinsurance of a specified type or category of risks defined in a reinsurance agreement (a “treaty”) between a primary insurer or other reinsured and a reinsurer.

The underwriter is expected to select business that will produce an average risk of loss no greater than that anticipated for the class of business.\nUnderwriting\nThe insurer’s or reinsurer’s process of reviewing applications for insurance coverage, and the decision as to whether to accept all or part of the coverage and determination of the applicable premiums; also refers to the acceptance of that coverage.\nUnderwriting expense ratio\nFor SAP, the underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred (including commissions paid), less certain administrative services fee income and billing and policy fees, to net \nwritten\n premiums as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The underwriting expense ratio as used in this report is the ratio of underwriting expenses (including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs), less certain administrative services fee income, billing and policy fees and other, to net \nearned\n premiums.\nThe underwriting expense ratio is an indicator of the Company’s efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business.\nOther companies’ method of computing a similarly titled measure may not be comparable to the Company’s method of computing this ratio.\nUnderwriting gain or loss\nNet earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.\n42\nUnearned premium\nThe portion of premiums written that is allocable to the unexpired portion of the policy term.\nVoluntary market\nThe market in which a person seeking insurance obtains coverage without the assistance of residual market mechanisms.\nWholesale broker\nAn independent or exclusive agent that represents both admitted and non-admitted insurers in market areas, which include standard, non-standard, specialty and excess and surplus lines of insurance.

  "item7": "Item 7.\n        \n \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, including year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023.  Year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 have been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. \nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n2024 Consolidated Results of Operations\n•\nNet income of $5.00 billion, or $21.76 per share basic and $21.47 per share diluted\n•\nNet earned premiums of $41.94 billion \n•\nCatastrophe losses of $3.34 billion ($2.63 billion after-tax)\n•\nNet favorable prior year reserve development of $709 million ($559 million after-tax)\n•\nCombined ratio of 92.5% \n•\nNet investment income of $3.59 billion ($2.95 billion after-tax)\n•\nNet realized investment losses of $30 million ($26 million after-tax)\n•\nOperating cash flows of $9.07 billion \n2024 Consolidated Financial Condition\n•\nTotal investments of $94.22 billion; fixed maturities and short-term securities comprised 94% of total investments\n•\nTotal assets of $133.19 billion \n•\nTotal debt of $8.03 billion, resulting in a debt-to-total capital ratio of 22.4% (20.3% excluding net unrealized investment losses, net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity)\n•\nTotal capital returned to shareholders of $2.11 billion, comprising $1.15 billion of share repurchases and $962 million of dividends\n•\nShareholders’ equity of $27.86 billion \n•\nNet unrealized investment losses of $4.61 billion ($3.64 billion after-tax)\n•\nBook value per common share of $122.97\n•\nHolding company liquidity of $1.80 billion \n62\nCONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions except ratio and per share amounts)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n \n \n \nPremiums\n$\n41,941\n \n$\n37,761 \n$\n33,763 \nNet investment income\n3,590\n \n2,922 \n2,562 \nFee income\n473\n \n433 \n412 \nNet realized investment losses\n(30)\n(105)\n(204)\nOther revenues\n449\n \n353 \n351 \nTotal revenues\n46,423\n \n41,364 \n36,884 \nClaims and expenses \n \n \n \nClaims and claim adjustment expenses\n27,059\n \n26,215 \n22,854 \nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs\n6,973\n \n6,226 \n5,515 \nGeneral and administrative expenses\n5,819\n \n5,176 \n4,810 \nInterest expense\n392\n \n376 \n351 \nTotal claims and expenses\n40,243\n \n37,993 \n33,530 \nIncome before income taxes\n6,180\n \n3,371 \n3,354 \nIncome tax expense\n1,181\n \n380 \n512 \nNet income\n$\n4,999\n \n$\n2,991 \n$\n2,842 \nNet income per share\n \n \n \nBasic\n$\n21.76\n \n$\n12.93 \n$\n11.91 \nDiluted\n$\n21.47\n \n$\n12.79 \n$\n11.77 \nCombined ratio\n \n \n \nLoss and loss adjustment expense ratio\n64.0\n \n%\n68.9 \n%\n67.1 \n%\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n28.5\n \n28.1 \n28.5 \nCombined ratio\n92.5\n \n%\n97.0 \n%\n95.6 \n%\nThe following discussions of the Company’s net income and segment income (loss) are presented on an after-tax basis.  Discussions of the components of net income and segment income (loss) are presented on a pre-tax basis, unless otherwise noted.  Discussions of net income per common share are presented on a diluted basis.\nOverview\nDiluted net income per share of $21.47 in 2024 increased by 68% over diluted net income per share of $12.79 in 2023.  Net income of $5.00 billion in 2024 increased by 67% over net income of $2.99 billion in 2023. The higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The increase in income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (“underlying underwriting margins”), (ii) higher net investment income, (iii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (iv) lower net realized investment losses, partially offset by (v) higher catastrophe losses.  Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2024 and 2023 was $709 million and $143 million, respectively.  Catastrophe losses in 2024 and 2023 were $3.34 billion and $2.99 billion, respectively.  The higher underlying underwriting margins in 2024 were driven by Personal Insurance and Business Insurance, partially offset by Bond & Specialty Insurance. Income tax expense in 2024 was higher than in 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of the increase in income before income taxes, partially offset by a one-time tax benefit of $211 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item.  \nThe Company has insurance operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd’s, as well as in Brazil through a joint venture.  Because these operations are conducted in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted reported line items in the statement of income by insignificant amounts. The impact of these changes was not material to the Company’s net income or segment income (loss) for the periods reported.\n63\nRevenues\nEarned Premiums\nEarned premiums in 2024 were $41.94 billion, $4.18 billion or 11% higher than in 2023. In Business Insurance, earned premiums in 2024 increased by 11% over 2023.  In Bond & Specialty Insurance, earned premiums in 2024 increased by 8% over 2023.  In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2024 increased by 11% over 2023.  Factors contributing to the change in earned premiums in each segment in 2024 as compared with 2023 are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow. \nNet Investment Income\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company’s investments.\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAverage investments\n(1)\n$\n97,012\n \n$\n90,941 \n$\n87,191 \nPre-tax net investment income\n3,590\n \n2,922 \n2,562 \nAfter-tax net investment income\n2,952\n \n$\n2,436 \n2,170 \nAverage pre-tax yield\n(2)\n3.7\n \n%\n3.2 \n%\n2.9 \n%\nAverage after-tax yield\n(2)\n3.0\n \n%\n2.7 \n%\n2.5 \n%\n___________________________________________\n(1)\nExcludes net unrealized investment gains and losses and reflects cash, receivables for investment sales, payables on investment purchases and accrued investment income.\n(2)\nExcludes net realized and net unrealized investment gains and losses.\nNet investment income in 2024 was $3.59 billion, $668 million or 23% higher than in 2023.  Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2024 was $2.95 billion, $476 million higher than in 2023. The increase primarily resulted from higher long-term average yields and a higher average level of fixed maturity investments. Net investment income from short-term securities in 2024 was $280 million, $39 million higher than in 2023. The increase primarily resulted from a higher level of short-term investments and higher short-term average yields. The Company’s remaining investment portfolios had net investment income of $409 million in 2024, $156 million higher than in 2023, primarily reflecting higher private equity partnership returns.  Included in other investments are private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and typically report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company’s financial statements on a quarter lag basis.\nFee Income\nFee income in 2024 was $473 million, $40 million higher than in 2023. The National Accounts market in Business Insurance is the primary source of the Company’s fee-based business and is discussed in the Business Insurance segment discussion that follows. \n64\nNet Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company’s net pre-tax realized investment gains (losses).\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nImpairment gains (losses):\n   Fixed maturities\n$\n(5)\n$\n(3)\n$\n(26)\nReal estate investments\n(5)\n(9)\n(12)\nNet realized investment gains (losses) on equity securities still held\n89\n \n16 \n(61)\nOther net realized investment gains (losses), including from sales\n(109)\n(109)\n(105)\nTotal\n$\n(30)\n$\n(105)\n$\n(204)\nNet realized investment gains on equity securities still held of $89 million in 2024 were driven by the impact of changes in fair value attributable to favorable equity markets. Net realized investment gains on equity securities still held of $16 million in 2023 were driven by the impact of changes in fair value attributable to favorable equity markets, partially offset by a net unfavorable change in fair value on an individual security held in the Company’s portfolio.\nOther net realized investment losses in 2024 included $126 million of net realized investment losses related to fixed maturity investments and $10 million of net realized investment losses related to other investments, partially offset by $17 million of net realized investment gains related to real estate sales and $10 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities sold.  Other net realized investment losses in 2023 included $93 million of net realized investment losses related to fixed maturity investments, $7 million of net realized investment losses related to equity securities sold and $9 million of net realized investment losses related to other investments. \nOther Revenues\nOther revenues in 2024 were $449 million, $96 million higher than 2023. Other revenues include revenues from Simply Business, installment premium charges and other policyholder service charges.\nClaims and Expenses\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2024 were $27.06 billion, $844 million or 3% higher than 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher business volumes in all three segments, (ii) loss cost trends in Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance, (iii) higher catastrophe losses in all three segments and (iv) higher other losses in Business Insurance, partially offset by (v) lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line and lower non-weather and non-catastrophe weather-related losses in the homeowners and other product line in Personal Insurance, (vi) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, including net favorable prior year development compared to net unfavorable development in 2023 in Business Insurance and higher net favorable prior year reserve development in Personal Insurance, partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development in Bond & Specialty Insurance and (vii) the comparison to an elevated level of losses in 2023 from both a small number of surety accounts and loss activity related to the disruption in the banking sector in Bond & Specialty Insurance. Catastrophes in 2024 primarily resulted from Hurricane Helene and numerous severe wind and hail storms in multiple states. Catastrophes in 2023 primarily resulted from numerous severe wind and hail storms in multiple states.\nFactors contributing to net prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nSignificant Catastrophe Losses\nThe Company defines a catastrophe as a severe loss event designated, or reasonably expected by the Company to be designated, a catastrophe by one or more industry recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada. \nCatastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other destructive acts, including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions and destruction of infrastructure. The effects of catastrophes are included in net income (loss) and core income (loss) and claims and claim adjustment expense \n65\nreserves upon occurrence. A catastrophe may also result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools and associations.\nThe Company’s threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is reached and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company.  Additionally, an aggregate threshold is applied for International business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2024 ranged from approximately $20 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.\nThe following table presents the amount of losses recorded by the Company for significant catastrophes that occurred in 2024, 2023 and 2022, the amount of net unfavorable (favorable) prior year reserve development recognized in 2024 and 2023 for catastrophes that occurred in 2023 and 2022, and the estimate of ultimate losses for those catastrophes at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.  For purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its ultimate losses will be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes.\n \nLosses Incurred / Unfavorable (Favorable)\nPrior Year Reserve Development for the    Year Ended December 31,\nEstimated Ultimate Losses at\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, pre-tax and net of reinsurance)\n(1)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2022\nPCS Serial Number:\n33 — Severe wind and hail storms\n(4)\n1 \n137 \n134 \n138 \n137 \n35 — Severe wind and hail storms\n(3)\n— \n184 \n181 \n184 \n184 \n43 — Severe wind and hail storms\n1 \n(6)\n122 \n117 \n116 \n122 \n61 — Hurricane Ian\n(1)\n(76)\n227 \n150 \n151 \n227 \n73 — Winter storm\n11 \n158 \n512 \n681 \n670 \n512 \n2023\nPCS Serial Number:\n25 — Severe wind and hail storms\n(6)\n153 \nn/a\n147 \n153 \nn/a\n32 — Severe wind and hail storms\n(5)\n140 \nn/a\n135 \n140 \nn/a\n33 — Severe wind and hail storms\n(10)\n199 \nn/a\n189 \n199 \nn/a\n35 — Severe wind and hail storms\n— \n140 \nn/a\n140 \n140 \nn/a\n38 — Severe wind and hail storms\n3 \n110 \nn/a\n113 \n110 \nn/a\n42 — Severe wind and hail storms\n4 \n133 \nn/a\n137 \n133 \nn/a\n48 — Severe wind and hail storms\n(6)\n150 \nn/a\n144 \n150 \nn/a\n49 — Severe wind and hail storms\n2 \n133 \nn/a\n135 \n133 \nn/a\n51 — Severe wind and hail storms\n(34)\n265 \nn/a\n231 \n265 \nn/a\n63 — Severe wind and hail storms\n5 \n125 \nn/a\n130 \n125 \nn/a\n75 — Severe wind and hail storms\n(17)\n190 \nn/a\n173 \n190 \nn/a\n2024\nPCS Serial Number:\n26 — Severe wind and hail storms\n261 \nn/a\nn/a\n261 \nn/a\nn/a\n39 — Severe wind and hail storms\n250 \nn/a\nn/a\n250 \nn/a\nn/a\n42 — Severe wind and hail storms\n161 \nn/a\nn/a\n161 \nn/a\nn/a\n44 — Severe wind and hail storms\n171 \nn/a\nn/a\n171 \nn/a\nn/a\n45 — Severe wind and hail storms\n159 \nn/a\nn/a\n159 \nn/a\nn/a\n46 — Severe wind and hail storms\n182 \nn/a\nn/a\n182 \nn/a\nn/a\n61 — Severe wind and hail storms\n144 \nn/a\nn/a\n144 \nn/a\nn/a\n77 — Hurricane Helene\n733 \nn/a\nn/a\n733 \nn/a\nn/a\n___________________________________________\n66\nn/a: not applicable.\n(1)  Amounts are reported pre-tax and net of recoveries under all applicable reinsurance treaties, except for the Company’s 2022 Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Treaties. That treaty covered the accumulation of certain property losses arising from one or multiple occurrences (both catastrophe and non-catastrophe events) for the period January 1, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022. As a result, the benefit from that treaty is not included in the table above as the allocation of the treaty’s benefit to each identified catastrophe changes each time there are additional events or changes in estimated losses from any covered event.  \nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2024 was $6.97 billion, $747 million or 12% higher than in 2023.  The increase in 2024 was generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2024 were $5.82 billion, $643 million or 12% higher than in 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of costs associated with higher business volumes.  General and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in 2024 and 2023 was $392 million and $376 million, respectively.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense in 2024 was $1.18 billion, $801 million or 211% higher than in 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of the $2.81 billion increase in income before income taxes in 2024 and the one-time tax benefit of $211 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was 19% and 11% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2023 was reduced by the impact of the one-time tax benefit discussed above.  The effective tax rates in both years reflected the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company’s income tax provision.  \nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio of 92.5% in 2024 was 4.5 points lower than the combined ratio of 97.0% in 2023. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 64.0% in 2024 was 4.9 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 68.9% in 2023. The underwriting expense ratio of 28.5% in 2024 was 0.4 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 28.1% in 2023. \nCatastrophe losses in 2024 and 2023 accounted for 8.0 points and 7.9 points, respectively, of the combined ratio.  Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2024 and 2023 provided 1.7 points and 0.4 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. The combined ratio excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses (“underlying combined ratio”) in 2024 was 3.3 points lower than the 2023 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the benefit of earned pricing in Personal Insurance and Business Insurance, partially offset by Bond & Specialty Insurance, (ii) lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line and lower non-weather and non-catastrophe weather-related losses in the homeowners and other product line in Personal Insurance and (iii) the comparison to an elevated level of losses in 2023 from both a small number of surety accounts and loss activity related to the disruption in the banking sector in Bond & Specialty Insurance, partially offset by (iv) higher other losses in Business Insurance.\nThe combined ratio continues to be impacted by the tort environment, including more aggressive attorney involvement in insurance claims.\n67\nWritten Premiums\nConsolidated gross and net written premiums were as follows:\n \nGross Written Premiums\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBusiness Insurance\n$\n24,515\n \n$\n22,569 \n$\n19,521 \nBond & Specialty Insurance\n4,519\n \n4,187 \n4,082 \nPersonal Insurance\n17,516\n \n16,216 \n14,273 \nTotal\n$\n46,550\n \n$\n42,972 \n$\n37,876 \n \nNet Written Premiums\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBusiness Insurance\n$\n22,078\n \n$\n20,430 \n$\n17,635 \nBond & Specialty Insurance\n4,109\n \n3,842 \n3,732 \nPersonal Insurance\n17,169\n \n15,929 \n14,047 \nTotal\n$\n43,356\n \n$\n40,201 \n$\n35,414 \nGross and net written premiums in 2024 both increased by 8% over 2023.

The increase in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher net investment income, (ii) higher underlying underwriting margins and (iii) net favorable prior year reserve development compared to net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2023, partially offset by (iv) higher catastrophe losses. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2024 was $90 million. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2023 was $289 million.  Catastrophe losses in 2024 and 2023 were $1.03 billion and $838 million, respectively. The higher underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the impacts of (i) higher business volumes and (ii) the benefit of earned pricing, partially offset by (iii) higher other losses and (iv) higher general and administrative expenses. Income tax expense in 2024 was higher than in 2023, \n68\nprimarily reflecting the impact of the increase in segment income before income taxes and a one-time tax benefit of $171 million in the first quarter of 2023.\nRevenues\nEarned Premiums\nEarned premiums in 2024 were $21.35 billion, $2.20 billion or 11% higher than in 2023, primarily reflecting the increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months.     \nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income in 2024 was $2.56 billion, $475 million or 23% higher than in 2023.  Refer to the “Net Investment Income” section of the “Consolidated Results of Operations” discussion for a description of the factors contributing to the increase in the Company’s consolidated net investment income in 2024 compared with 2023. In addition, refer to note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company’s net investment income allocation methodology.  \nFee Income\nNational Accounts is the primary source of fee income due to revenue from its large deductible policies and service businesses, which include risk management, claims administration, loss control and risk management information services provided to third parties, as well as policy issuance and claims management services to workers’ compensation residual market pools. Fee income in 2024 was $430 million, $30 million or 8% higher than in 2023, primarily reflecting higher claim volume under administration associated with large deductible policies and the service business. \nOther Revenues\nOther revenues in 2024 were $322 million, $90 million or 39% higher than in 2023, driven by growth in Simply Business. Other revenues also include installment premium charges and other policyholder service charges.\nClaims and Expenses\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2024 were $13.68 billion, $983 million or 8% higher than in 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher business volumes, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher other losses and (iv) higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (v) net favorable prior year reserve development compared to net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2023.\nFactors contributing to net prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2024 was $3.59 billion, $415 million or 13% higher than in 2023, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.  \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2024 were $3.30 billion, $262 million or 9% higher than in 2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily in support of business growth.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense in 2024 was $781 million, $413 million or 112% higher than in 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of the $1.14 billion increase in segment income before income taxes in 2024 and the one-time tax benefit of $171 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item.\n69\nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio of 92.5% in 2024 was 2.2 points lower than the combined ratio of 94.7% in 2023.  The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 63.1% in 2024 was 2.2 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 65.3% in 2023.  The underwriting expense ratio of 29.4% in 2024 was comparable with the underwriting expense ratio in 2023.\nCatastrophe losses in 2024 and 2023 accounted for 4.8 points and 4.3 points, respectively, of the combined ratio.  Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2024 provided 0.4 points of benefit to the combined ratio.  Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2023 accounted for 1.5 points of the combined ratio.  The underlying combined ratio in 2024 was 0.8 points lower than the 2023 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of the benefit of earned pricing, partially offset by higher other losses.\nWritten Premiums\nBusiness Insurance’s gross and net written premiums by market were as follows:\n \nGross Written Premiums\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDomestic:\n \n \n \nSelect Accounts\n$\n3,768\n \n$\n3,502 \n$\n3,126 \nMiddle Market\n12,971\n \n11,800 \n10,532 \nNational Accounts\n1,786\n \n1,665 \n1,642 \nNational Property and Other\n3,828\n \n3,630 \n2,942 \nTotal Domestic\n22,353\n \n20,597 \n18,242 \nInternational\n2,162\n \n1,972 \n1,279 \nTotal Business Insurance\n$\n24,515\n \n$\n22,569 \n$\n19,521 \n \nNet Written Premiums\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDomestic:\n \n \n \nSelect Accounts\n$\n3,727\n \n$\n3,477 \n$\n3,099 \nMiddle Market\n12,023\n \n11,045 \n9,923 \nNational Accounts\n1,259\n \n1,135 \n1,085 \nNational Property and Other\n3,134\n \n3,008 \n2,467 \nTotal Domestic\n20,143\n \n18,665 \n16,574 \nInternational\n1,935\n \n1,765 \n1,061 \nTotal Business Insurance\n$\n22,078\n \n$\n20,430 \n$\n17,635 \nGross and net written premiums in 2024 increased by 9% and 8%, respectively, over 2023.    \nSelect Accounts\n.

The decrease in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins, partially offset by (iii) higher net investment income. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2024 and 2023 was $129 million and $285 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2024 and 2023 were $51 million and $37 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected (i) higher general and administrative expenses and (ii) the impact of earned pricing, partially offset by (iii) higher business volumes and (iv) the comparison to an elevated level of losses in 2023 from both a small number of surety accounts and loss activity related to the disruption in the banking sector. Income tax expense in 2024 was lower than in 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of the decrease in segment income before income taxes, partially offset by a one-time tax benefit of $9 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item. \nRevenues\nEarned Premiums\nEarned premiums in 2024 were $3.96 billion, $303 million or 8% higher than in 2023, primarily reflecting an increase in net written premiums, including the impact of longer duration surety bonds and multi-year management liability policies.  \nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income in 2024 was $390 million, $62 million or 19% higher than in 2023.

The underwriting expense ratio of 39.9% in 2024 was 3.1 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 36.8% in 2023.\nNet favorable prior year reserve development in 2024 and 2023 provided 3.3 points and 7.8 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio.  Catastrophe losses in 2024 and 2023 accounted for 1.3 points and 1.0 points, respectively, of the combined ratio.  The underlying combined ratio in 2024 was 2.6 points higher than the 2023 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting (i) a higher expense ratio and (ii) the impact of earned pricing, partially offset by (iii) the comparison to an elevated level of losses in 2023 from both small number of surety accounts and loss activity related to the disruption in the banking sector.\nWritten Premiums\nBond & Specialty Insurance’s gross and net written premiums were as follows:\n \nGross Written Premiums\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDomestic:\n \n \n \nManagement Liability\n$\n2,599\n \n$\n2,391 \n$\n2,361 \nSurety\n1,387\n \n1,219 \n1,153 \nTotal Domestic\n3,986\n \n3,610 \n3,514 \nInternational\n533\n \n577 \n568 \nTotal Bond & Specialty Insurance\n$\n4,519\n \n$\n4,187 \n$\n4,082 \n \nNet Written Premiums\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDomestic:\n \n \n \nManagement Liability\n$\n2,309\n \n$\n2,156 \n$\n2,112 \nSurety\n1,294\n \n1,147 \n1,081 \nTotal Domestic\n3,603\n \n3,303 \n3,193 \nInternational\n506\n \n539 \n539 \nTotal Bond & Specialty Insurance\n$\n4,109\n \n$\n3,842 \n$\n3,732 \n72\nGross written premiums and net written premiums in 2024 increased by 8% and 7%, respectively, over 2023.\nDomestic\n.  Net written premiums of $3.60 billion in 2024 increased by 9% over 2023.  Excluding the surety line of business, for which the following are not relevant measures, retention rates remained strong in 2024 and were comparable with 2023. Renewal premium changes in 2024 remained positive but were lower than in 2023.  New business premiums in 2024 increased over 2023, driven by Corvus. \nInternational.\n  Net written premiums of $506 million in 2024 decreased by 6% from 2023, driven by decreases in the United Kingdom and broader Europe, partially offset by increases in Canada. \nPersonal Insurance\nResults of Personal Insurance were as follows:\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n \n \n \nEarned premiums\n$\n16,638\n \n$\n14,962 \n$\n13,250 \nNet investment income\n640\n \n509 \n440 \nFee income\n43\n \n33 \n30 \nOther revenues\n97\n \n96 \n83 \nTotal revenues\n17,418\n \n15,600 \n13,803 \nTotal claims and expenses\n15,875\n \n15,831 \n14,033 \nSegment income (loss) before income taxes\n1,543\n \n(231)\n(230)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n294\n \n(103)\n(90)\nSegment income (loss)\n$\n1,249\n \n$\n(128)\n$\n(140)\nLoss and loss adjustment expense ratio\n69.7\n \n%\n80.4 \n%\n79.8 \n%\nUnderwriting expense ratio\n24.7\n \n24.4 \n25.1 \nCombined ratio\n94.4\n \n%\n104.8 \n%\n104.9 \n%\nOverview\nSegment income in 2024 was $1.25 billion, compared with a segment loss of $128 million in 2023. The increase in segment income before income taxes was driven by the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher underlying underwriting margins, (ii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (iii) higher net investment income, partially offset by (iv) higher catastrophe losses.  Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2024 and 2023 was $490 million and $147 million, respectively.  Catastrophe losses in 2024 and 2023 were $2.25 billion and $2.12 billion, respectively.  The higher underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the impacts of (i) the benefit of earned pricing, (ii) lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line, (iii) lower non-weather and non-catastrophe weather-related losses in the homeowners and other product line and (iv) higher business volumes. The segment recorded income tax expense in 2024 compared to an income tax benefit in 2023. The change in income taxes primarily reflected the impact of the increase in segment income before income taxes and a one-time tax benefit of $31 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item.  \nRevenues\nEarned Premiums\nEarned premiums in 2024 were $16.64 billion, $1.68 billion or 11% higher than in 2023, primarily reflecting the increase in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months.\n73\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income in 2024 was $640 million, $131 million or 26% higher than in 2023. Refer to the “Net Investment Income” section of the “Consolidated Results of Operations” discussion for a description of the factors contributing to the increase in the Company’s consolidated net investment income in 2024 as compared with 2023. In addition, refer to note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company’s net investment income allocation methodology.  \nOther Revenues\nOther revenues in all years presented primarily consisted of installment premium charges.\nClaims and Expenses \nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses in 2024 were $11.61 billion, $428 million or 4% lower than in 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, (ii) lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line and (iii) lower non-weather and non-catastrophe weather-related losses in the homeowners and other product line, partially offset by (iv) higher business volumes and (v) higher catastrophe losses. \nFactors contributing to net prior year reserve development are discussed in more detail in note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAmortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2024 was $2.63 billion, $249 million or 10% higher than in 2023, generally consistent with the increase in earned premiums.  \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2024 were $1.64 billion, $223 million or 16% higher than in 2023.  The increase primarily reflected higher contingent commissions, as well as higher employee and technology related expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense in 2024 was $294 million, compared with an income tax benefit of $103 million in 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of the $1.77 billion increase in segment income before income taxes and the one-time tax benefit of $31 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item.\nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio of 94.4% in 2024 was 10.4 points lower than the combined ratio of 104.8% in 2023. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 69.7% in 2024 was 10.7 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 80.4% in 2023.  The underwriting expense ratio of 24.7% in 2024 was 0.3 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 24.4% in 2023. \nCatastrophe losses accounted for 13.5 points and 14.1 points of the combined ratio in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2024 and 2023 provided 3.0 points and 1.0 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio in 2024 was 7.8 points lower than the 2023 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) the benefit of earned pricing, (ii) lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line and (iii) lower non-weather and non-catastrophe weather-related losses in the homeowners and other product line.  \n74\nWritten Premiums\nPersonal Insurance’s gross and net written premiums were as follows:\n \nGross Written Premiums\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDomestic:\n \n \n \nAutomobile\n$\n7,949\n \n$\n7,352 \n$\n6,507 \nHomeowners and Other\n8,845\n \n8,190 \n7,099 \nTotal Domestic\n16,794\n \n15,542 \n13,606 \nInternational\n722\n \n674 \n667 \nTotal Personal Insurance\n$\n17,516\n \n$\n16,216 \n$\n14,273 \n \nNet Written Premiums\n(for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDomestic:\n \n \n \nAutomobile\n$\n7,925\n \n$\n7,330 \n$\n6,482 \nHomeowners and Other\n8,550\n \n7,949 \n6,916 \nTotal Domestic\n16,475\n \n15,279 \n13,398 \nInternational\n694\n \n650 \n649 \nTotal Personal Insurance\n$\n17,169\n \n$\n15,929 \n$\n14,047 \nGross and net written premiums in 2024 both increased by 8% over 2023.\nDomestic\nAutomobile net written premiums of $7.93 billion in 2024 increased by 8% over 2023.

After-tax interest expense in 2024 and 2023 was $310 million and $297 million, respectively. \n75\nASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION\nThe Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. The Company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims.  Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on defendants, such as manufacturers of talcum powder, who were not traditionally sued and/or primary targets of asbestos litigation.  Many defendants have also been subject to increased settlement demands, in part due to the bankruptcy of many traditional primary targets of asbestos litigation. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket.  Prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the Company.  The Company’s asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers.  \nThe Company continues to be involved in disputes, including litigation, with a number of policyholders, some of whom are in bankruptcy, over coverage for asbestos-related claims. Many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company, but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. Although the Company has seen a reduction in the overall risk associated with these disputes, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims.  As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities. \nIn addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers’ conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries.  While the number of direct actions has decreased significantly over time, it is possible that additional direct actions against insurers, including the Company, could be filed in the future.   It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs would be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to any such claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.\nThe Company’s net asbestos reserves at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $1.34 billion and $1.38 billion, respectively, and include case reserves, IBNR reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation. IBNR reserves include amounts for new claims and adverse development on existing policyholders, as well as reserves for claims from policyholders reporting asbestos claims for the first time and for policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation. Asbestos reserves also include amounts related to certain policyholders with whom the Company has entered into permanent settlement agreements, which are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement.  Additionally, a portion of the asbestos reserves relates to assumed reinsurance contracts, primarily consisting of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations.  \nBecause each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally conducts an in-depth asbestos claim review on an annual basis, including a review of domestic policyholders with open claims and litigation cases for potential product and “non-product” liability.  Policyholders are identified for this review based upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims, products/completed operations and potential “non-product” exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder.\nAmong the factors the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder’s potential liability, including as a result of the bankruptcy of other defendants; the jurisdictions involved, including any trends, judicial rulings or legislative actions in those jurisdictions; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; the potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.\nThe Company also reviews its asbestos reserves quarterly.  These reviews include, as appropriate, an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative \n76\nactions.  The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders and the assumed reinsurance component of reserves, as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity.  Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves, and the Company’s evaluations have not resulted in a reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment. \nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review.  While the latest available government data continue to reflect a declining trend in deaths caused by mesothelioma, the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims was relatively flat compared to 2023.  Net asbestos paid loss and loss adjustment expenses in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $282 million, $212 million and $245 million, respectively.  Payments on behalf of these policyholders continue to be influenced by the factors described above, including an increase in severity for certain policyholders and a high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury, primarily mesothelioma, continue to target defendants who were not traditionally sued and/or primary targets of asbestos litigation. The completion of the analyses described above and the annual review in the third quarters of 2024, 2023 and 2022 resulted in $242 million, $284 million and $212 million increases, respectively, to the Company’s net asbestos reserves.  In each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company’s estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders.  The increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs primarily resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the continued high level of mesothelioma claim filings and the impact of the current litigation environment surrounding those claims discussed above. The 2023 charge also included an additional increase to strengthen the Company’s carried reserve position relative to the range of reasonable estimates. \nOver the past decade, the property and casualty insurance industry, including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to asbestos reserves, but the Company believes that over that period there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company’s overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment has evolved from one dominated by exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to the aggregate limits contained in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company’s overall view of the current underlying\n \nasbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.\n77\nThe following table displays activity for asbestos losses and loss adjustment expenses and reserves:\n(at and for the year ended December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning reserves:\n \n \n \nGross\n$\n1,768\n \n$\n1,674 \n$\n1,687 \nCeded\n(390)\n(369)\n(346)\nNet\n1,378\n \n1,305 \n1,341 \nIncurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:\n \nGross\n279\n \n374 \n287 \nCeded\n(37)\n(90)\n(75)\nNet\n242\n \n284 \n212 \nPaid loss and loss adjustment expenses:\n \nGross\n339\n \n281 \n298 \nCeded\n(57)\n(69)\n(53)\nNet\n282\n \n212 \n245 \nForeign exchange and other:\n \nGross\n—\n \n1 \n(2)\nCeded\n—\n \n— \n(1)\nNet\n—\n \n1 \n(3)\nEnding reserves:\n \nGross\n1,708\n \n1,768 \n1,674 \nCeded\n(370)\n(390)\n(369)\nNet\n$\n1,338\n \n$\n1,378 \n$\n1,305 \nENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION\nThe Company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of the alleged storage, emissions or disposal of toxic substances, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s.   These claims are mainly brought pursuant to various state or federal statutes that require a liable party to undertake or pay for environmental remediation.  For example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under these statutes may be joint and several with other responsible parties. The Company has also been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims.  The Company believes that some court decisions pertaining to environmental claims have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. For more information regarding environmental claims and litigation, see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $78 million, $93 million and $132 million, respectively.  Net environmental paid loss and loss adjustment expenses in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $80 million, $82 million and $82 million, respectively.  Net environmental reserves were $380 million, $382 million and $371 million at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  \nUNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES\nAs a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management’s judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation:\n•\nthe risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation;\n78\n•\na further increase in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated;\n•\nthe emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle improvements;\n•\nthe continued application of more stringent cleanup standards on existing and emerging contaminants;\n•\nthe role of any umbrella or excess policies we have issued;\n•\nthe resolution or adjudication of disputes concerning coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with our previous assessment of these disputes;\n•\nthe number and outcome of direct actions against us;\n•\nfuture developments pertaining to our ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims;\n•\nany impact on asbestos or environmental defendants we insure due to the bankruptcy of other asbestos or environmental defendants;\n•\nthe unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers; and\n•\nuncertainties arising from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders.\nChanges in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment may impact the future resolution of asbestos and environmental claims and result in adverse loss reserve development.  The emergence of a greater number of asbestos or environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated may result in adverse loss reserve development.  Changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims, could affect the settlement of asbestos and environmental claims.  It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.\nBecause of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company’s current reserves.  In addition, the Company’s estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change.  These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company’s operating results in future periods.\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO\nThe Company’s invested assets at December 31, 2024 were $94.22 billion, of which 94% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate investments and 4% in other investments.  Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a thoughtful investment philosophy that focuses on appropriate risk-adjusted returns.  A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt and taxable U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds. \nThe carrying value of the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2024 was $83.67 billion.  The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company’s insurance and debt obligations.  The weighted average credit quality of the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was “Aa2” at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.  Below investment grade securities represented 1.2% and 1.3% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.3 (4.5 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2024 and 4.1 (4.4 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2023.\n79\nThe carrying values of investments in fixed maturities classified as available for sale at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n \n2024\n2023\n(at December 31, in millions)\nCarrying Value\nWeighted Average Credit\nQuality (1)\nCarrying Value\nWeighted Average Credit\nQuality (1)\nU.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities\n$\n5,570\n \nAaa/Aa1\n$\n6,368 \nAaa/Aa1\nObligations of U.S. states, municipalities and political subdivisions:\nLocal general obligation\n17,023\n \nAaa/Aa1\n17,199 \nAaa/Aa1\nRevenue\n8,580\n \nAaa/Aa1\n9,184 \nAaa/Aa1\nState general obligation\n1,010\n \nAaa/Aa1\n1,157 \nAaa/Aa1\nPre-refunded\n572\n \nAaa/Aa1\n966 \nAaa/Aa1\nTotal obligations of U.S. states, municipalities and political subdivisions\n27,185\n \n28,506 \nDebt securities issued by foreign governments\n909\n \nAaa/Aa1\n1,006 \nAaa/Aa1\nMortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through securities\n12,605\n \nAaa/Aa1\n7,818 \nAaa/Aa1\nCorporate and all other bonds:\n \n \nFinancial:\n \n \nBank\n4,425\n \nA1\n4,658 \nA1\nInsurance\n2,404\n \nAa2\n2,084 \nAa2\nFinance/leasing\n41\n \nBa3\n63 \nBa2\nBrokerage and asset management\n165\n \nA2\n139 \nA1\nTotal financial\n7,035\n \n6,944 \nIndustrial\n21,940\n \nA3\n19,037 \nA3\nPublic utility\n4,522\n \nA2\n4,338 \nA2\nCanadian municipal securities\n1,641\n \nAa1\n1,604 \nAa1\nSovereign corporate securities \n(2)\n635\n \nAaa\n584 \nAaa\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities and project loans \n(3)\n1,152\n \nAaa\n1,038 \nAaa\nAsset-backed and other\n472\n \nAa2\n564 \nAa1\nTotal corporate and all other bonds\n37,397\n \n34,109 \nTotal fixed maturities\n$\n83,666\n \nAa2\n$\n77,807 \nAa2\n___________________________________________\n(1)\nRated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist.\n(2)\nSovereign corporate securities include corporate securities that are backed by a government and include sovereign banks and securities issued under the Federal Ship Financing Programs.\n(3)\nIncluded in commercial mortgage-backed securities and project loans at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $327 million and $116 million of securities guaranteed by the U.S. government, respectively.\n80\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio rated using external ratings agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist:\n(at December 31, 2024, in millions)\nCarrying\nValue\nPercent of Total\nCarrying Value\nQuality Rating:\n \n \nAaa\n$\n40,411\n \n48.3\n \n%\nAa\n15,278\n \n18.3\n \nA\n16,181\n \n19.3\n \nBaa\n10,816\n \n12.9\n \nTotal investment grade\n82,686\n \n98.8\n \nBelow investment grade\n980\n \n1.2\n \nTotal fixed maturities\n$\n83,666\n \n100.0\n \n%\nObligations of U.S. States, Municipalities and Political Subdivisions\nThe Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023 included $27.19 billion and $28.51 billion, respectively, of securities which are obligations of U.S. states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio).  The municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar issuers.  Included in the municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $572 million and $966 million, respectively, of pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for which U.S. states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities.  These trusts were created to fund the payment of principal and interest due under the bonds. The irrevocable trusts are verified as to their sufficiency by an independent verification agent of the underwriter, issuer or trustee.  All of the Company’s holdings of securities issued by Puerto Rico and related entities have either been pre-refunded and therefore are defeased by U.S. Treasury securities or have FHA guarantees subject to federal appropriation.\n81\nThe following table shows the geographic distribution of the $26.61 billion of municipal bonds at December 31, 2024 that were not pre-refunded:\n(at December 31, 2024, in millions)\nState General\nObligation\nLocal General\nObligation\nRevenue\nTotal Carrying\nValue\nWeighted Average\nCredit\nQuality(1)\nState:\n \n \n \n \n \nTexas\n$\n83\n \n$\n3,285\n \n$\n1,075\n \n$\n4,443\n \nAaa\nCalifornia\n—\n \n1,992\n \n321\n \n2,313\n \nAaa/Aa1\nVirginia\n40\n \n903\n \n813\n \n1,756\n \nAaa\nNorth Carolina\n167\n \n652\n \n420\n \n1,239\n \nAaa\nWisconsin\n170\n \n852\n \n69\n \n1,091\n \nAa1\nMinnesota\n104\n \n815\n \n148\n \n1,067\n \nAaa/Aa1\nWashington\n88\n \n752\n \n186\n \n1,026\n \nAaa/Aa1\nColorado\n—\n \n598\n \n325\n \n923\n \nAa1\nTennessee\n—\n \n837\n \n51\n \n888\n \nAa1\nMaryland\n—\n \n748\n \n113\n \n861\n \nAaa/Aa1\nGeorgia\n152\n \n597\n \n66\n \n815\n \nAaa/Aa1\nMassachusetts\n—\n \n216\n \n505\n \n721\n \nAaa/Aa1\nFlorida\n38\n \n182\n \n486\n \n706\n \nAaa/Aa1\nAll others \n(2)\n168\n \n4,594\n \n4,002\n \n8,764\n \nAaa/Aa1\nTotal\n$\n1,010\n \n$\n17,023\n \n$\n8,580\n \n$\n26,613\n \nAaa/Aa1\n___________________________________________\n(1)\nRated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist.  Ratings shown are the higher of the rating of the underlying issuer or the insurer in the case of securities enhanced by third-party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of issuer default.\n(2)\nNo other single state accounted for 2.5% or more of the total non-pre-refunded municipal bonds.\n82\nThe following table displays the funding sources for the $8.58 billion of municipal bonds identified as revenue bonds in the foregoing table at December 31, 2024:\n(at December 31, 2024, in millions)\nCarrying\nValue\nWeighted Average\nCredit\nQuality(1)\nSource:\n \n \nWater\n$\n2,606\n \nAaa/Aa1\nHigher education\n2,095\n \nAaa/Aa1\nSewer\n872\n \nAaa/Aa1\nPower utilities\n480\n \nAa1\nSpecial tax\n407\n \nAaa/Aa1\nTransit\n225\n \nAa1\nFuel sales\n196\n \nAaa/Aa1\nHealth care\n173\n \nAa2\nHousing\n164\n \nAaa\nHighway tolls\n150\n \nAa2\nLease\n28\n \nAaa/Aa1\nPort, airport and marina\n8\n \nAa2\nIndustrial\n8\n \nAaa/Aa1\nNatural gas\n6\n \nAa2\nLottery\n3\n \nAa1\nOther revenue sources\n1,159\n \nAaa/Aa1\nTotal\n$\n8,580\n \nAaa/Aa1\n___________________________________________\n(1)\nRated using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist.

While prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the Company’s investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges.  The Company makes investments in residential CMOs that are either guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective securitizations.  Both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential CMOs allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders.  In addition, non-guaranteed residential CMOs provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders.  Senior and super-senior CMOs are protected, to varying degrees, from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders.  The Company’s investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable return given the Company’s assessment of associated risks.  The Company does not purchase residual interests in CMOs.  For more information regarding the Company’s investments in residential mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  \n84\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Project Loans\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including FHA project loans) of $1.15 billion and $1.04 billion, respectively.  For more information regarding the Company’s investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nEquity Securities, Real Estate and Short-Term Investments\nSee note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset classes.\nOther Investments\nThe Company also invests in private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships, and joint ventures.  These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than investments in fixed maturities but are subject to more volatility.  The Company also enters into certain derivative financial instruments from time to time that are reported as part of other investments.  At  December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of the Company’s other investments was $4.20 billion and $4.30 billion, respectively.  The Company has unfunded commitments to private equity limited partnerships, real estate partnerships and others in which it invests.  These commitments totaled $1.49 billion and $2.05 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  It is the opinion of the Company’s management that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet these commitments. \nSecurities Lending\nThe Company has, from time to time, engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of its investments to other institutions for short periods of time.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $586 million and $421 million, respectively, of securities on loan, respectively, as part of a tri-party lending agreement. The average monthly balance of securities on loan during 2024 and 2023 was $555 million and $400 million, respectively.  Borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued interest.  The Company did not incur any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nLloyd’s Trust Deposits\nThe Company meets its capital requirements to support its underwriting at Lloyd’s using a combination of the share capital and retained earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries participating in Lloyd’s, trust deposits and uncollateralized letters of credit.  Securities with a fair value of approximately $13 million and $31 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at  December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $86 million and $85 million held by TRV at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were pledged into Lloyd’s trust accounts to provide a portion of the Lloyd’s capital requirements.  For more information regarding the Company’s utilization of uncollateralized letters of credit, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” herein. \nNet Unrealized Investment Gains (Losses)\nThe net unrealized investment losses that were included in shareholders’ equity were as follows:\n(at December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFixed maturities\n$\n(4,609)\n$\n(3,969)\n$\n(6,217)\nOther\n—\n \n(1)\n(3)\nUnrealized investment losses before tax\n(4,609)\n(3,970)\n(6,220)\nTax benefit\n(969)\n(841)\n(1,322)\nNet unrealized investment losses included in shareholders’ equity at end of year\n$\n(3,640)\n$\n(3,129)\n$\n(4,898)\nNet unrealized investment losses included in shareholders’ equity were $3.64 billion at December 31, 2024 compared with $3.13 billion at December 31, 2023.  At December 31, 2024, the Company had $1.12 billion fixed maturity investments reported at fair value for which fair value was less than 80% of amortized cost.  At December 31, 2023, the Company had $726 million fixed maturity investments reported at fair value for which fair value was less than 80% of amortized cost.  These year-over-year changes were driven by changes in interest rates.  Since the Company generally holds its high-quality fixed maturity investments to maturity, these net unrealized losses are considered temporary in nature and are not expected to result in significant realized losses. In addition, given the temporary nature of net unrealized losses combined with the Company’s strong operating cash flows, which include income received on investments and the proceeds received upon maturity of the \n85\ninvestments, the net unrealized investment loss is not expected to meaningfully impact the Company’s assessment of capital adequacy or liquidity. Equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nFor fixed maturity investments where fair value is less than the carrying value and the Company did not reach a decision to impair, the Company continues to have the intent and ability to hold such investments to a projected recovery in value, which may not be until maturity.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, below investment grade securities comprised 1.2%  and 1.3%, respectively, of the fair value of the Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio. Included in below investment grade securities at December 31, 2024 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $661 million and a fair value of $622 million, resulting in a net pre-tax unrealized investment loss of $39 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented less than 1% of both the amortized cost and fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2024 and accounted for less than 1% of the total gross pre-tax unrealized investment loss in the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2024.\nImpairment Charges\nImpairment charges included in net realized investment losses in the consolidated statement of income were $10 million, $12 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  See note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nPurchases and Sales of Investment Securities\nPurchases and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Company’s ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred pre-tax realized losses of $62 million on the sale of fixed maturity investments having a fair value of $1.27 billion. \nCATASTROPHE MODELING\nThe Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events.  There are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure.  Accordingly, catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable.  \nThe Company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling processes.  The Company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share analyses, external scientific analysis and various other factors, including non-modeled losses, to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk.  These proprietary models are updated regularly as new information and techniques emerge.\nBased on the proprietary and third-party models utilized by the Company, the tables below set forth, as of December 31, 2024, the probabilities that estimated losses, comprising claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses (but excluding unallocated claim adjustment expenses), from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars, net of tax, and as a percentage of the Company’s common equity).  For example, on the basis described below the tables, the Company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the Company’s loss from a single U.S. and Canadian hurricane in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed $2.4 billion, or 8% of the Company’s common equity at  December 31, 2024. \n \nDollars (in billions)\nLikelihood of Exceedance (1)\nSingle U.S. and\nCanadian\nHurricane\nSingle U.S. and\nCanadian\nEarthquake\n2.0% (1-in-50)\n$\n2.0\n \n$\n0.7\n \n1.0% (1-in-100)\n$\n2.4\n \n$\n1.2\n \n0.4% (1-in-250)\n$\n3.7\n \n$\n2.0\n \n0.1% (1-in-1,000)\n$\n9.0\n \n$\n3.2\n \n86\n \nPercentage of Common Equity (2)\nLikelihood of Exceedance\nSingle U.S. and\nCanadian\nHurricane\nSingle U.S. and\nCanadian\nEarthquake\n2.0% (1-in-50)\n6\n \n%\n2\n \n%\n1.0% (1-in-100)\n8\n \n%\n4\n \n%\n0.4% (1-in-250)\n12\n \n%\n6\n \n%\n0.1% (1-in-1,000)\n29\n \n%\n10\n \n%\n___________________________________________\n(1)    \nAn event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a “1-in-50 year event.”  As noted above, however, the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe.  Also, because the probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe. \n(2)\n    \nThe percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of taxes, included in shareholders’ equity.  Net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.  Accordingly, the Company’s management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the Company’s financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions. \nThe loss amounts included in the tables above are based on the Company’s in-force portfolio of direct exposures and do not include assumed business. Additionally, the amounts are as of December 31, 2024, reflect the reinsurance program in place at January 1, 2025, are net of reinsurance, after-tax, and exclude unallocated claim adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates.  For further information regarding the Company’s reinsurance, see “Item 1—Business—Reinsurance.”  The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. and Canadian exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non-property exposures.  The hurricane loss amounts are based on the Company’s catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge.  The amounts for earthquakes reflect U.S. and Canadian property and workers’ compensation exposures.  These loss amounts include the effects of exposure growth, inflation and modeling updates based on recent trends and scientific analysis.  The Company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated loss amounts.  \nCatastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history.  These inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in volatility in the modeled output.  Catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable.  Catastrophe modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect.  Consequently, catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.  In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases.  In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable.\n \nActual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount.  In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period. \nMoreover, the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers’ compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, solar flares and other naturally-occurring events, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber events.  \nIn addition, compared to models for hurricanes, models for earthquakes are less reliable due to there being a more limited number of significant historical events to analyze, while models for tornadoes, hail storms, wildfires and winter storms are newer and may be less reliable due to the highly random geographic nature and size of these events. Accordingly, these models may be less accurate in predicting risks and estimating losses. Further, changes in climate conditions could cause our underlying modeling data to be less predictive, thus limiting our ability to effectively evaluate and manage catastrophe risk.\n \nAs compared to natural catastrophes, modeling for man-made catastrophes, such as terrorism and cyber events, is even more difficult and less reliable, and for some events (both natural and man-made), models are either in early stages of development and, therefore, not widely adopted, or are not available.\n87\nFor more information about the Company’s exposure to catastrophe losses, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas and changing climate conditions, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance” and “Item 1A—Risk Factors—We may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.” \nCHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS\nSevere weather events over the last two decades underscore the unpredictability of climate trends.  For example, the frequency and/or severity of hurricane, tornado, hail and wildfire events in the United States have been more volatile during this time period.  The insurance industry has experienced increased catastrophe losses due to a number of potential causal factors, including, in addition to weather/climate variability, aging infrastructure, more people living in, and moving to, high-risk areas, population growth in areas with weaker enforcement of building codes, urban expansion, an increase in the number of amenities included in, and average size of, a home and increased inflation, including as a result of post-event demand surge.  We believe that changing climate conditions have also likely added to the frequency and severity of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures.  Climate studies by government agencies, academic institutions, catastrophe modeling organizations and other groups indicate that an increase in frequency and/or intensity of hurricanes, hail and severe convective storms, heavy precipitation events and associated river, urban and flash flooding, sea level rise, droughts, heat waves and wildfires has occurred, and can be expected into the future.  Understanding the potential impacts of changing climate conditions is important to the Company’s business. Changing climate conditions are expected to evolve over decades.  Importantly, because most of its policies renew annually, the Company is able to respond to these changes over time through adjustments to its underwriting strategy, product pricing and related policy terms and conditions, as appropriate.  As an example, in recent years the Company has focused on enhancing the strategic management of its catastrophe exposure, adding experts in data science, meteorology, including climate and flood science, wind and structural engineering and geophysics, among others, to its catastrophe management organization. The Company has also established dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril, with the goal of developing industry-leading scientific and underwriting expertise. This expertise has been incorporated into the Company’s product development, risk selection, pricing, capital allocation and claim response. \nThe Company discusses how changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under “Item 1A—Risk Factors.” and “Outlook.” For example, among other things: \n•\nIncreasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by the Company.  See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—High levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas and changing climate conditions, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance” and “—Outlook—Underwriting Gain/Loss.”  Moreover, the Company’s catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased unpredictability in frequency and severity of severe weather events, emerging trends in climate conditions and regulatory responses to catastrophe events not being appropriately reflected in the models, in addition to the other factors mentioned above.  Accordingly, the Company may be subject to increased losses from catastrophes and other weather-related events. \n•\nChanging climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the Company invests.  For example, water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers with significant assets or business activities in the Southwestern United States; more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers with significant assets or business activities in the Southeastern United States, among other areas; and increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions could impact the creditworthiness of issuers affected by such regulations.  In addition, as issuers of securities in which the Company invests become increasingly focused on mitigating the potential environmental impact of their operations, the costs associated with such initiatives could affect the business models and realized returns of such issuers.  See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses.”\n•\nIncreased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the Company and its customers, including state insurance regulations that could impact the Company’s ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. For example, state laws have been passed that restrict a carrier’s ability to cancel or non-renew certain policies within or adjacent to declared state of emergency zip codes and mandate discounts for risk mitigation practices that may not be effective.  If the Company is unable to \n88\nimplement risk-based pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its business may be adversely affected.  See “Item 1—Business—Regulation—U.S. State and Federal Regulation—Regulatory and Legislative Responses to Catastrophes.” In addition, climate change regulation could increase the Company’s customers’ costs of doing business. For example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time, increase loss exposures. Increased regulation may also result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses, and increased claim costs, to the extent such regulations require that damaged homes or businesses be rebuilt according to more expensive specifications.  \n•\nThe full range of potential liability exposures related to changing climate conditions continues to evolve. For example, from time to time third parties sue our policyholders alleging that they caused or contributed to losses associated with changing climate conditions.  In the event any such policyholders were found to be responsible, it could result in them seeking recovery under policies issued by the Company.  Through the Company’s Enterprise Casualty Emerging Risk Committee and its Committee on Climate, Energy and the Environment, the Company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate.  The Company regularly reviews emerging issues, including changing climate conditions, to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain, and court decisions or legislative changes that take place after we issue our policies can result in an unexpected increase in the number of claims and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or our financial position.”\nREINSURANCE RECOVERABLES\nThe Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses.  For additional discussion regarding the Company’s reinsurance coverage, see “Part I—Item 1—Business—Reinsurance.”\nThe following table summarizes the composition of the Company’s reinsurance recoverables:\n(at December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\nGross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses\n$\n3,962\n \n$\n3,895 \nGross structured settlements\n2,626\n \n2,707 \nMandatory pools and associations\n1,531\n \n1,659 \nGross reinsurance recoverables\n8,119\n \n8,261 \nAllowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance\n(119)\n(118)\nNet reinsurance recoverables\n$\n8,000\n \n$\n8,143 \nThe following table presents the Company’s top five reinsurer groups by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2024 (in millions).  Also included is the A.M. Best rating of the Company’s predominant reinsurer from each such reinsurer group at February 13, 2025:\nReinsurer Group\nReinsurance\nRecoverable\nA.M. Best Rating of Group’s Predominant\nReinsurer\nSwiss Re Group\n$\n685 \nA+\nsecond highest of 16 ratings\nBerkshire Hathaway\n458 \nA++\nhighest of 16 ratings\nMunich Re Group\n332 \nA+\nsecond highest of 16 ratings\nAxa Group\n173 \nA+\nsecond highest of 16 ratings\nFairfax Financial Group\n137 \nA+\nsecond highest of 16 ratings\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company held $922 million of collateral in the form of letters of credit, funds and trust agreements held to fully or partially collateralize certain reinsurance recoverables.\nIncluded in net reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements, which are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers’ compensation claims comprise a significant portion.  In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as a reinsurance recoverable and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, \n89\nas the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant.  If it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations.  In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments.  The following table presents the Company’s top five groups by structured settlements at December 31, 2024 (in millions).  Also included is the A.M.

When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles or properties insured).  Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of Business Insurance, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations.  Net written premiums may also be impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOverall, the Company expects that retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong by historical standards during 2025.  \nProperty and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2025 for new business. In each of the Company’s business segments, new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business, given the volume of new business relative to renewal business.  However, in periods of meaningful increases in new business, despite its positive impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of higher new business levels may negatively impact the combined ratio for a period of time. In periods of meaningful decreases in new business, despite its negative impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of lower new business levels may positively impact the combined ratio for a period of time.\nEffective January 1, 2025, the Company renewed a quota share reinsurance agreement with subsidiaries of Fidelis Insurance Holdings Limited (Fidelis) for 2025 pursuant to which the Company assumes 20% of the subject gross written premiums of Fidelis on a risk-attaching basis, subject to a loss ratio cap.  The Company’s portion of premiums from Fidelis is reported as part of the International results of Business Insurance.  The Company also has a minority investment in Fidelis. \nUnderwriting Gain/Loss. \n The Company’s underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins.  Underlying underwriting margins can be impacted by a number of factors, including variability in non-catastrophe weather, large loss and other loss activity; changes in current period loss estimates resulting from prior period loss development; changes in loss cost trends; changes in business mix; changes in reinsurance coverages and/or costs; premium adjustments; and variability in expenses and assessments.\nCatastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur.\n90\nOn average for the ten-year period ended December 31, 2024, the Company experienced approximately 38% of its annual catastrophe losses during the second quarter, primarily arising out of severe wind and hail storms, including tornadoes.  Hurricanes, wildfires and winter storms tend to happen at other times of the year and can also have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.  Catastrophe losses incurred in a particular quarter in any given year may differ materially from historical experience.  In addition, most of the Company’s reinsurance programs renew on January 1 or July 1 of each year, and, therefore, any changes to the availability, cost or coverage terms of such programs will be effective after such dates.\nBeginning in early January 2025, there were a series of severe wildfires that impacted the Pacific Palisades neighborhood and Eaton Canyon area in Southern California. The Company’s preliminary pre-tax estimate of catastrophe losses from these wildfires, including assessments from the California FAIR Plan, and net of estimated recoveries from reinsurance, is $1.7 billion. The catastrophe losses from these wildfires will be reflected in the Company’s first quarter 2025 earnings.\nOver much of the past decade, the Company’s results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development driven by better than expected loss experience.  However, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the Company recognizes in future periods higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year.\nIt is possible that changes in economic conditions, the supply chain, international trade, the labor market and geopolitical tensions, as well as steps taken by federal, state and/or local governments and the Federal Reserve could lead to higher or lower inflation than the Company anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase or decrease in the Company’s loss costs and the need to strengthen or reduce claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.  These impacts of inflation on loss costs and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves could be more pronounced for those lines of business that require a relatively longer period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year and, accordingly, are relatively more inflation sensitive. For a further discussion, see “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors—If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the legal/tort, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.” \nThe Company’s results of operations may be impacted by a number of other factors, including an economic slowdown, a recession, financial market volatility, monetary and fiscal policy measures, heightened geopolitical tensions, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the political and regulatory environment, changes to the U.S. Federal budget and potential changes in tax laws. \nInvestment Portfolio\n.  The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration.  The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.3 (4.5 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2024.  From time to time, the Company enters into short positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio.  At December 31, 2024, the Company had no open U.S. Treasury futures contracts.  The Company regularly evaluates its investment alternatives and mix.  Currently, the majority of the Company’s investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt and taxable U.S. municipal, taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.  \nThe Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate and private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships, and joint ventures.  These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for greater volatility and higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.\nApproximately 30% of the fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three years (including the early redemption of bonds, assuming interest rates (including credit spreads) do not rise significantly by applicable call dates).  As a result, the overall yield on and composition of its portfolio could be meaningfully impacted by the types of investments available for reinvestment with the proceeds of maturing bonds. \nNet investment income is a material contributor to the Company’s results of operations.  Based on the Company’s current expectations for the impact of expected higher reinvestment yields on the Company’s fixed income investments and higher levels of fixed income investments, the Company expects that after-tax net investment income from that portfolio will be approximately $710 million in the first quarter of 2025, increasing to approximately $790 million in the fourth quarter of 2025. This expectation could be impacted by the direction of interest rates and disruptions in global financial markets. Included in other investments are private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method of \n91\naccounting and typically report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income or loss from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company’s financial statements on a quarter lag basis.  The Company’s net investment income in future periods from its non-fixed income investment portfolio will be impacted, positively or negatively, by the performance of global financial markets. \nThe Company had net pre-tax realized investment losses of $30 million in 2024.  Changes in global financial markets could result in net realized investment gains or losses in the Company’s investment portfolio. \nThe Company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment loss of $4.61 billion ($3.64 billion after-tax) in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at  December 31, 2024, compared to $3.97 billion ($3.13 billion after-tax) at December 31, 2023.  The net unrealized investment loss is primarily due to the impact of movements in interest rates.  The increase in the net unrealized investment loss in 2024 was due to increases in interest rates.  While the Company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment reduces the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduces shareholders’ equity, and a declining interest rate environment has the opposite effects.  The net unrealized loss discussed above is considered temporary in nature as it is not due to credit impairments, there is no impact on expected contractual cash flows from fixed maturities, and the Company generally holds its fixed maturity investments to maturity. In addition, given the temporary nature of net unrealized losses combined with the Company’s strong operating cash flows (which include income received on investments and the proceeds received upon maturity of the investments), the net unrealized investment loss is not expected to meaningfully impact the Company’s assessment of capital adequacy or liquidity.  Equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nAdditionally, disruptions in global financial markets could also impact the market value of the Company’s investment portfolio. The Company’s investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions (primarily those related to interest from municipal bonds) and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign tax credits). Changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of the Company’s investment portfolio. See “Our businesses are heavily regulated by the states and countries in which we conduct business, including licensing, market conduct and financial supervision, and changes in regulation, including changes in tax regulation, may reduce our profitability and limit our growth” included in “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors.” \nFor further discussion of the Company’s investment portfolio, see “Investment Portfolio.” For a discussion of the risks to the Company’s business during or following a financial market disruption and risks to the Company’s investment portfolio, see the risk factors entitled “During or following a period of financial market disruption or an economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected” and “Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses” included in “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors.”  For a discussion of the risks to the Company’s investments from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see the risk factor entitled “We are subject to additional risks associated with our business outside the United States” included in “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors” and see “Part II—Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.” \nCapital Position.\n The Company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value, expects to continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders, subject to the considerations described below.  The Company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed net income.  The Company also expects that to the extent that it continues to grow premium volumes, the level of capital to support the Company’s financial strength ratings will also increase, and accordingly, the amount of capital returned to shareholders relative to earnings would be somewhat less than it otherwise would have been absent the growth in premium volumes. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of additional factors, including the Company’s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels appropriate for the Company’s business operations, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company’s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws and other factors. For information regarding the Company’s common share repurchases in 2024, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” herein.\nAs a result of the Company’s business outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom (including Lloyd’s), the Republic of Ireland and in Brazil through a joint venture, the Company’s capital is also subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to other currencies could result in a reduction in shareholders’ equity, while a weakening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to other currencies could result in an \n92\nincrease in shareholders’ equity.  For additional discussion of the Company’s foreign exchange market risk exposure, see “Part II—Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nMany of the statements in this “Outlook” section and in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” are forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the Company’s control.  Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  Further, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update them.  See “—Forward Looking Statements.”  For a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company’s results of operations or financial position, see “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors” and “Critical Accounting Estimates.”  \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations and to satisfy general corporate purposes when needed.\nOperating Company Liquidity.\n  The liquidity requirements of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are met primarily by funds generated from premiums, fees, income received on investments and investment maturities.  Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses.  The insurance subsidiaries’ liquidity requirements can be impacted by, among other factors, the timing and amount of catastrophe claims, which are inherently unpredictable, as well as the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries, which may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes.  Additionally, the variability of asbestos-related claim payments, as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation, may also result in increased liquidity requirements.  While an environment of higher interest rates during 2023 and 2024 resulted in significant net unrealized investment losses, the net unrealized loss is considered temporary in nature as it is not due to credit impairments, there is no impact on expected contractual cash flows from fixed maturities, and the Company generally holds its high-quality fixed maturity investments to maturity. In addition, given the temporary nature of net unrealized losses combined with the Company’s strong operating cash flows (which include income received on investments and the proceeds received upon maturity of the investments), the net unrealized investment loss is not expected to meaningfully impact the Company’s assessment of capital adequacy or liquidity.  It is the opinion of the Company’s management that the insurance subsidiaries’ future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the sources described above.  Subject to the restrictions imposed by states in which the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the Company’s principal insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to their respective parent companies, which, in turn, pay dividends to the corporate holding (parent) company (TRV).  For further information regarding restrictions on dividends paid by the Company’s insurance subsidiaries, see “Part I—Item 1—Business—Regulation.” \nHolding Company Liquidity\n.  TRV’s liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends, debt servicing, common share repurchases and, from time to time, contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan.  At December 31, 2024, TRV held total cash and short-term invested assets in the United States aggregating $1.80 billion and having a weighted average maturity of 22 days.  TRV has established a holding company liquidity target equal to its estimated annual pre-tax interest expense and common shareholder dividends (currently approximately $1.33 billion). TRV’s holding company liquidity of $1.80 billion at December 31, 2024 exceeded this target, and it is the opinion of the Company’s management that these assets are sufficient to meet TRV’s current liquidity requirements.\nTRV is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs.  The undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign operations are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the Company’s financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2024.  \nTRV has a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that expires on June 8, 2025 which permits it to issue securities from time to time.  TRV also has a $1.0 billion line of credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on June 15, 2027. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding.  TRV is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs. The Company has no senior notes or junior subordinated debentures maturing until April 2026, at which time $200 million of senior notes will mature.  \nThe Company utilized uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of $260 million to provide a portion of the capital needed to support its obligations at Lloyd’s at December 31, 2024.  If uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the Company can collateralize these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at Lloyd’s, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand.  \n93\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $9.07 billion and $7.71 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The increase in cash flows in 2024 primarily reflected the impacts of higher levels of cash received for premiums, partially offset by higher levels of payments for income taxes, claims and claim adjustment expenses, general and administrative expenses and commissions. The increase in cash paid for claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2024 was impacted by business growth and higher loss costs. The increase in cash received for premiums in 2024 compared to the prior year was impacted by business growth including the impact of positive renewal premium changes. \nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7.26 billion and $6.82 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The Company’s consolidated total investments at December 31, 2024 increased by $5.41 billion, or 6% over December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) net cash flows provided by operating activities, partially offset by (ii) net cash used in financing activities, (iii) higher net unrealized investment losses on investments due to the impact of higher interest rates during 2024 and (iv) the cost of acquiring Corvus.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations; accordingly, the portfolio is positioned to meet obligations to policyholders.  As such, the primary goals of the Company’s asset-liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows.  Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Company’s insurance reserves.  Although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the Company’s ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities.  \nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.75 billion and $1.05 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The totals in both 2024 and 2023 reflected common share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by the net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. The total in 2023 also included net proceeds from the issuance of debt.  Common share repurchases in 2024 and 2023 were $1.12 billion and $1.02 billion, respectively.\nDebt Transactions\n.\n2023. \nOn May 25, 2023, the Company issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.45% senior notes that will mature on May 25, 2053. The net proceeds of the issuance, after the deduction of the underwriting discount and expenses payable by the Company, totaled approximately $738 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 25 and November 25. Prior to November 25, 2052, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to but excluding November 25, 2052 on any senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury rate (as defined in the senior notes), plus 25 basis points. On or after November 25, 2052, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nDividends.\n  Dividends paid to shareholders were $951 million and $908 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company’s common stock will be at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Company’s financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.  Dividends will be paid by the Company only if declared by its Board of Directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the Company.  On January 22, 2025, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.05 per share, payable March 31, 2025, to shareholders of record on March 10, 2025. \nShare Repurchases.\n  The Company’s Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise.  The authorizations do not have a \n94\nstated expiration date.  The most recent authorization was approved by the Board of Directors on April 19, 2023 and added $5.0 billion of repurchase capacity to the $1.60 billion of capacity remaining at that date.  The Company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed net income.  The Company also expects that to the extent that it continues to grow premium volumes, the amount of capital returned to shareholders relative to earnings would be somewhat less than it otherwise would have been absent the growth in premium volumes.  The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels appropriate for the Company’s business operations, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company’s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws and other factors.  During 2024, the Company repurchased 4.4 million shares under its share repurchase authorizations, for a total of $1.00 billion. The average cost per share repurchased was $225.44. Common share repurchases in 2024 were higher than the total of $965 million in 2023.  The cost of treasury stock acquired pursuant to common share repurchases includes the 1% excise tax imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.  At December 31, 2024, the Company had $5.04 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorizations.  \nFrom the inception of the first authorization on May 2, 2006 through December 31, 2024, the Company has repurchased a cumulative total of 548.3 million shares for a total of $40.96 billion, or an average of $74.71 per share.  \nIn 2024 and 2023, the Company acquired 0.7 million and 0.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, from employees as treasury stock primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards, and shares used by employees to cover the exercise price, as well as the related payroll withholding taxes, with respect to certain stock options that were exercised.\nCapital Resources\nCapital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the Company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet its needs.  The following table summarizes the components of the Company’s capital structure at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n(at December 31, in millions)\n2024\n2023\nDebt:\n \n \nShort-term\n$\n100\n \n$\n100 \nLong-term\n8,004\n \n8,004 \nNet unamortized fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs\n(71)\n(73)\nTotal debt\n8,033\n \n8,031 \nShareholders’ equity:\n \n \nCommon stock and retained earnings, less treasury stock\n32,831\n \n29,392 \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n(4,967)\n(4,471)\nTotal shareholders’ equity\n27,864\n \n24,921 \nTotal capitalization\n$\n35,897\n \n$\n32,952 \nTotal capitalization at December 31, 2024 was $35.90 billion, $2.95 billion higher than at December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) net income of $5.00 billion and (ii) proceeds from the exercise of employee share options of $321 million, partially offset by (iii) common share repurchases totaling $1.00 billion under the Company’s share repurchase authorizations, (iv) shareholder dividends of $962 million and (v) an other comprehensive loss of $496 million, primarily reflecting an increase in net unrealized losses on investments due to a change in interest rates during 2024.\n95\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization presented in the foregoing table to total capitalization excluding net unrealized losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders’ equity:\n(at December 31, dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nTotal capitalization\n$\n35,897\n \n$\n32,952 \nLess: net unrealized losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders’ equity\n(3,640)\n(3,129)\nTotal capitalization excluding net unrealized losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders’ equity\n$\n39,537\n \n$\n36,081 \nDebt-to-total capital ratio\n22.4\n \n%\n24.4 \n%\nDebt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders’ equity\n20.3\n \n%\n22.3 \n%\nThe debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders’ equity, is calculated by dividing (a) debt by (b) total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders’ equity.  Net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be significantly impacted by both interest rate movements and other economic factors.  Accordingly, in the opinion of the Company’s management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to understand the Company’s financial leverage position.  The Company’s ratio of debt-to-total capital excluding after-tax net unrealized investment losses included in shareholders’ equity of 20.3% at December 31, 2024 was within the Company’s target range of 15% to 25%.\nCredit Agreement\n. The Company is a party to a five-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on June 15, 2027.  Terms of the credit agreement are discussed in more detail in note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nShelf Registration\n.  The Company has filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that expires on June 8, 2025 for the potential offering and sale of securities.  The Company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering.\nShare Repurchase Authorizations. \n At December 31, 2024, the Company had $5.04 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors.\nCash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations\nThe following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s estimated future payments under material contractual obligations and estimated claims and claim-related payments.  The table includes only obligations at December 31, 2024 that are expected to be settled in cash.\nThe table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim-related payments.  The amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates, generally utilizing actuarial projection techniques, at a given accounting date. These estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the Company’s assessment of facts and circumstances known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. Variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation or deflation, legal trends and legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Additionally, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. The future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount (including severity considerations) and timing. Amount and timing are frequently estimated separately. An estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim-related payments has unavoidable estimation uncertainty. \n96\nThe material cash requirements from contractual and other obligations at December 31, 2024 were as follows:\nPayments Due by Period (in millions)\nTotal\nLess than\n1 Year\n1-3\nYears\n3-5\nYears\nAfter 5\nYears\nDebt\n \n \n \n \n \nSenior notes\n$\n7,750\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n200\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7,550\n \nJunior subordinated debentures\n254\n \n—\n \n125\n \n—\n \n129\n \nTotal debt principal\n8,004\n \n—\n \n325\n \n—\n \n7,679\n \nInterest\n7,039\n \n389\n \n755\n \n728\n \n5,167\n \nTotal long-term debt obligations \n(1)\n15,043\n \n389\n \n1,080\n \n728\n \n12,846\n \nReal estate and other operating leases \n(2)\n358\n \n79\n \n129\n \n83\n \n67\n \nInformation systems-related commitments \n(3)\n915\n \n503\n \n378\n \n34\n \n—\n \nUnfunded investment commitments \n(4)\n1,490\n \n295\n \n463\n \n509\n \n223\n \nEstimated claims and claim-related payments\n \n \n \n \n \nClaims and claim adjustment expenses \n(5)\n62,537\n \n15,045\n \n15,888\n \n8,516\n \n23,088\n \nClaims from large deductible policies \n(6)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal estimated claims and claim-related payments\n62,537\n \n15,045\n \n15,888\n \n8,516\n \n23,088\n \nTotal\n$\n80,343\n \n$\n16,311\n \n$\n17,938\n \n$\n9,870\n \n$\n36,224\n \n________________________________________\n(1)\nSee note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of outstanding indebtedness. Because the amounts reported in the foregoing table include principal and interest, the total long-term debt obligations will not agree with the amounts reported in note 9.\n(2)\nRepresents agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business to lease office space, equipment and furniture.  \n(3)\nIncludes agreements with vendors to purchase system software (including software as a service), software maintenance services and technology-related costs.\n(4)\nRepresents estimated timing for fulfilling unfunded commitments for private equity limited partnerships, real estate partnerships and other investments.\n(5)\nThe amounts in “Claims and claim adjustment expenses” in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses, gross of reinsurance recoverables, excluding structured settlements expected to be paid by annuity companies.  \nThe Company has entered into reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to losses and protect its capital as described in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn order to qualify for reinsurance accounting, a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk.  Since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities (the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses) relating to the underlying reinsured contracts.  The presence of any feature that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance.  The assumptions used in estimating the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities.\nThe estimated future cash inflows from the Company’s reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows:\n(in millions)\nTotal\nLess than 1\nYear\n1-3\nYears\n3-5\nYears\nAfter 5\nYears\nReinsurance recoverables\n$\n5,090\n \n$\n927\n \n$\n1,034\n \n$\n610\n \n$\n2,519\n \n97\nThe Company manages its business and evaluates its liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses on a net of reinsurance basis.  The estimated cash flows on a net of reinsurance basis are as follows:\n(in millions)\nTotal\nLess than 1\nYear\n1-3\nYears\n3-5\nYears\nAfter 5\nYears\nClaims and claim adjustment expenses, net\n$\n57,447\n \n$\n14,118\n \n$\n14,854\n \n$\n7,906\n \n$\n20,569\n \nFor business underwritten by non-U.S. operations, future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on December 31, 2024.\nThe amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly, the amounts above will differ from the Company’s balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted in the balance sheet. See note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n(6)    Workers’ compensation large deductible policies provide third-party coverage in which the Company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. “Claims from large deductible policies” represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. The liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as “contractholder payables” and “contractholder receivables,” respectively. Most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder’s escrow, which is periodically replenished by the policyholder. The payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within “Claims and claim adjustment expenses” in the above table. Because the timing of the collection of the deductible (contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table.\nThe estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables (net of allowance for expected credit losses) for workers’ compensation policies is presented below:\n(in millions)\nTotal\nLess than 1\nYear\n1-3\nYears\n3-5\nYears\nAfter 5\nYears\nContractholder payables/receivables\n$\n3,171\n \n$\n1,023\n \n$\n967\n \n$\n416\n \n$\n765\n \nThe above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of default by the company issuing the annuity. The Company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements.  In addition, the Company is not currently subject to any minimum funding requirements for its qualified pension plan.  Accordingly, future contributions are not included in the foregoing table. \nThe Company believes that the combination of operating company liquidity, holding company liquidity, its investment portfolio and its capital resources are sufficient to meet its contractual obligations. \nDividend Availability\nThe Company’s principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the State of Connecticut.  The insurance holding company laws of Connecticut applicable to the Company’s subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurer’s statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurer’s net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. This declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.  The insurance holding company laws of other states in which the Company’s subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends.  A maximum of $4.17 billion is available by the end of 2025 for such dividends to ultimately be paid to the holding company, TRV, without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department.  The Company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2025 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2025, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the Connecticut Insurance Department prior to payment.  \nIn addition to the regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends that can be paid by the Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid to the Company’s shareholders is also limited, to a lesser degree, by certain covenants contained in its line of credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that require the \n98\nCompany to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth as described in note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nTRV is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs.  The undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign operations are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the Company’s financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2024.  \nThe U.S. insurance subsidiaries paid dividends of $2.00 billion and $1.17 billion during 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the qualified domestic pension plan), which covers substantially all U.S. domestic employees and provides benefits primarily under a cash balance formula.  In addition, the Company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which covers certain highly-compensated employees, pension plans for employees of its foreign subsidiaries, and a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees satisfying certain age and service requirements and for certain retirees.\nThe qualified domestic pension plan is subject to regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA), which requires plans to meet minimum standards of funding and requires such plans to subscribe to plan termination insurance through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The Company does not have a minimum funding requirement for the qualified domestic pension plan for 2025 and does not anticipate having a minimum funding requirement in 2026.  The Company has significant discretion in making contributions above those necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, there was no minimum funding requirement for the qualified domestic pension plan.  In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company made no voluntary contributions to the qualified domestic pension plan.  The qualified domestic pension plan had a funded status of 130% and 120% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Based on its funded status at December 31, 2024, the Company does not currently anticipate making a voluntary contribution to the qualified domestic pension plan in 2025.  In determining future contributions, the Company will consider the performance of the plan’s investment portfolio, the effects of interest rates on the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the Company’s other capital requirements.\nThe qualified domestic pension plan assets are managed to maximize long-term total return while maintaining an appropriate level of risk. The Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. The current target allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities.  For 2025, the Company plans to apply an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00%, comparable with 2024.  The expected rate of return reflects the Company’s current expectations with regard to long-term returns in the capital markets, taking into account the pension plan’s asset allocation targets, the historical performance and current valuation of U.S. and international equities, and the level of long term interest rate and inflation expectations.\nFor further discussion of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nRisk-Based Capital\nThe NAIC has an RBC requirement for most property and casualty insurance companies, which determines minimum capital requirements and is intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations.  The Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to these NAIC RBC requirements based on laws that have been adopted by individual states.  These requirements subject insurers having policyholders’ surplus less than that required by the RBC calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy.  Each of the Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries had policyholders’ surplus at December 31, 2024 significantly above the level at which any RBC regulatory action would occur.  Regulators in the jurisdictions in which the Company’s foreign insurance subsidiaries are located require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on, among other things, the type and amount of insurance policies written.  Each of the Company’s foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital significantly above their respective regulatory requirements at December 31, 2024.\n99\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to selling businesses to third parties, certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications.  See note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  The Company does not believe it is reasonably likely that these arrangements will have a material current or future effect on the Company’s financial position, changes in financial position, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables, and impairments of investments, goodwill and other intangible assets.\nClaims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\nGross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in millions)\nCase\nIBNR\nTotal\nCase\nIBNR\nTotal\nGeneral liability\n$\n5,845\n \n$\n11,349\n \n$\n17,194\n \n$\n5,658 \n$\n10,214 \n$\n15,872 \nCommercial property\n1,384\n \n342\n \n1,726\n \n1,447 \n281 \n1,728 \nCommercial multi-peril\n3,015\n \n3,438\n \n6,453\n \n2,869 \n2,905 \n5,774 \nCommercial automobile\n2,749\n \n3,195\n \n5,944\n \n2,661 \n2,773 \n5,434 \nWorkers’ compensation\n9,980\n \n8,749\n \n18,729\n \n10,004 \n9,203 \n19,207 \nFidelity and surety\n210\n \n571\n \n781\n \n265 \n466 \n731 \nPersonal automobile\n2,315\n \n2,588\n \n4,903\n \n2,245 \n2,460 \n4,705 \nPersonal homeowners and other\n1,238\n \n1,833\n \n3,071\n \n1,217 \n2,004 \n3,221 \nInternational and other\n2,561\n \n2,726\n \n5,287\n \n2,620 \n2,329 \n4,949 \nProperty-casualty\n29,297\n \n34,791\n \n64,088\n \n28,986 \n32,635 \n61,621 \nAccident and health\n5\n \n—\n \n5\n \n6 \n— \n6 \nClaims and claim adjustment expense reserves\n$\n29,302\n \n$\n34,791\n \n$\n64,093\n \n$\n28,992 \n$\n32,635 \n$\n61,627 \nThe $2.47 billion increase in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since December 31, 2023 primarily reflected the impacts of (i) catastrophe losses in 2024, (ii) higher volumes of insured exposures and (iii) loss cost trends for the current accident year, partially offset by (iv) claim payments made during 2024 and (v) net favorable prior year reserve development.\nAsbestos and environmental reserves are included in the General liability, Commercial multi-peril and International and other lines in the foregoing summary table. Asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately; see “Asbestos Claims and Litigation,” “Environmental Claims and Litigation” and “Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves” herein.\nClaims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management’s estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) as of the balance sheet date.  Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent management estimates, primarily utilizing actuarial expertise and projection methods.  These estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future, based on the Company’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. In establishing gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, the Company also considers salvage and subrogation. Estimated recoveries from reinsurance are included in “Reinsurance Recoverables” as an asset on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.  The claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the Company.\nThe process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, economic inflation, changes in the tort environment, legal trends and legislative changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims \n100\nand claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses.  The Company refines its estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. The Company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying these estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, may be materially different than the amount currently recorded-favorable or unfavorable. Because establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates and the application of judgment, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may change. The Company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.\nThere are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes.  For example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and other catastrophic events can be affected by the inability of the Company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties, including the interpretation of policy terms and conditions, and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves.  Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility.  The timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the Company in estimating reserves for that reporting period.  The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.\nA portion of the Company’s gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling $2.11 billion at December 31, 2024) are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. While the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs’ expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the Company’s management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current insurance reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company’s future operating results. See the preceding discussion of “Asbestos Claims and Litigation” and “Environmental Claims and Litigation.”\nGeneral Discussion\nThe process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. Data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities. Such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. The process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information. \nMultiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. Each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. Therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change with each evaluation. The estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated. \nIn most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. This will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability. The Company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves by reporting segments are reasonable, given available information. Reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews.  These reviews may substantiate the validity of management’s recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate.  \nThe exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. \n101\nAs a result, the Company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. In addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process. \nProperty-casualty insurance policies are either written on a “claims-made” or on an “occurrence” basis.  Claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements in individual policies, claims reported during the policy period.  Policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss many years later.\nMost general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. These policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance. The occurrence form, which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability, including construction defect. Occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of loss trends, which can be influenced by a number of factors, including future inflation, judicial interpretations and societal litigation trends (e.g., size of jury awards and propensity of individuals to pursue litigation), among others.\nA basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below. To the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is estimated to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if available and when appropriate, external data. Such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated.  Significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process.  In addition, the introduction of new products creates a unique risk as historical company data would typically not be available. \nInformed judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. This includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. In addition to actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers, as well as other company management. Therefore, management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. It is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger, consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult.\nThe variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line. \nProduct lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims. Short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. The longer the time to final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty. \nA major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. The reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes estimating IBNR inherently more uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of IBNR to the total claim liability for the product line. Writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years’ worth of IBNR claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses for such products. The most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims. \nFor some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. These lines are generally referred to as being “low frequency/high severity,” while lines without this “large claim” sensitivity are referred to as “high frequency/low severity.”  Estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large claims.  As a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. In contrast, for high frequency/low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is likely narrower and more stable. \nClaim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. Product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater estimation uncertainty. \n102\nActuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. The human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. Different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas of focus. Hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other.\nLastly, significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. Events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within the new organization. \nRisk Factors\nThe major causes of material uncertainty (“risk factors”) generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line.  In a few cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method, but in most cases, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. Actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently.\nSome risk factors will affect more than one product line. Examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in the tort environment, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants, medical utilization and degree of claimant fraud. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line. Individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components. \nThe effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. For example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors. \nThe evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. For example, the timing of claims payments in one geographic region may be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region. \nWhile some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more evolutionary. Evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in stepwise fashion. The final impact is not known until all steps have occurred. \nSudden changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact. Evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable. \nActuarial Methods for Analyzing and Estimating Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\nThe principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the Company’s actuaries to evaluate management’s existing estimates for prior accident periods are the paid loss development method, the case incurred development method, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson (BF) method, and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method.  The BF method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible.  These estimation and analysis methods are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods.  (See note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of these methods).  \nWhile the Company utilizes these conventional actuarial methods to estimate the claims liability for its various businesses, Company actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line may select from the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession.  The Company’s actuaries are also regularly monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates.\nSome components of a product line may be susceptible to infrequent large claims or not be subject to conventional methods. In such cases, the Company’s actuarial analysis will isolate such components for review.  The reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the conventional methods described above.  The reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods, such as:\n103\n•\nEstimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods, adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available.\n•\nUtilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims, combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates.  (This monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates).\n•\nUtilizing historic longer-term average ratios of large claims to small claims, and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims from conventional analysis.\n•\nGround-up analysis of the underlying exposure (typically used for asbestos and environmental).  \nThe results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests, including implied incurred-loss-to-earned-premium ratios, non-zero claim severity trends and paid-to-incurred loss ratios.  An actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss development to expected development embedded within management’s estimate.  Additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of other actuarial methods.\nThe methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management’s estimate for prior accident periods.  For the initial estimate of the current accident year, however, the available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication.  As a result, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on an exposure-based method using either the loss ratio projection method or the expected loss method.  The loss ratio projection method, which is typically used for guaranteed-cost business, develops an initial estimate for an accident year by multiplying earned premiums for the accident year by a projected loss ratio.  The projected loss ratio is determined by analyzing prior period experience, and adjusting for loss cost trends, rate level differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years.  The exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component, based on the stability and consistency of the individual accident year estimates.  The expected loss method, which is typically used for loss sensitive business, develops an initial estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses for an accident year by analyzing exposures by account.\nManagement’s Estimates\nAt least once per quarter, members of Company management meet with the Company’s actuaries to review the latest claims and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses. Based on these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed from the prior period. In doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. For example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. The resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability. \nThis type of assessment requires considerable judgment. It is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. Even if a change is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. The overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to perform as the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated, which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. It may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the Company’s estimated claim liabilities. The final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new actionable information. \nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the process by which the Company establishes reserves for the purpose of the Company’s financial statements.\nDiscussion of Product Lines\nThe following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. There are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs. Each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. Also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. For example, in workers’ compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs. Thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation. \n104\nIn order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line, the historical changes in year-end claims and claim adjustment expense reserves over a one-year period are provided for the U.S. product lines.  This information is provided for both the Company and the industry for the nine most recent years, and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the reported line(s) that most closely match the individual product line being discussed.  These changes were calculated, net of reinsurance, from statutory annual statement data found in Schedule P of those statements, and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years combined, excluding non-defense related claim adjustment expense.  Data presented for the Company includes history for the entire Travelers group (U.S. companies only), as required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for Schedule P.  Comparable data for non-U.S. companies is not available.  \nGeneral Liability\nGeneral liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year. The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the characteristics of claims, including specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self-insured retentions, among others. There are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. Some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within five to seven years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g., a reporting lag of a decade or more for “construction defect” claims). \nWhile the majority of general liability coverages are written on an “occurrence” basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering management and professional liability, including cyber coverages) are typically insured on a “claims-made” basis. \nGeneral liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage. Bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder’s legal obligation arising from non-intentional acts such as negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. In some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical treatment costs. Property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant’s private property arising from the policyholder’s legal obligation for non-intentional acts. In most cases, property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter. \nIn addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately.  These exposures include asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis. These unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on conventional actuarial methods. \nDefense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. For some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs is included in the policy limit available to pay the claim. Such “defense within the limits” policies are most common for “claims-made” products. When defense costs are outside of the policy limits, the full amount of the policy limit is available to pay claims and the amounts paid for defense costs have no contractual limit.   \nThis line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the United States (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). Major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e., the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action, whether the “event” triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the individual claim actions), whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the potential for mass claim actions.  Claims with longer reporting lags result in greater estimation uncertainty.  This is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). Claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag (i.e., the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure). \nThe amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. The components in this product line with the longest latency, longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental. Components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity issues, but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect and other mass tort actions. Many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially \n105\nless uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. In general, components with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than components without those characteristics. \nIn addition to the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section, the company utilizes various report year development methods for the construction defect components of this product line.  The Construction Defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for IBNR claim counts.  For components with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, the Company relies more heavily on the BF method than on the paid and case incurred development methods.   \nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \nGeneral liability risk factors\n \n•\nChanges in claim handling philosophies \n•\nChanges in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions \n•\nNew or expanded theories of liability \n•\nTrends in jury awards \n•\nChanges in the propensity to sue, in general with specificity to particular issues \n•\nChanges in the propensity to litigate rather than settle a claim\n•\nIncreases in attorney involvement in, or impact on, claims\n•\nChanges in statutes of limitations \n•\nChanges in the underlying court system \n•\nDistortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues \n•\nChanges in tort law \n•\nShifts in lawsuit mix between federal and state courts \n•\nChanges in claim adjuster processes or reporting which may cause distortions in the data being analyzed \n•\nThe impact of inflation on loss costs\n•\nChanges in settlement patterns \nGeneral liability book of business risk factors\n \n•\nChanges in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) \n•\nChanges in underwriting standards \n•\nProduct mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) \nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.5% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from -4% to 6% (averaging 1%) for the Company, and from -2% to 3% (averaging 1%) for the industry overall.  The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year.  The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.  General liability reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 24% of the Company’s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.  \nThe Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line related to the last nine accident years, which excludes the impacts of increases in asbestos and environmental reserves, the extension of the statute of limitations for childhood sexual molestation claims and increases in reserves in the Company’s runoff operations, was 4% for 2024, 4% for 2023 and 2% for 2022. The 2024 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience in Business Insurance for accident years 2021 through 2023. The 2023 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience in Business Insurance for accident years 2017 through 2020. The 2022 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience in Business Insurance for accident years 2017 through 2019.  \n106\nCommercial Property\nCommercial property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). It is generally viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line, except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. The claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims. \nCommercial property reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. Examples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \nCommercial property risk factors\n \n•\nPhysical concentration of policyholders \n•\nAvailability and cost of local contractors \n•\nInflation and materials shortages\n•\nFor the more severe catastrophic events, “demand surge” inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services \n•\nLocal building codes \n•\nAmount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims) \n•\nFrequency of claim re-openings on claims previously closed\n•\nCourt interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, wind versus flooding or communicable disease exclusions) \n•\nLags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment on roofs) \n•\nCourt or legislative changes to the statute of limitations \n•\nWeather/climate variability\nCommercial property book of business risk factors\n \n•\nPolicy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements) \n•\nChanges in underwriting standards\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves.  As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -11% to 2% (averaging -7%) for the Company, and from -10% to -2% (averaging -6%) for the industry overall.  The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year.  The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.  Commercial property reserves represent approximately 3% of the Company’s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nSince commercial property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for commercial property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines.  This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for commercial property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines.  This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to commercial property because weather-related events that occur in the second half of the year may not be completely resolved until the following year.  Reserve estimates associated with catastrophes may take even longer to resolve.  The reserve estimates for this product line are also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for significant catastrophes such as hurricanes, tornadoes, hail storms and wildfires.  \nThe Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line was -3% for 2024, 2% for 2023 and -8% for 2022. The 2024 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience related to both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2018 through 2020 and 2023. The 2023 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience related to both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses for accident year 2022. The 2022 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience related to both catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2020 and 2021. \n107\nCommercial Multi-Peril\nCommercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. For property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability coverages, it takes a longer period of time to close claims. \nThe reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or other large single loss events. The reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. Commercial multi-peril is generally sold to small- to mid-sized accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and commercial property includes larger customers. \nSee “Commercial property risk factors” and “General liability risk factors,” discussed above, with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril. \nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves.  As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial multi-peril (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.4% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from -5% to 4% (averaging 0%) for the Company, and from -3% to 3% (averaging 0%) for the industry overall.  The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year.  The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.  Commercial multi-peril reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental reserves) represent approximately 10% of the Company’s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nAs discussed above, this line combines general liability and commercial property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines.\nThe Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line related to the last nine accident years, which excludes the impacts of increases in asbestos and environmental reserves and increases in reserves in the Company’s runoff operations, was 1% for 2024, 0% for 2023 and -2% for 2022. The 2024 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2021 through 2023.  In 2023, higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident year 2022 was mostly offset by better than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2017 and 2020.  The 2022 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for property coverages for accident year 2021. \nCommercial Automobile\nThe commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. In general, claim reporting lags are generally short, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high frequency, low to moderate severity. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.  Recently, the Company has seen more of an increase in the rate of attorney involvement than it had anticipated and a lengthening of the claim development pattern.  As a consequence, the Company has experienced a higher level of bodily injury severity than it had anticipated.   \nCommercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components: bodily injury liability; property damage liability; collision claims; and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented. \nThe Company utilizes the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion above in estimating claim liabilities for this line.  This is supplemented with detailed custom analyses where needed.\n108\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \nBodily injury and property damage liability risk factors\n \n•\nTrends in jury awards \n•\nChanges in the underlying court system \n•\nChanges in case law \n•\nLitigation trends\n•\nIncreases in attorney involvement in, or impact on, claims\n•\nFrequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits \n•\nChange in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents, including the impact of inflation \n•\nChanges in auto safety technology\n•\nSubrogation opportunities \n•\nChanges in claim handling philosophies \n•\nFrequency of visits to health providers \n•\nNumber of medical procedures given during visits to health providers \n•\nTypes of health providers used \n•\nTypes of medical treatments received \n•\nChanges in cost of medical treatments \n•\nDegree of patient responsiveness to treatment \nCommercial automobile book of business risk factors\n \n•\nChanges in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) \n•\nChanges in mix of insured vehicles (e.g., long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles, fleet risks versus non-fleets) \n•\nChanges in underwriting standards \nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves.  As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.  \nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -2% to 11% (averaging 3%) for the Company, and from 2% to 7% (averaging 5%) for the industry overall.  The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year.  The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.  Commercial automobile reserves represent approximately 9% of the Company’s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nThe Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line was 0% for 2024, 4% for 2023 and 0% for 2022. In 2024, better than expected loss experience for physical damage coverages for accident year 2023 was largely offset by higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2021 through 2023. The 2023 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2021 and 2022. In 2022, higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2017 through 2019 and 2021 was largely offset by better than expected loss experience for physical damage coverages for accident year 2021 and for liability coverages for accident year 2020. \nWorkers’ Compensation\nWorkers’ compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year. While certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course of several years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. In addition, some payments can run as long as the injured worker’s life, such as permanent disability benefits and on-going medical care. Despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, payment obligations are generally not complex, and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity. The largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker’s injury, as such claims are subject to greater inflation risk.  Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk.  \nWorkers’ compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses. \n109\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required workers’ compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \nIndemnity risk factors\n \n•\nTime required to recover from the injury \n•\nDegree of available transitional jobs \n•\nDegree of legal involvement \n•\nChanges in the interpretations and processes of the administrative bodies that oversee workers’ compensation claims \n•\nFuture wage inflation for states that index benefits \n•\nChanges in the administrative policies of second injury funds \nMedical risk factors\n \n•\nChanges in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules (“inflation”)\n•\nAvailability of medical providers and medical wage impacts \n•\nFrequency of visits to health providers \n•\nNumber of medical procedures given during visits to health providers \n•\nTypes of health providers used \n•\nType of medical treatments received \n•\nUse of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices \n•\nAvailability of new medical processes and equipment \n•\nChanges in the use of pharmaceutical drugs, including drugs for pain management \n•\nDegree of patient responsiveness to treatment \nGeneral workers’ compensation risk factors\n \n•\nFrequency of reopening claims previously closed \n•\nMortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment \n•\nChanges in statutory benefits, including due to presumption laws\n•\nThe impact, if any, of potential future changes to government health insurance legislation\nWorkers’ compensation book of business risk factors\n \n•\nProduct mix \n•\nInjury type mix \n•\nChanges in underwriting standards \nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves.  As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for workers’ compensation, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -5% to -2% (averaging -4%) for the Company, and from -5% to -2% (averaging -4%) for the industry overall.  The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year.  The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.  Workers’ compensation reserves represent approximately 29% of the Company’s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nThe Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line was -5% for 2024, -5% for 2023 and -4% for 2022. The 2024 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2022 and prior.  The 2023 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2021 and prior. The 2022 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2021 and prior. \nFidelity and Surety\nFidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. It takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle most fidelity claims. The volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insured’s business operations, amount of policy limit and attachment point of coverage. The uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. The high frequency, low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates, whereas the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of ultimate loss outcomes. Actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity claims.\n110\nSurety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project(s) or commercial transaction being bonded. The frequency of losses in surety generally has a lagging correlation with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of an insured to fulfill its contractual obligations.  The Company actively seeks to mitigate this exposure to loss through disciplined risk selection, adherence to underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring of contractor progress in significant construction projects.  The volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the bonded party, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the surety company to mitigate losses, such as unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other security positions of a bonded party’s assets. Certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in nature. These can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. Other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by the bonded party and due to the surety company (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts), the results of financial restructuring of a bonded party and the availability and cost of replacement contractors, labor and materials.\nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required fidelity and surety reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \nFidelity risk factors\n \n•\nType of business of insured \n•\nPolicy limit and attachment points \n•\nThird-party claims \n•\nCoverage litigation \n•\nComplexity of claims \n•\nGrowth in insureds’ operations \nSurety risk factors\n \n•\nEconomic trends, including the general level of construction activity \n•\nConcentration of reserves in a relatively few large claims \n•\nType of business bonded \n•\nType of obligation bonded \n•\nCumulative limits of liability for the bonded party\n•\nAssets available to mitigate loss \n•\nDefective workmanship/latent defects \n•\nFinancial strategy of the bonded party \n•\nChanges in statutory obligations \n•\nGeographic spread of business \nFidelity and Surety book of business risk factors\n•\nChanges in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, limits, endorsements) \n•\nChanges in underwriting standards \nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves.  As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for fidelity and surety, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.7% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -36% to -10% (averaging -20%) for the Company, and from -21% to 0% (averaging -13%) for the industry overall.  The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year.  The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.  Fidelity and surety reserves represent approximately 1% of the Company’s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nIn general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) are a primary source of changes in reserve estimates for this product line.\nThe Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line was -14% for 2024, -26% for 2023 and -30% for 2022. The 2024 change primarily reflected higher than expected loss experience in the fidelity and surety product line for accident year 2022. The 2023 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in the fidelity and surety product line for accident years 2021 and 2022. The 2022 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in the fidelity and surety product line for accident years 2015 through 2019 and 2021.\n111\nPersonal Automobile\nPersonal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. Reporting lags are relatively short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. It is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to moderate severity product line.  Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk. \nPersonal automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims. These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented.  \nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve discussion section) include: \nBodily injury, property damage liability and no-fault risk factors\n \n•\nTrends in jury awards \n•\nChanges in the underlying court system and its philosophy \n•\nChanges in case law \n•\nLitigation trends\n•\nIncreases in attorney involvement in, or impact on, claims\n•\nFrequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits \n•\nChange in frequency trends, including the impact of changes in driving behavior and customer coverage elections\n•\nChange in average severity of accidents, or proportion of severe accidents, including the impact of inflation, changes in driving behavior and the involvement of pedestrians  \n•\nChanges in auto technology, including safety features  \n•\nSubrogation opportunities \n•\nFrequency of visits to health providers\n•\nNumber of medical procedures given during visits to health providers \n•\nTypes of health providers used \n•\nTypes of medical treatments received \n•\nChanges in cost of medical treatments \n•\nEffectiveness of no-fault laws \n•\nDegree of patient responsiveness to treatment \n•\nChanges in claim handling philosophies \nPersonal automobile book of business risk factors\n \n•\nChanges in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) \n•\nChanges in underwriting standards \n•\nChanges in the use of permissible data for rating and underwriting\nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves.  As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for personal automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from -5% to 3% (averaging -1%) for the Company, and from -2% to 4% (averaging 1%) for the industry overall.  The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year.  The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.  Personal automobile reserves represent approximately 8% of the Company’s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nThe Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line was -5% for 2024, 0% for 2023 and 0% for 2022. The 2024 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2020 through 2023 and for physical damage coverages for accident year 2023. In 2023, better than expected loss experience for physical damage coverages for accident years 2021 and 2022 was largely offset by higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2020 and 2021.  In 2022,  higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident year 2021 was largely offset by better than expected loss experience for physical damage coverages for accident year 2021 and for liability coverages for accident years 2018 through 2020.\n112\nPersonal Homeowners and Other\nHomeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. Most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the claim reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of several months are not unusual.  The resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist. \nThe liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags.  Personal Insurance Other products include personal umbrella policies, among others.  See “general liability reserving risk factors,” discussed above, for reserving risk factors related to umbrella coverages.\nOverall, the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity. \nHomeowners reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe losses. \nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include: \nHomeowners and Other risk factors\n \n•\nWeather/climate variability\n•\nInflation and materials costs and shortages\n•\nFor the more severe catastrophic events, “demand surge” inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services \n•\nAmount of time to return property to residential use \n•\nLags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment on roofs) \n•\nAvailability and cost of local contractors \n•\nQuality of construction of insured homes\n•\nLocal building codes \n•\nLitigation trends \n•\nTrends in jury awards \n•\nCourt interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding) \n•\nCourt or legislative changes to the statute of limitations \n•\nSalvage and subrogation opportunities \nHomeowners and Other book of business risk factors\n \n•\nPolicy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.) \n•\nDegree of concentration of policyholders \n•\nChanges in underwriting standards\n•\nChanges in the use of permissible data for rating and underwriting \nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves.  As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for personal homeowners and other, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nHistorically, the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line (excluding Personal Insurance Other, which for statutory reporting purposes is included with other lines of business) over the last nine years has varied from -28% to 3% (averaging -7%) for the Company, and from -3% to 2% (averaging -1%) for the industry overall.  The Company’s year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year.  The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line.  Personal homeowners and other reserves represent approximately 5% of the Company’s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nThis line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves relate to property.  While property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines.  This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines.  This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because \n113\nweather-related events in the second half of the year may not be completely resolved until the following year.  Reserve estimates associated with catastrophes, including wildfires in recent years, may take even longer to resolve.  \nThe Company’s change in reserve estimate for this product line (excluding Personal Insurance Other) was -12% for 2024, -9% for 2023 and -2% for 2022. The 2024 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2017 through 2023. The 2023 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2017 through 2022.  The 2022 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2018 through 2020. \nInternational and Other\nInternational and other includes products written by the Company’s international operations, as well as all other products not explicitly discussed above. The principal component of “other” claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess-of-loss basis, which may include reinsurance of non-U.S. exposures, and is runoff business.\nInternational and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. The common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the U.S. statutory reporting framework. \nDue to changes in the business mix for this product line over time, incurred claim liabilities for more recent years are generally shorter-tailed (due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved, e.g., Canada, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom), compared to the older liabilities from runoff operations that are extremely long tail (e.g., U.S. excess liabilities reinsured through the London market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the distribution system (e.g., underwriting pool versus direct) and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g., insured and insurer located in different countries). In particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity, due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co-insurers through a broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes.\nInternational reserves are generally analyzed by country and general coverage category (e.g., General Liability in Canada, Commercial Property in the United Kingdom, etc.). The business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage. Where the underlying insured hazard is outside the United States, the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the Homeowners, Personal Automobile, Commercial Automobile, General Liability, Commercial Property and Surety discussions above, taking into account differences in the legal environment and differences in terms and conditions. However, statutory coverage differences exist amongst various jurisdictions.  For example, in some jurisdictions there are no aggregate policy limits on certain liability coverages.\nOther reserves, primarily assumed reinsurance in runoff, are generally analyzed by program/pool, treaty type, and general coverage category (e.g., General Liability — excess of loss reinsurance). Excess exposure requires the insured to “prove” not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policy’s attachment point.  \nExamples of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required International and other reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section, and in the Personal Automobile, Homeowners, General Liability, Commercial Property, Commercial Automobile and Surety discussions above) include: \nInternational and other risk factors\n \n•\nChanges in claim handling procedures, including those of the primary carriers \n•\nChanges in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision \n•\nEconomic trends\n•\nNew theories of liability \n•\nTrends in jury awards \n•\nChanges in the propensity to sue \n•\nChanges in statutes of limitations \n•\nChanges in the underlying court system \n•\nDistortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues \n•\nChanges in tort law \n•\nChanges in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data) \n•\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates\n114\nInternational and other book of business risk factors\n \n•\nChanges in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, “claims-made” language) \n•\nChanges in underwriting standards \n•\nProduct mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix) \nUnanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves.  As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for International and other (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.4% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.  International and other reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 8% of the Company’s total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.  \nInternational and other represents a combination of different product lines, some of which are in runoff.  Comparative historical information is not available for international product lines as insurers domiciled outside of the United States do not file U.S. statutory reports. Comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible one-year changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business.  Accordingly, the Company has not included comparative analyses for International and other. \nReinsurance Recoverables\nAmounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. The Company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies.  In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the Company’s rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The Company employs dedicated specialists and comprehensive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes. \nThe Company has entered into a reinsurance contract in connection with catastrophe bonds issued by Long Point Re IV.  This contract meets the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts.  The catastrophe bonds are described in more detail in “Item 1-Business-Catastrophe Reinsurance.” \nRecoverables attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims, of which workers’ compensation claims comprise a significant portion, for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities.  Recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate primarily to workers’ compensation service business.  These recoverables are supported by the participating insurance companies’ obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company’s voluntary market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant.  In the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool’s or association’s obligations, the other members’ share of such obligation increases proportionally.  \nThe Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance. The allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors.  For structured settlements, the allowance is also based upon the Company’s ongoing review of life insurers’ creditworthiness and estimated amounts of coverage that would be available from state guaranty funds if a life insurer defaults. A probability-of-default methodology which reflects current and forecasted economic conditions is used to estimate the amount of uncollectible reinsurance due to credit-related factors and the estimate is reported in an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance. The allowance also includes estimated uncollectible amounts related to dispute risk with reinsurers.  Amounts deemed to be uncollectible, including amounts due from known insolvent reinsurers, are written off against the allowance. Changes in the allowance, as well as any subsequent collections of amounts previously written off, are reported as part of claims and claim adjustment expenses.  The Company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies.\nImpairments\nInvestment Impairments\nSee note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of investment impairments. \nDue to the subjective nature of the Company’s analysis and estimates of future cash flows, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that the Company could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security \n115\nif it had access to additional information about the issuer.  Additionally, it is possible that the issuer’s actual ability to meet contractual obligations may be different than what the Company determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods.  \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets Impairments\nThe Company performs a review, on at least an annual basis, of goodwill held by the reporting units which are the Company’s three operating and reportable segments: Business Insurance; Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Personal Insurance. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its reporting units that incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations, including assumptions that market participants may make in valuing the reporting unit. The discounted cash flow model is an income approach to valuation that is based on a detailed cash flow analysis for deriving a current fair value of reporting units and is representative of the Company’s reporting units’ current and expected future financial performance. The assumptions used include earnings projections, including projected growth, projected levels of economic capital needed to support the business, and the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting the projected cash flows. Changes in the estimates of projected earnings, business growth, economic capital, and the weighted average cost of capital will directly impact the estimated fair value of the reporting units and, depending on the directional change of inputs, may increase the risk of impairment of goodwill. Once the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units, those estimates are compared to their carrying values. If the carrying values of the reporting units were to exceed their fair value, the amount of the impairment would be calculated, and goodwill adjusted accordingly.\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets held by the Company are also reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis. The Company uses various methods for estimating the fair value of the intangible assets and relies on inputs such as replacement cost, projected earnings, including projected growth of earnings, and market royalty rates applied to the projected earnings\n.\nSee note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nOTHER UNCERTAINTIES\nFor a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company’s results of operations or financial position, see note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and “Item 1A—Risk Factors.” \nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains, and management may make, certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
