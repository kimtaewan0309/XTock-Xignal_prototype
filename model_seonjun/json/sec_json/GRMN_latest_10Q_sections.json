Management’s Discussion and Analysis o\nf Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nThe discussion set forth below, as well as other portions of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, contain statements concerning potential future events. Such forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions by management, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including assumptions about risks and uncertainties faced by the Company. Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such words as \"future\", \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", “estimates”, “would”, “could”, “can”, “may,” or other similar words or other comparable terms. If any of the Company’s assumptions prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, actual results could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including, but not limited to, those factors identified in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2024. Readers are strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any forward-looking statement concerning the Company. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and the Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect future events or developments, except as required by law.\n \nThe information contained in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and notes thereto in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2024. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to \"we\", \"us\", \"our\", the \"Company\" and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.\n \nUnless otherwise indicated, amounts set forth in the discussion below are in thousands.\n \nCompany Overview\n \nThe Company is a leading worldwide provider of wireless devices, many of which feature location technology such as Global Positioning System (GPS), and applications that are designed for people who live an active lifestyle. We are organized in the five operating segments of fitness, outdoor, aviation, marine, and auto OEM, which represent the primary markets served by the Company. We design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute a diverse family of GPS-enabled products and other navigation, communications, sensor-based and information products for these markets, as well as products installed by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and for aftermarket applications. Our products are sold through a variety of indirect distribution channels, including a large worldwide network of independent retailers, dealers, distributors, installation and repair shops, and OEMs. We also sell our products and services directly through our online webshop (garmin.com), subscriptions for connected services, and our own retail stores.\n \nBusiness Environment Update\n \nGlobal economic and geopolitical conditions impact our operations and financial results, although we believe our vertically integrated and diversified business model enables us to be resilient and flexible in a dynamic business environment. Foreign currency fluctuations and rapidly changing global trade policies, particularly those affecting the United States, increase the economic and operational uncertainties that could significantly harm our business and results of operations. Refer to Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report for further discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing our Company.\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResults of Operations\n \nThe following tables and discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations for the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024.\n \nComparison of 13-Weeks Ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024\n \n \nNet Sales\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n13-Weeks Ended\nSeptember 27, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear-over-Year Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13-Weeks Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitness\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n601,013\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n463,887\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutdoor\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n497,598\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(5\n\n\n%)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n526,551\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAviation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n240,445\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n204,631\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n267,005\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n222,244\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuto OEM\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n164,840\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2\n\n\n%)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n168,709\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,770,901\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,586,022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNet sales increased 12% for the 13-week period ended September 27, 2025 when compared to the year-ago quarter. Total unit sales in the third quarter of 2025 increased by approximately 8% to 4,982 when compared to total unit sales of 4,620 in the third quarter of 2024, which differs from the percent increase in revenue primarily due to shifts in segment and product mix. Fitness was the largest portion of our revenue mix in the third quarter of 2025 at 34%, while outdoor was the largest portion of our revenue mix in the third quarter of 2024 at 33%.\n \nThe increase in fitness revenue was driven by strong demand for advanced wearables. The increase in aviation revenue was driven by sales growth in OEM and aftermarket product categories. The increase in marine revenue was driven by sales growth across multiple product categories. Outdoor revenue decreased primarily due to consumer auto and adventure watch product categories comparing against strong prior year product launch cycles. Auto OEM revenue decreased as certain legacy programs approach end-of-life and were partially offset by growth in a recent domain controller program.\n \n \nGross Profit\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross Profit\n\n\n \n\n\n13-Weeks Ended\nSeptember 27, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear-over-Year Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13-Weeks Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitness\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n362,849\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n283,325\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutdoor\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n329,749\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(8\n\n\n%)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n358,693\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n66\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n68\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAviation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n180,708\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n154,138\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n148,238\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n122,433\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuto OEM\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24,943\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(24\n\n\n%)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n33,010\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Segment Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,046,487\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n951,599\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n59\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n \nGross profit dollars in the third quarter of 2025 increased 10%, primarily due to the increase in net sales when compared to the year-ago quarter, as described above.

The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the Euro is the functional currency of several subsidiaries, and the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds. Other notable currency exposures include the Australian Dollar and Polish Zloty. The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.\n \n \nThe $20.3 million currency gain recognized in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro, Polish Zloty, and British Pound Sterling, within the 13-week period ended September 27, 2025. During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.5% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $26.5 million, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 0.2% against the Euro, 1.0% against the Polish Zloty, and 2.3% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $2.6 million, $2.2 million, and $1.6 million, respectively. The remaining net currency gain of $0.2 million was related to the impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial.\n \nThe $18.1 million currency gain recognized in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar weakening against the British Pound Sterling, Euro, and Polish Zloty, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Taiwan Dollar, within the 13-week period ended September 28, 2024. During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 3.7% against the British Pound Sterling, 4.2% against the Euro, and 5.3% against the Polish Zloty, resulting in gains of $3.2 million, $8.9 million, and $9.3 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.9% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $10.4 million. The remaining net currency gain of $7.1 million was related to the impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial.\n \nIncome Tax Provision\n \n \nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $108.2 million in the 13-week period ended September 27, 2025, compared to income tax expense of $87.1 million in the 13-week period ended September 28, 2024. The effective tax rate was 21.2% in the third quarter of 2025, compared to 17.9% in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in the effective tax rate in the current quarter was primarily driven by the U.S. tax legislation enacted during the current quarter, which, among other things, changed capitalization requirements of certain research and development costs, resulting in a year-to-date adjustment due to a decrease in certain expected U.S. tax deductions and credits.\n \n \nNet Income\n \n \nAs a result of the above, net income for the 13-week period ended September 27, 2025 was $401.6 million compared to $399.1 million for the 13-week period ended September 28, 2024, an increase of $2.5 million.\n \n \nComparison of 39-Weeks Ended September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024\n \nNet Sales\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n39-Weeks Ended\nSeptember 27, 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear-over-Year Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39-Weeks Ended\nSeptember 28, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitness\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,591,159\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,235,182\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n31\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutdoor\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,426,451\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,332,617\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAviation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n712,926\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n639,739\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n885,704\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n821,933\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuto OEM\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n504,324\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n444,871\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Total Net Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,120,564\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,474,342\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNet sales increased 14% for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2025 when compared to the year-ago period.

The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the Euro is the functional currency of several subsidiaries, and the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds. Other notable currency exposures include the Australian Dollar and Polish Zloty. The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.\n \n \nThe $21.6 million currency gain recognized in the 39-week period ended September 27, 2025 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Taiwan Dollar, within the 39-week period ended September 27, 2025. During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 12.2% against the Euro and 6.5% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $46.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 7.8% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $35.1 million. The remaining net currency gain of $7.3 million was related to the impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial.\n \nThe $15.6 million currency gain recognized in the 39-week period ended September 28, 2024 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar within the 39-week period ended September 28, 2024. During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 2.8% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $19.6 million. The remaining net currency loss of $4.0 million was related to the impacts of other drivers, each of which was individually immaterial.\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nIncome Tax Provision\n \n \nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $243.9 million in the first three quarters of 2025, compared to income tax expense of $203.6 million in the first three quarters of 2024. The effective tax rate was 17.7% in the first three quarters of 2025, compared to 17.3% in the first three quarters of 2024. The increase in the effective tax rate in the current period was primarily driven by the U.S. tax legislation enacted during the current quarter, which, among other things, changed capitalization requirements of certain research and development costs, resulting in a decrease in certain expected U.S. tax deductions and credits.\nNet Income\n \n \nAs a result of the above, net income for the 39-week period ended September 27, 2025 was $1,135.2 million compared to $975.7 million for the 39-week period ended September 28, 2024, an increase of $159.5 million.\n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nWe primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash requirements may be used, to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, fund share repurchases, and fund strategic acquisitions. We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our short- and long-term projected working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other cash requirements.\n \nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\n \nAs of September 27, 2025, we had approximately $3.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management invests idle or surplus cash in accordance with the Company's investment policy, which has been approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The investment policy’s primary objectives are to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. Garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during the first three quarters of 2025 and 2024 were 3.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, the performance of the underlying collateral, and the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. See Note 4 – Marketable Securities in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding marketable securities.\n \nCash Flows\n \nCash provided by operating activities totaled $1,079.6 million for the first three quarters of 2025, compared to $948.6 million for the first three quarters of 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers primarily driven by higher net sales, partially offset by increases in cash paid for cost of goods sold and operating expenses and a strategic increase in inventory in the first three quarters of 2025 compared to the first three quarters of 2024.\n \n \nCash used in investing activities totaled $513.8 million for the first three quarters of 2025, compared to $190.8 million for the first three quarters of 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions, an increase in net purchases of marketable securities, and an increase in purchases of property and equipment in the first three quarters of 2025 compared to the first three quarters of 2024.\n \nCash used in financing activities totaled $625.5 million for the first three quarters of 2025, compared to $449.4 million for the first three quarters of 2024. This increase was primarily due to higher purchases of treasury shares under the share repurchase plan, higher cash dividend payments, and an increase in the purchase of treasury shares related to equity awards in the first three quarters of 2025 compared to the first three quarters of 2024.\n \nUse of Cash\n \nOperating Leases\n \nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain real estate properties, vehicles, and equipment. Leased properties are typically used for office space, distribution, data centers, and retail. As of September 27, 2025, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $222.7 million, with $42.8 million payable within 12 months.\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInventory Purchase Obligations\n \n \nThe Company obtains various raw materials and components for its products from a variety of third party suppliers.

The presentation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n \nFor a description of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024. There were no significant changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates in the 13-week and 39-week periods ended September 27, 2025.\n \n \n\n\n24"
