The Company differentiates itself in a crowded media and entertainment marketplace through the leadership positions of its brands and premium programming that focus on live and “appointment-based” content, a significant presence in major markets, and broad distribution of its content across traditional and digital platforms.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nPremium brands that resonate deeply with viewers.\nUnder the FOX banner, we produce and distribute content through some of the world’s leading and most valued brands. Our long track record of challenging the status quo emboldens us to continue making innovative decisions, disrupting norms and forming deeper relationships with audiences. FOX News Media is among the most influential and recognized news brands in the world. FOX Sports has earned a reputation for bold sports programming and, with its availability in virtually every U.S. market, is a leading destination for live sports events and sports commentary. Tubi, our leading AVOD service, attracts a young, diverse and highly engaged audience to its content library of nearly 300,000 movies and television episodes. FOX Entertainment is renowned for its compelling primetime entertainment, including scripted dramas, leading unscripted programming and its longstanding Sunday animation block. These brands and others in our portfolio, such as our 29 owned and operated local television stations, including 18 broadcasting under the FOX brand, hold cultural significance with consumers and commercial importance for distributors and advertisers. The quality of our programming and the strength of our brands maximize the value of our content through a combination of affiliate fees and advertising sales.\nLeadership positions across strategically significant programming platforms.\nFOX enjoys leadership positions across its core news, sports and entertainment businesses. As linear television viewership declines across the industry, “appointment-based” programming that is the FOX hallmark remains resilient.\nFor over 20 consecutive years, FOX News has been the top-rated national cable news channel in Monday to Friday primetime viewing, according to The Nielsen Company (“Nielsen”). FOX News also finished the fiscal year as the #1 cable network in Monday to Friday primetime and total day viewing among total viewers for the tenth consecutive year and delivered ratings that were comparable to ratings delivered by the four broadcast networks in weekday primetime viewing. A leader in marquee live sports broadcasts, FOX Sports programs the National Football League (“NFL”) featuring \nAmerica's Game of the Week\n), college football (including the Big Ten Conference), Major League Baseball's (“MLB”) Regular Season, \nAll-Star Game\n and post-season, including exclusive rights to the \nWorld Series\n, National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing (“NASCAR”) and other marquee cyclical events, including the \nSuper Bowl\n and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (“FIFA”) Men's \nWorld Cup\n. FOX Sports has secured a significant portion of its marquee rights under long-term contracts. Under FOX’s ownership, Tubi has become one of the most relevant and \n2\nfastest growing AVOD services in the country, with 13% growth in total view time (the total number of hours watched) in fiscal 2025 compared to the prior fiscal year. Tubi finished the fiscal year with approximately 2.2% share of all television viewing according to Nielsen’s \nThe Gauge\n, making it among the most watched free ad-supported streaming services in the U.S. FOX Entertainment has delivered the youngest and most diverse audience of the broadcast networks across all programming in primetime for over two decades. During the 2024-2025 broadcast season, FOX Entertainment featured two of the season’s top three debuts including the #1 Comedy \nUniversal Basic Guys\n, along with television’s three highest-rated and most watched cooking shows \nNext Level Chef\n, \nHell’s Kitchen\n and \nKitchen Nightmares\n. FOX Television Stations covers 18 Nielsen-designated market areas (“DMAs”), including 14 of the 15 largest, and was the #1 or #2 rated news provider in the hours of 5 a.m. - 9 a.m. in the majority of the markets in which it operates among adults 25-54.\nWe believe the strength and leadership of our brands will continue to support our ability to secure industry leading affiliate rate and advertising price increases, while enabling us to nimbly respond to the opportunities and challenges traditional media companies are facing as technologies and changes in consumer behavior continue to rapidly evolve.\nSignificant presence and relevance in major domestic markets.\nThe FOX portfolio combines the range of national cable and broadcast networks and digital distribution platforms with the power of tailored local television. FOX News and FOX Business are available in approximately 60 million U.S. households and FOX Sports and FOX Entertainment programming on the FOX Network is available in virtually every U.S. market. Tubi’s ubiquitous availability provides broad distribution of films, episodic television programming, live local and national news content and sports programming. Tubi carries over 100 local station feeds (including feeds of our owned and operated stations), covering 78 DMAs and 23 of the top 25 markets. Additionally, our 29 owned and operated television stations cover 18 DMAs, including 14 of the 15 largest, and maintain duopolies in 11 DMAs, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, the three largest. These stations provide balanced content of national interest with programming of note to local communities, producing over 1,350 hours of local news coverage each week. The breadth and depth of our footprint allows us to produce and distribute our content in a cost-effective manner and share best business practices and models across regions. It also enables us to engage audiences, develop deeper consumer relationships and create more compelling product offerings.\nAttractive financial profile, including multiple revenue streams, strong balance sheet and other assets.\nWe have consistently achieved strong operational and financial results in a complex industry environment. Additionally, our solid balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest across our businesses, allocate resources toward investments in growth initiatives, take advantage of strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions across the range of media categories in which we operate and related adjacencies, and return capital to our stockholders. We have maintained significant liquidity, ending fiscal 2025 with approximately $5.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet while returning approximately $1.25 billion of capital to our stockholders through our stock repurchase program and cash dividends and retiring $600 million of debt during fiscal 2025. We also benefit from a tax asset that resulted from the step-up in the tax basis of our assets following the Transaction, which is expected to provide an annual cash tax benefit for many years. Our asset portfolio also includes the FOX Studio Lot in Los Angeles, California, which spans over 50 acres and close to 2 million square feet of space for administration and television and film production services available to industry clients, including 15 sound stages, and other production facilities. Additionally, we own an equity stake in Flutter Entertainment plc (“Flutter”), an online sports betting and gaming company with operations in the U.S. and internationally, and we maintain a valuable option to acquire 18.6% of FanDuel Group, a majority-owned subsidiary of Flutter.\nGoals and Strategies\nMaintain leading positions in live news, live sports and quality entertainment.\nWe have long been a leader in news, sports and entertainment programming, and we believe that building on our leading market positions is essential to our success. The strength of our core businesses has allowed us to invest in attractive growth opportunities and brand extensions. Examples of this include digital brand extensions at FOX News Media, including the FOX Nation SVOD service and the FOX Weather free ad-supported streaming television (“FAST”) service. At Tubi, our investment in content, technology and marketing \n3\nhas yielded new viewers and increased engagement from our audience, which has translated into robust revenue growth. In fiscal 2025, Tubi expanded its content library through the premiere of over 70 new original titles and the launch of 40 sports, entertainment and local news channels, for a total of over 320 sports, entertainment and local news channels as of the end of the fiscal year. We consistently review opportunities to optimize our sports portfolio with the dual goal of maintaining and growing our audience while achieving accretive financial returns. In fiscal 2025, we added rights from INDYCAR and LIV Golf and an extension of Big East Conference rights through 2031 while concluding our agreement with WWE. Recognizing the industry-wide changes in viewership habits, FOX Entertainment has continued to expand its footprint across unscripted content, leveraging the breadth of offerings from FOX Entertainment Studios to populate its primetime lineup and reduce its reliance on third-party content providers. FOX Entertainment Studios also produces or co-produces original content for third parties including many of the leading SVOD services (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Apple TV+), highlighting the attractiveness of FOX’s content to a wide variety of streaming services. FOX Television Stations’ rollout of local news content on connected televisions and FAST services in a number of markets has led to the stations’ total view time growing over 150% as compared to the prior fiscal year across FOX Local Streams and LiveNOW from FOX. We believe continuing to provide compelling news, sports and entertainment programming across platforms will increase audience engagement and drive growth across our distribution, affiliate and advertising relationships.\nIncrease revenue growth through the continued delivery of high quality, premium and valuable content.\nWith a focused portfolio of assets, we create and produce high quality programming that delivers value for our viewers, our affiliates and our advertisers. We expect our internal production capabilities and co-production arrangements will facilitate growth by enabling us to directly manage the economics and programming decisions of our broadcast network and television stations. We also believe our unique ability to deliver “appointment-based” viewing and audiences at scale, along with innovative advertising platforms, delivers substantial value to our advertising customers, and the unique nature of our “appointment-based” content positions us to maintain and even grow audiences during a time of increasing consumer fragmentation.\nExpand our digital distribution offerings and direct engagement with consumers, increasing complementary sources of revenues.\nThe availability of our key networks on all major virtual MVPD services reflects the strength of our brands and the highly coveted nature of our content. We are also cultivating and growing direct interactions between FOX brands and consumers outside traditional linear television. For example, Tubi provides us with a wholly-owned digital platform to access a wider digital audience and further the reach of our content. Tubi continues to experience significant growth in total view time across a library of nearly 300,000 movies and television episodes, including key FOX entertainment, news and sports programming, and it streamed approximately 11 billion hours of content over the course of the fiscal year (a record for the platform). Tubi’s young, diverse and highly engaged viewers, the majority of which are classified as “cord-cutters” or “cord-nevers,” is an audience that advertisers are eager to reach. FOX News Media operates a number of digital businesses, including FOX News Digital, which remains the most engaged brand in digital news (leading in total views, minutes spent and social interactions), along with the FOX Nation SVOD service, which offers U.S. consumers a variety of content (including original programming), and FOX Weather, which offers local, regional and national weather reporting in addition to live programming. Additionally, FOX Television Stations operates a portfolio of digital businesses, including the FLX (or FOX Local Extension) digital advertising platform and the LiveNOW from FOX, FOX Local Streams and FOX Soul FAST services, in addition to distributing its local news programming on Tubi and across a range of third-party platforms. FOX One, our wholly-owned, direct-to-consumer subscription streaming service, is expected to launch by the Fall of 2025 and expand the reach of our programming beyond FOX’s existing footprint.\nReportable Segments\nCable Network Programming\nThe Cable Network Programming segment produces and licenses news, business news and sports content for distribution through traditional and virtual MVPDs and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S. The businesses in this segment include FOX News Media (which includes FOX News and FOX Business) and our primary cable sports programming networks FS1, FS2, the Big Ten Network and FOX Deportes.\n4\nThe following table lists the Company’s significant cable networks and the number of subscribers as estimated by Nielsen:\nAs of June 30,\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nFOX News Media Networks\nFOX News\n61 \n67 \nFOX Business\n60 \n65 \nFOX Sports Networks\nFS1\n61 \n67 \nFS2\n44 \n48 \nThe Big Ten Network\n42 \n45 \nFOX Deportes\n10 \n12 \nFOX News Media\n.

Cable network programming is a highly competitive business. Cable networks compete for content, distribution, viewers and advertisers with a variety of media, including broadcast television networks; cable television systems and networks; direct-to-consumer streaming and on-demand platforms and services; mobile, gaming and social media platforms; audio programming; and print and other media. Important competitive factors include the prices charged for programming, the quantity, quality and variety of programming offered, the accessibility of such programming, the ability to adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms, the quality of user experience and the effectiveness of marketing efforts. Competition for sales of advertising time is based primarily on the anticipated and actually delivered size and demographic characteristics of audiences as determined by various measurement services, price, the time of day when the advertising is to be broadcast, competition from other cable networks, broadcast networks, cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite television, social and digital media, and general economic conditions. Competition for audiences is based primarily on the selection of programming, the popularity and success of which depend on the reaction of the viewing public, which is often difficult to predict.\nFOX News Media\n. FOX News' primary competition comes from the broadcast networks' national news divisions and cable news networks such as CNN and MSNBC. FOX Business' primary competition comes from the cable networks CNBC and Bloomberg Television. FOX News and FOX Business also compete for viewers and advertisers within a broad spectrum of television networks, including other non-news cable networks, free-to-air broadcast television networks and direct-to-consumer streaming and on-demand platforms and services. FOX News and FOX Business also face competition online from CNN.com, NBCNews.com, NYTimes.com, CNBC.com, Bloomberg.com, Yahoo.com, The Wall Street Journal Online, YouTube, social media platforms and audio and podcast networks, among others.\nFOX Sports\n. A number of basic and pay television programming services, direct-to-consumer streaming services, and free-to-air stations and broadcast networks compete with FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network for sports programming rights, distribution, audiences and advertisers. On a national level, the primary competitors to FS1, FS2, and the Big Ten Network are ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, USA Network, CBS Sports Network and The CW Network; league-owned networks such as NFL Network, NHL Network, NBA TV and MLB Network; collegiate conference-specific networks such as the SEC Network and ACC Network; and direct-to-consumer streaming services such as ESPN+, YouTube, Peacock, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Apple TV+, Paramount+, HBO Max and Roku, among others. In regional markets, the Big Ten Network competes with regional sports networks, local broadcast television stations and other sports programming providers and distributors.\n6\nTelevision\nThe Television segment produces, acquires, markets and distributes programming through the FOX broadcast network, the Tubi AVOD service, broadcast television stations and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S. The segment also includes various production companies that produce content for the Company and third parties.\nThe FOX Network\nThe FOX Network is a premier national television broadcast network, renowned for disrupting legacy broadcasters with powerful sports programming and appealing primetime entertainment.

Entertainment programming is obtained from major television studios, including 20th Television (formerly known as Twentieth Century Fox Television and which is owned by Disney), Sony Pictures Television and Warner Bros.

The terms of these agreements generally provide the FOX Network with the right to acquire broadcast rights to a television series for a minimum of four seasons. Entertainment programming is also provided by the Company's in-house production companies described below.\nThe FOX Network provides programming to affiliated stations and the right to broadcast network television programming on the affiliated stations in accordance with agreements of varying durations. Such agreements typically run three or more years and have staggered expiration dates. These affiliation agreements require affiliated stations to carry the FOX Network programming in all time periods in which the FOX Network programming is offered to those affiliated stations, subject to certain exceptions stated in the affiliation agreements.\n7\nTubi\nTubi is a leading AVOD service that is available on multiple digital platforms in the United States and select international regions.

Of the 29 full power broadcast television stations, 18 stations are affiliated with the FOX Network. These stations leverage viewer, distributor and advertiser demand for the FOX Network’s national content.

The Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) applies a discount (the “UHF Discount\"), which attributes only 50% of the television households in a local television market to the audience reach of a UHF television station for purposes of calculating whether that station’s owner complies with the national station ownership cap imposed by FCC regulations and by statute; in making this calculation, only the station’s RF Broadcast Channel is considered. In a duopoly market, both stations must be UHF for the discount to apply. In addition, the coverage of two commonly owned stations in the same market is counted only once. The percentages listed are rounded and do not take into account the UHF Discount. For more information regarding the FCC’s national station ownership cap, see “Government Regulation.”\n(b)\nMyNetworkTV licensee station.\n(c)\nWWOR-TV hosts television station WRNN, New Rochelle, NY, licensed to WRNN License Company, LLC, an unrelated third party pursuant to a channel sharing agreement between FOX Television Stations and shared WRNN License Company, LLC.

Station KFTC is in addition to the 29 full power stations described in this section.\n9\n(g)\nWITI hosts television station WVCY, Milwaukee, WI, licensed to VCY America, Inc., an unrelated third party pursuant to a channel sharing agreement between WITI Television, LLC, the predecessor in interest of FOX Television Stations, and VCY America, Inc. A portion of the spectrum family licensed to WITI is now shared with and licensed to WVCY.\nDigital Distribution\nThe Company’s Television segment also distributes programming through FOX-branded websites, apps, podcasts and social media accounts and licenses programming for distribution through MVPDs’ websites and apps. The Company’s websites and apps, which include FOX.com, FOXSports.com and TMZ.com and the FOX Sports and TMZ mobile apps, provide live and/or on-demand streaming of FOX Network shows and programming from broadcast stations affiliated with the FOX Network. Other digital properties offering Television segment programming and other content include Tubi and the TMZ FAST service. FOX Television Stations distributes content across websites and mobile apps associated with the stations, Tubi, a range of third-party platforms and FOX Television Station’s FAST services. These services include LiveNOW from FOX, which offers live news coverage; FOX Local Streams, a group of FAST services that offer live and recorded content from 17 FOX-owned and operated local television stations; and FOX Soul, a service dedicated to the African American viewer that features original and syndicated programming. The Company’s FAST services are distributed across multiple devices and platforms, including traditional and virtual MVPDs, Tubi, connected TV device platforms and other digital platforms. In addition, the Company expects to launch the FOX One direct-to-consumer subscription streaming service by the Fall of 2025. See “—Other” below.\nFOX Entertainment Studios\nThrough its FOX Entertainment Studios business, the Company produces entertainment programming for its own traditional and digital entertainment platforms, as well as for third parties. TMZ produces daily syndicated magazine programs, broadcast and other television specials, and other content for distribution on traditional and digital platforms, including FOX Television Stations, Tubi, FOX Nation and other digital platforms. The Company also operates a co-owned production company with Gordon Ramsay called Studio Ramsay Global that develops, produces and distributes culinary and lifestyle programming such as \nNext Level Chef\n and \nNext Level Baker\n for FOX, and other programs for global markets. FOX Alternative Entertainment develops and produces unscripted and alternative programming primarily for the FOX Network, including \nThe Masked Singer, I Can See Your Voice \nand \nName That Tune\n. Animation production company Bento Box Entertainment produces programming for cable and broadcast networks (including programming such as \nKrapopolis, Grimsburg, Universal Basic Guys, Bob's Burgers\n and \nThe Great North\n that air on the FOX Network) and digital platforms.\nFOX Entertainment Global\nFOX Entertainment Global is FOX’s wholly-owned sales and distribution business. FOX Entertainment Global engages in domestic and international sales and licenses of scripted and unscripted series and other programs owned or controlled by various FOX entities, as well as content owned by third parties that contract with FOX Entertainment Global for distribution.\nMyNetworkTV\nThe programming distribution service, Master Distribution Service, Inc. (branded as MyNetworkTV), distributes two hours per night, Monday through Friday, of off-network programming from syndicators to its over 185 licensee stations, including 11 stations owned and operated by the Company, and is available to approximately 95% of U.S. households as of June 30, 2025.\nCompetition\nThe network television broadcasting business is highly competitive. The FOX Network (with respect to both its sports and entertainment programming), MyNetworkTV and Tubi compete for audiences, programming and advertising revenue with a variety of competing media, including other broadcast television networks; cable television systems and networks; direct-to-consumer streaming and on-demand platforms and services; mobile, gaming and social media platforms; audio programming; and print and other media. In addition, the FOX Network and MyNetworkTV compete with other broadcast networks and programming distribution services to secure affiliations or station agreements with independently owned television stations in markets across the U.S. ABC, NBC and CBS each broadcast a significantly greater number of hours of programming than the FOX \n10\nNetwork and, accordingly, may be able to designate or change time periods in which programming is to be broadcast with greater flexibility than the FOX Network. Technological developments are also continuing to affect competition within the broadcast television marketplace. Our entertainment programming production businesses compete with other content creators for creative talent, new content ideas, intellectual property and the distribution of their content. FOX Entertainment Global competes with other content licensors and sellers for the distribution of its content.\nEach of the stations owned and operated by FOX Television Stations also competes for advertising revenues with other television stations, radio and cable systems in its respective market area, along with other advertising media, including direct-to-consumer streaming and on-demand platforms and services; mobile, gaming and social media platforms; newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising and direct mail. All of the stations owned and operated by FOX Television Stations are located in highly competitive markets. Additional factors that affect the competitive position of each of the television stations include management experience, authorized power and assigned frequency of that station. Competition for sales of broadcast advertising time is based primarily on the anticipated and actually delivered size and demographic characteristics of audiences as determined by various rating services, price, the time of day when the advertising is to be broadcast, competition from the other broadcast networks, cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite television, services and digital media and general economic conditions. Competition for audiences is based primarily on the selection of programming, the acceptance of which is dependent on the reaction of the viewing public, which is often difficult to predict.\nOther\nFOX Studio Lot\nFOX owns the FOX Studio Lot in Los Angeles, California. The historic lot is located on over 50 acres of land and has over 1.85 million square feet of space for both administration and production and post-production services available to service a wide array of industry clients, including 15 sound stages, theaters and screening rooms, editing rooms and other television and film production facilities. The FOX Studio Lot provides two primary revenue streams — the lease of a portion of the office space to Disney and other third parties and the operation of studio facilities for third-party productions, which until March of 2026 are predominantly Disney productions.\nCredible\nThe Company holds 66% of the equity in Credible Labs Inc. (“Credible”), which operates consumer finance and insurance marketplaces in the U.S. Credible’s offerings provide consumers personalized product and rate options for a range of financial products, including student loans, personal loans, mortgages and insurance policies from multiple consumer lending and insurance providers. The put right held by the Credible minority interest shareholder was exercised in December 2024, and the put transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2026.\nFOX One\nIn February 2025, FOX announced a wholly-owned, direct-to-consumer streaming service called FOX One, offering to subscribers live streaming and on-demand access to the full portfolio of FOX brands, including FOX News, FOX Sports, the FOX Network, the Big Ten Network, FOX Business, FOX Weather, FS1, FS2, FOX Deportes and FOX Television Stations. The service is expected to launch by the Fall of 2025 and expand the reach of the Company’s programming beyond FOX’s existing footprint.\nInvestments\nFlutter\nThe Company holds an equity interest in Flutter, an online sports betting and gaming company with operations in the U.S. and internationally. The Company owns approximately 4.3 million ordinary shares, which represents approximately 2.4% of Flutter as of June 30, 2025. In addition, FOX Sports holds a 10-year call option expiring in December 2030 to acquire an 18.6% equity interest in Flutter's majority-owned subsidiary, FanDuel Group (\"FanDuel\"), the exercise of which is subject to certain conditions and applicable gambling \n11\nregulatory approvals. As of June 30, 2025, the option exercise price is approximately $4.5 billion. FOX has no obligation to commit capital towards this opportunity unless and until it exercises the option. In addition, Flutter cannot pursue an initial public offering for FanDuel without FOX's consent or approval from the arbitrator who presided over a FOX-Flutter arbitration in 2021 and 2022.\nUnited Football League\nLaunched in January 2024, the UFL is a professional spring football league that consists of eight teams playing a 40-game regular season schedule in addition to two playoff games and a championship game. FOX Sports and Disney/ESPN are the domestic distribution partners of the UFL games under multi-year rights agreements. As of June 30, 2025, the Company owns approximately 42% of the UFL.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe Communications Act and FCC Regulation\nThe television broadcast industry in the U.S. is highly regulated by federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various agencies, including the FCC. The FCC regulates television broadcasting, and certain aspects of the operations of cable, satellite and other electronic media that compete with broadcasting, pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The introduction of new laws and regulations or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws and regulations could have a negative impact on the operations, prospects and financial performance of the Company.\nBroadcast Licenses\n. The Communications Act permits the operation of television broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The Company, through its subsidiaries, holds broadcast licenses in connection with its ownership and operation of television stations. Under the Communications Act, television broadcast licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years. Generally, the FCC renews broadcast licenses upon finding that the television station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. The next renewal cycle for FOX Television Stations’ FCC applications for its full power broadcast licenses will commence in June of 2028. One television station license from the previous renewal cycle is subject to an administrative appeal at the FCC.\nOwnership Regulations\n. Under the FCC’s national television ownership rule, one party may own television stations with a collective national audience reach of not more than 39% of all U.S. television households, subject to the UHF discount. Under the UHF discount, a UHF television station is attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its market for purposes of calculating national audience reach. In December 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking pursuant to which it will consider modifying, retaining or eliminating the 39% national television audience reach limitation (including the UHF discount). In June of 2025, the FCC released a Public Notice seeking to refresh the record on whether to eliminate the national ownership cap. The Public Notice seeks public comment on, among other things, whether networks and broadcast affiliates should be treated differently for purposes of the national ownership cap. Depending on the outcome of this deregulation examination, the Company’s ability to acquire television stations in additional markets may be affected.\nThe Company is also subject to other communications laws and regulations relating to ownership. For example, FCC dual network rules prohibit any of the four major broadcast television networks — FOX, ABC, CBS, and NBC — from being under common ownership or control. In addition, under the Communications Act, no broadcast station licensees may be owned by a corporation if more than 25% of the corporation’s stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, their representatives or by any other corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. This ownership limit can be waived if the FCC finds it to be in the public interest. The FCC could review the Company’s compliance with the foreign ownership regulations in connection with its consideration of FOX Television Stations’ license renewal applications. The Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) to take action to prevent, cure or mitigate the effect of stock ownership above the applicable foreign ownership threshold, including: refusing to permit any transfer of common stock to or ownership of common stock by a non-U.S. stockholder; \n12\nvoiding a transfer of common stock to a non-U.S. stockholder; suspending rights of stock ownership if held by a non-U.S. stockholder; or redeeming common stock held by a non-U.S. stockholder.\nMust-Carry/Retransmission Consent\n. FCC regulations require each television broadcaster to elect, at three-year intervals, either to require carriage of its signal by traditional MVPDs in the station’s market or to negotiate the terms through which that broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the traditional MVPDs within its market, which we refer to as retransmission consent. FOX Television Stations have historically elected retransmission consent for all of their owned and operated stations, and the Company has been compensated as a result.\nChildren’s Programming\n. Federal legislation limits the amount of commercial matter that may be broadcast during programming originally designed for children 12 years of age and younger to 10 ½ minutes per hour during the weekend and 12 minutes per hour during the week. In addition, FCC regulations generally require television stations to broadcast a minimum of three hours per week of programming, which, among other requirements, must serve, as a “significant purpose,” the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of age and under. Under FCC rules, one of the three hours per week may air on a television station’s multicast stream(s); the other two hours must air on the primary programming stream. A television station found not to have complied with the programming requirements or commercial limitations could face sanctions, including monetary fines and the possible non-renewal of its license.\nProgram Regulation\n. The FCC also regulates the content of broadcast, cable network, and other video programming. The FCC prohibits broadcasters from airing obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. The FCC also monitors compliance relating to political advertising, identification of program sponsors and the use and integrity of the Emergency Alert System. In addition, FCC regulations require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and/or cable programming, as well as certain programming in the U.S. delivered by internet protocol. Broadcast television stations in certain markets that are affiliated with one of the four major U.S. broadcast networks must also provide a certain amount of programming every quarter that includes audio-narrated description of a program’s key visual elements that make the program accessible to blind and low-vision viewers. Commercials embedded in our networks’ television content stream also must adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material.\nAdvertising Regulation\n. The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has increased its focus on unfair and deceptive advertising practices, particularly with respect to social media marketing. Both FCC and FTC rules and guidance require marketers to clearly and conspicuously disclose whenever there has been payment for a marketing message or when there is a material connection between an advertiser and a product endorser. Additionally, a number of states have recently introduced or passed legislation as it relates to disclosures of the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) in political advertising. The disclosure and record retention requirements for AI in political advertising vary greatly by state.\nBroadcast Affiliation\n. In addition, FCC regulations govern various aspects of the agreements between networks and affiliated broadcast stations, including a mandate that television broadcast station licensees retain the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national importance.\nBroadcast Transmission Standard\n. In November 2017, the FCC adopted rules to permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the “Next Generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also referred to as “ATSC 3.0” or “NEXTGEN TV”. FOX Television Stations is actively building out ATSC 3.0 facilities and is participating in various ATSC 3.0 testing with other broadcasters, but it is too early to predict the impact of this technical standard on the Company's operations. In June 2020, the FCC adopted a Declaratory Ruling and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking declaring that local and national ownership restrictions do not apply to non-video services. In June 2023, the FCC issued a Report and Order that extended the simulcast requirement for ATSC 1.0 and ATSC 3.0 signals to July 2027. In early 2025, the National Association of Broadcasters filed a petition seeking an end of the simulcast requirements and a hard transition deadline to ATSC 3.0 standard. This proceeding may impact the roll out of both video and non-video ATSC 3.0 services.\n13\nViolation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary forfeitures, periodic reporting conditions, short-term license renewals and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of license. Violation of FTC-imposed obligations can result in enforcement actions, litigation, consent decrees and, ultimately, substantial monetary fines.\nPrivacy and Information Regulation\nThe laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving, particularly as they relate to the Company's digital businesses. Federal and state laws and regulations affecting the Company’s online services, websites and other business activities include: the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits websites and online services from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent; the Video Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the knowing disclosure of information that identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific video materials from a “video tape service provider;” the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which restricts certain marketing communications, such as text messages and calls, without explicit consent; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates the collection, handling, disclosure and use of certain personal information by companies that offer consumers financial products or services, imposes notice obligations and provides certain individual rights regarding the use and disclosure of certain information; and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) (as amended by the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”)), which imposes broad obligations on the collection, use, handling and disclosure of personal information of California residents. For example, subject to certain exceptions, the CCPA provides individual rights for Californians, such as the right to access, delete, correct, and restrict the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information, including in connection with targeted advertising. Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have similar privacy laws that became effective in 2023.\nA number of privacy and data security bills and regulations that address the collection, retention, disclosure, and use of personal information, breach notification requirements and cybersecurity that would impose additional obligations on businesses, including in connection with targeted advertising, are pending or have been adopted at the state and federal level. More than a dozen other states have passed or introduced similar privacy legislation. In addition, the FTC and state attorneys general and other regulators have made privacy and data security an enforcement focus. Other federal and state laws and regulations that could impact our businesses also have been or may be adopted, such as those relating to minors, tailored advertising and its measurement, and oversight of user-generated content, as well as U.S. national security restrictions regarding the transfer of certain U.S. data, such as the Preventing Access to U.S. Sensitive Personal Data and Government-Related Data by Countries of Concern or Covered Persons Rule issued by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, certain international and federal laws and all 50 states have data breach notification legislation that require businesses to notify individuals and government agencies in the event of unauthorized access or exfiltration of certain personal information.\nForeign jurisdictions also have implemented and continue to introduce new privacy and data security laws and regulations, which apply to certain of the Company’s operations. It is possible that our current data protection policies and practices may be deemed inconsistent with new legal requirements or interpretations thereof and could result in the violation of these new laws and regulations. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, in particular, regulates the collection, use and security of personal data and restricts the trans-border flow of such data. Other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, China, and Mexico, also have enacted data protection legislation.\nThe Company monitors and considers these laws and regulations, particularly with respect to the design and operation of digital content services and legal and regulatory compliance programs. There may be changes in laws and regulations or judicial or regulators’ interpretation or enforcement thereof and regulatory agencies may change their priorities or activities with respect to such laws and regulations. Any of these could result in increased compliance costs, claims, changes to business practices, including with respect to tailored advertising, or otherwise impact the Company’s business. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in significant monetary fines and other penalties, private litigation, require us to expend significant resources to defend, remedy and/or address, harm our reputation or subject us to increased scrutiny from regulators or stakeholders, even if we are not ultimately responsible for the violation.\n14\nConsumer Finance Laws and Regulations\nCredible operates consumer finance and insurance marketplaces that market and provide services in heavily regulated industries across the United States. As a result, Credible is subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations. These include the laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information described above and the following:\n•\nthe Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or “RESPA,” and similar state laws, and federal and state unfair and deceptive acts and practices, or “UDAAP,” laws and regulations, which place restrictions on the manner in which consumer loans and insurance products are marketed and originated and the amount and nature of fees that may be charged or paid to Credible by lenders, insurance carriers and real estate professionals;\n•\nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which, among other things, imposes requirements related to mortgage disclosures; and\n•\nfederal and state licensing laws, such as the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, or “SAFE Act,” which establishes minimum standards for the licensing and regulation of mortgage loan originators, and state insurance licensing laws.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company’s intellectual property assets include copyrights in television and other programming, other publications, websites, digital properties and technologies; trademarks, trade dress, service marks, logos, slogans, sound marks, design rights, symbols, characters, names, titles and trade names, domain names; patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, trade secrets and know how; and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. The Company derives value from these assets through the production, distribution and/or licensing of its programming to third-party distributors, the operation of websites and other digital properties, and through the sale of products, such as collectible merchandise, apparel, books and publications, among others.\nThe Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property, relying on a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. There can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Policing unauthorized use of the Company’s products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult, and the steps taken by the Company may not in every case prevent the infringement. The Company seeks to limit that threat through a combination of approaches, including offering legitimate market alternatives, deploying digital rights management technologies, asserting infringement claims, and by pursuing takedowns and/or monetization of Company content uploaded to the Internet by third parties without Company authorization. Piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property.\nThird parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Company’s intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of the Company’s intellectual property rights. Even if not valid, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations. The legal landscape for new technologies, including AI, remains uncertain, and development of the law in this area could negatively impact the Company’s ability to protect against unauthorized third-party infringing uses or result in intellectual property infringement claims against the Company.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur workforce is the creative, strategic and operational engine of FOX’s success, and we are committed to developing and supporting our employees by offering competitive compensation and benefits, fostering a healthy work-life balance, providing growth and development opportunities, fostering workplace civility and inclusion and encouraging our employees to have an impact in their communities.\nAs of June 30, 2025, we had approximately 10,400 full-time employees. In the ordinary course of our business and consistent with industry practice, we also employ freelance and temporary workers who provide important production and broadcast support services. The vast majority of our workforce is based in the United \n15\nStates, and a portion is unionized. Our Employment Information Report (EEO-1) is available on our website at \nwww.foxcorporation.com\n. FOX’s Corporate Social Responsibility Report, also posted on our website at \nwww.foxcorporation.com\n, provides a detailed review of our human capital programs and achievements. Our key human capital initiatives include:\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\nWe are proud to invest in our people through competitive pay and comprehensive benefits designed to attract, motivate and retain our talent. Full-time employees and their family members are eligible for medical insurance, and eligible employees may participate in flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, and qualified transportation expense accounts. We also provide employees with a health advocate service. Eligible employees receive paid time-off programs, including vacation and sick and safe time, benefits such as life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, salary replacement for up to 26 weeks of short-term disability, basic long-term disability insurance, charitable gift matching, and an employee assistance program that offers onsite counseling in our New York and Los Angeles worksites. The FOX 401(k) Savings Plan provides employees with a company contribution, and it offers a company match, Roth and post-tax contribution options and catch-up contributions. Freelance employees who work a minimum number of hours are also eligible for a medical, dental and vision plan, as well as the 401(k) savings plan and health advocate service.\nEmployee Wellness and Workplace Flexibility\nWe believe offering our employees the tools necessary for a healthy work-life balance and overall wellness empowers them to thrive in our modern workforce. We have a robust parental leave policy, our workplaces have lactation rooms for our new mothers, and we offer onsite subsidized childcare to full-time Los Angeles employees and up to 40 days of backup child, adult, elder and return-to-work care. FOX maintains a partnership with the National Alliance on Mental Illness to provide additional mental health resources to employees, including courses on strategies to build resilience, maintain mental well-being and protect against workplace burnout.\nLearning and Development\nFOX offers employees multiple learning and development programs, including tuition reimbursement, management and leadership development, online and on-demand e-learning, live webinars and assessment tools. We deliver specialized training on the First Amendment, defamation, privacy, infringement and other newsgathering and reporting topics to educate employees on these principles and provide advice on best practices. Additionally, FOX has established and put into action numerous early career training initiatives aimed at equipping promising individuals with vital job skills and career advancement opportunities. The award-winning FOX Internship Program offers students an exciting opportunity to gain practical experience, participating in real-world projects and seminars on the media industry, technology and professional development.\nWorkplace Civility and Inclusion\nTrust begins in the workplace every single day. We are committed to fostering a working environment of trust for our colleagues, in which people do their best work. Harassment, discrimination, retaliation and threats to health and safety all undermine our working environment of trust and make it harder for people to excel. Therefore, it is our policy to provide a safe work environment free from this or any other unlawful conduct. Creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination and harassment begins at the highest leadership level of the Company and we have focused on embedding this commitment throughout our policies and practices. The FOX Standards of Business Conduct and the Preventing Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation Policy, which are posted on our website, create our framework for addressing complaints and taking remedial measures as needed. In addition, all new hires must complete training on the Preventing Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation Policy, as well as compliance and business ethics, and existing employees must complete the training periodically. FOX also has several employee-driven Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) formed around encouraging a more respectful workplace community and fostering a sense of belonging. All FOX colleagues are welcome to join or participate in any or multiple ERGs.\nCommunity Impact\nThrough FOX Forward, our corporate social responsibility program, we strategically invest in causes that align with FOX, our employees and our audience in an effort to create a positive impact in local communities. \n16\nOur primary areas of focus include serving veterans and active military members; expanding educational access for underserved students; and providing critical assistance to disaster-affected individuals.\n17",
  "item7": "ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nReaders should carefully review this document and the other documents filed by Fox Corporation (“FOX” or the “Company”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). This section should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements are referred to as the “Financial Statements” herein.\nINTRODUCTION\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company’s financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. This discussion is organized as follows:\n•\nOverview of the Company’s Business\n—This section provides a general description of the Company’s businesses, as well as developments that occurred either during the fiscal year ended June 30, (“fiscal”) 2025 or early fiscal 2026 that the Company believes are important in understanding its results of operations and financial condition or to disclose known trends.\n•\nResults of Operations\n—This section provides an analysis of the Company’s results of operations for fiscal 2025 and 2024. This analysis is presented on both a consolidated and a segment basis. In addition, a brief description is provided of significant transactions and events that impact the comparability of the results being analyzed.\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n—This section provides an analysis of the Company’s cash flows for fiscal 2025 and 2024, as well as a discussion of the Company’s outstanding debt and commitments, both firm and contingent, that existed as of June 30, 2025. Included in the discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund the Company’s future commitments and obligations, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements.\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n—This section discusses accounting policies considered important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in application and the Company’s use of estimates and assumptions consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In addition, Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying Financial Statements summarizes the Company’s significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policy discussion found in this section.\n•\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n—This section provides a description of the use of forward-looking information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Such information is based on management’s current expectations about future events which are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for a discussion of the risk factors applicable to the Company.\nRefer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 as filed with the SEC on August 8, 2024 for management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2023, including comparison to fiscal 2024.\nOVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS\nThe Company is a news, sports and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in four operating segments: Cable Network Programming, Television, Credible and the FOX Studio Lot with the \n34\nfollowing two reportable segments:\n•\nCable Network Programming\n, which produces and licenses news and sports content distributed through traditional cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators and telecommunication companies (“traditional MVPDs”), virtual multi-channel video programming distributors (“virtual MVPDs”) and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S.\n•\nTelevision\n, which produces, acquires, markets and distributes programming through the FOX broadcast network, advertising-supported video-on-demand (“AVOD”) service Tubi, 29 full power broadcast television stations, including 11 duopolies, and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S. Eighteen of the broadcast television stations are affiliated with the FOX Network and 11 are affiliated with MyNetworkTV. The segment also includes various production companies that produce content for the Company and third parties.\nThe Credible and the FOX Studio Lot operating segments do not meet the criteria under GAAP to be separately reported as a reportable segment or aggregated with other operating segments, and as such are presented as part of Corporate and Other, which is not a reportable segment. Corporate and Other principally consists of Credible, the FOX Studio Lot and corporate overhead costs. Credible is a U.S. consumer finance marketplace. The FOX Studio Lot, located in Los Angeles, California, provides television and film production services along with office space, studio operation services and includes all operations of the facility.\nWe use the term \"MVPDs\" to refer collectively to traditional MVPDs and virtual MVPDs.\nThe Company’s Cable Network Programming and Television segments derive the majority of their revenues from affiliate fees for the transmission of content and advertising sales. For fiscal 2025, the Company generated revenues of $16 billion, of which approximately 47% was generated from affiliate fees, approximately 42% was generated from advertising, and approximately 11% was generated from other operating activities.\nAffiliate fees primarily include (i) monthly subscriber-based license and retransmission consent fees paid by programming distributors that carry the Company’s cable networks and owned and operated television stations and (ii) fees received from non-owned and operated television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network. U.S. law governing retransmission consent provides a mechanism for the television stations owned by the Company to seek and obtain payment from MVPDs that carry the Company’s broadcast signals.\nFor more information, see Item 1. “Business” and Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”\n35\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations—Fiscal 2025 versus Fiscal 2024\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s operating results for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024:\n \nFor the years ended June 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\n \n \nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues\nAffiliate fee\n$\n7,656 \n$\n7,324 \n$\n332 \n5 \n%\nAdvertising\n6,865 \n5,444 \n1,421 \n26 \n%\nOther\n1,779 \n1,212 \n567 \n47 \n%\nTotal revenues\n16,300 \n13,980 \n2,320 \n17 \n%\nOperating expenses\n(10,518)\n(9,089)\n(1,429)\n(16)\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n(2,168)\n(2,024)\n(144)\n(7)\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n(385)\n(389)\n4 \n1 \n%\nRestructuring, impairment and other corporate matters\n(350)\n(67)\n(283)\n**\nEquity losses of affiliates\n(29)\n(44)\n15 \n34 \n%\nInterest expense, net\n(227)\n(216)\n(11)\n(5)\n%\nNon-operating other, net\n438 \n(47)\n485 \n**\nIncome before income tax expense\n3,061 \n2,104 \n957 \n45 \n%\nIncome tax expense\n(768)\n(550)\n(218)\n(40)\n%\nNet income\n2,293 \n1,554 \n739 \n48 \n%\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(30)\n(53)\n23 \n43 \n%\nNet income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders\n$\n2,263 \n$\n1,501 \n$\n762 \n51 \n%\n**\nnot meaningful\nOverview\n—The Company’s revenues increased $2.3 billion or 17% for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and other revenues. The increase of $332 million or 5% in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to the impact of higher average rates per subscriber and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network of approximately $790 million, partially offset by the approximately $460 million impact of a lower average number of subscribers across all networks. The increase of $1.4 billion or 26% in advertising revenue was primarily due to the approximately $870 million impact related to sports programming led by revenues from the broadcast of \nSuper Bowl LIX\n in February 2025 and higher National Football League (“NFL”) pricing. The remaining increase of approximately $550 million was primarily due to the impact of political advertising revenue due to the 2024 presidential and congressional elections predominantly at the Company’s owned and operated television stations, continued digital growth led by the Tubi AVOD service and higher news pricing and audiences. The increase of $567 million or 47% in other revenues was primarily due to higher sports sublicensing revenue.\nOperating expenses increased $1.4 billion or 16% for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to the approximately $1 billion impact of higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs driven by higher NFL costs, including the broadcast of\n Super Bowl LIX\n in February 2025, and higher college football costs, including licensing costs for rights that are sublicensed, partially offset by the absence of WWE. The remaining increase of approximately $380 million was primarily due to higher digital content costs, entertainment programming rights amortization and higher newsgathering costs principally due to the 2024 presidential election.\n36\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $144 million or 7% for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher employee costs.\nRestructuring, impairment and other corporate matters\n—See Note 4—Restructuring, Impairment and Other Corporate Matters to the accompanying Financial Statements.\nInterest expense, net\n—Interest expense, net increased $11 million or 5% for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by a lower average amount of debt outstanding.\nNon-operating other, net\n—See Note 20—Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Non-Operating Other, net.”\nIncome tax expense\n—The Company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 25% for fiscal 2025 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes and other permanent items.\nThe Company’s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 26% for fiscal 2024 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes.\nNet income\n—Net income increased $739 million or 48% for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher Segment EBITDA (as defined below) and a change in fair value of the Company’s investments in equity securities, partially offset by higher provision for income tax, the absence of a gain on a contribution of assets and the legal settlement and other costs associated with the discontinuation of Venu Sports (See Note 3—Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Financial Statements).\nSegment Analysis\nThe Company’s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company’s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is Segment EBITDA (defined below). Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. Intersegment transactions principally relate to the sublicensing of sports content and rental of studio and administrative space, which are recorded consistently with the recognition of transactions with third parties and are eliminated in consolidation.\nSegment EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters, Equity earnings (losses) of affiliates, Interest expense, net, Non-operating other, net and Income tax expense. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company’s operating segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, to monitor actual versus budget and prior fiscal year financial results, forecast future periods and perform competitive analyses to evaluate performance and allocate resources.\n37\nFiscal 2025 versus Fiscal 2024\nThe following tables set forth the Company’s Revenues and Segment EBITDA for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024:\n \nFor the years ended June 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\n \n \nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues\n \n \n \n \nCable Network Programming\n$\n6,930 \n$\n5,955 \n$\n975 \n16 \n%\nTelevision\n9,325 \n7,875 \n1,450 \n18 \n%\nCorporate and Other\n244 \n209 \n35 \n17 \n%\nEliminations\n(199)\n(59)\n(140)\n**\nTotal revenues\n$\n16,300 \n$\n13,980 \n$\n2,320 \n17 \n%\n \nFor the years ended June 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\nBetter/(Worse)\nSegment EBITDA\n \n \nCable Network Programming\n$\n3,030 \n$\n2,693 \n$\n337 \n13 \n%\nTelevision\n945 \n506 \n439 \n87 \n%\nCorporate and Other\n(351)\n(316)\n(35)\n(11)\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(a)\n$\n3,624 \n$\n2,883 \n$\n741 \n26 \n%\n**\nnot meaningful\n(a)\nFor a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted EBITDA, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nCable Network Programming\n (43% of the Company’s revenues in fiscal 2025 and 2024)\n \nFor the years ended June 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues\nAffiliate fee\n$\n4,316 \n$\n4,188 \n$\n128 \n3 \n%\nAdvertising\n1,531 \n1,262 \n269 \n21 \n%\nOther\n1,083 \n505 \n578 \n**\nTotal revenues\n6,930 \n5,955 \n975 \n16 \n%\nOperating expenses\n(3,275)\n(2,668)\n(607)\n(23)\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n(635)\n(610)\n(25)\n(4)\n%\nAmortization of cable distribution investments\n10 \n16 \n(6)\n(38)\n%\nSegment EBITDA\n$\n3,030 \n$\n2,693 \n$\n337 \n13 \n%\n**\nnot meaningful\nRevenues at the Cable Network Programming segment increased $975 million or 16% for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and other revenues. Affiliate fee revenue increased $128 million or 3% as higher average rates per subscriber were partially offset by a decrease in the average number of subscribers. The increase of $269 million or 21% in advertising revenue was primarily due to \n38\nhigher news pricing and audiences and higher news digital advertising revenue. The increase of $578 million in other revenues was primarily due to higher sports sublicensing revenue.\nCable Network Programming Segment EBITDA increased $337 million or 13% for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased $607 million or 23% primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs driven by higher college football costs, including licensing costs for rights that are sublicensed, partially offset by the absence of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association Women’s \nWorld Cup \nand the Union of European Football Associations \nEuropean Championship\n in the current year. Also contributing to this increase was higher newsgathering costs primarily due to the 2024 presidential election. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $25 million or 4% principally due to higher employee costs.\nTelevision\n (57% and 56% of the Company’s revenues in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively)\n \nFor the years ended June 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues\nAdvertising\n$\n5,334 \n$\n4,182 \n$\n1,152 \n28 \n%\nAffiliate fee\n3,340 \n3,136 \n204 \n7 \n%\nOther\n651 \n557 \n94 \n17 \n%\nTotal revenues\n9,325 \n7,875 \n1,450 \n18 \n%\nOperating expenses\n(7,308)\n(6,372)\n(936)\n(15)\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n(1,072)\n(997)\n(75)\n(8)\n%\nSegment EBITDA\n$\n945 \n$\n506 \n$\n439 \n87 \n%\nRevenues at the Television segment increased $1.5 billion or 18% for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, due to higher advertising, affiliate and other revenues. The increase of $1.2 billion or 28% in advertising revenue was primarily due to the impact related to sports programming led by revenues from the broadcast of \nSuper Bowl\n \nLIX\n in February 2025 and higher pricing. Also contributing to this increase was the impact of higher political advertising revenue due to the 2024 presidential and congressional elections predominantly at the Company’s owned and operated television stations and continued digital growth led by the Tubi AVOD service. The increase of $204 million or 7% in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber partially offset by a lower average number of subscribers at the Company’s owned and operated television stations and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network. The increase of $94 million or 17% in other revenues was primarily due to higher content revenue.\nTelevision Segment EBITDA increased $439 million or 87% for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased $936 million or 15% primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs driven by higher NFL costs, including the broadcast of \nSuper Bowl\n \nLIX\n in February 2025, partially offset by the absence of WWE. Also contributing to this increase was higher digital content costs and entertainment programming rights amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $75 million or 8% primarily due to higher employee costs.\n39\nCorporate and Other\n \nFor the years ended June 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in millions, except %)\nBetter/(Worse)\nRevenues\n$\n244 \n$\n209 \n$\n35 \n17 \n%\nOperating expenses\n(82)\n(56)\n(26)\n(46)\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n(513)\n(469)\n(44)\n(9)\n%\nSegment EBITDA\n$\n(351)\n$\n(316)\n$\n(35)\n(11)\n%\nRevenues within Corporate and Other for fiscal 2025 and 2024 include revenues generated by Credible and the operation of the FOX Studio Lot. Operating expenses for fiscal 2025 and 2024 include advertising and promotional expenses at Credible. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2025 and 2024 primarily relate to employee costs, professional fees and the costs of operating the FOX Studio Lot.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters, Equity earnings (losses) of affiliates, Interest expense, net, Non-operating other, net and Income tax expense.\nManagement believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company’s Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect Net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company’s business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors’ data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).\nAdjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n40\nFiscal 2025 versus Fiscal 2024\nThe following table reconciles Net income to Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024:\n \nFor the years ended June 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n \n(in millions) \nNet income\n$\n2,293 \n$\n1,554 \nAdd\nAmortization of cable distribution investments\n10 \n16 \nDepreciation and amortization\n385 \n389 \nRestructuring, impairment and other corporate matters\n350 \n67 \nEquity losses of affiliates\n29 \n44 \nInterest expense, net\n227 \n216 \nNon-operating other, net\n(438)\n47 \nIncome tax expense\n768 \n550 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n3,624 \n$\n2,883 \nThe following table sets forth the computation of Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024:\n \nFor the years ended June 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n \n(in millions) \nRevenues\n$\n16,300 \n$\n13,980 \nOperating expenses\n(10,518)\n(9,089)\nSelling, general and administrative\n(2,168)\n(2,024)\nAmortization of cable distribution investments\n10 \n16 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n3,624 \n$\n2,883 \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCurrent Financial Condition\nThe Company has approximately $5.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025 and an unused five-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (See Note 9—Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements). The Company also has access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions. As of June 30, 2025, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under its revolving credit facility, and it does not anticipate any noncompliance with such covenants.\nThe principal uses of cash that affect the Company’s liquidity position include the following: the acquisition of rights and related payments for entertainment and sports programming; operational expenditures including production costs; marketing and promotional expenses; expenses related to broadcasting the Company’s programming; employee and facility costs; capital expenditures; acquisitions, including redeemable noncontrolling interests; income taxes, interest and dividend payments; debt repayments; legal settlements; and stock repurchases.\nIn addition to the transactions disclosed within Note 3—Acquisitions, Disposals, and Other Transactions to the accompanying Financial Statements, the Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the Company’s securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness.\n41\nSources and Uses of Cash—Fiscal 2025 vs. Fiscal 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2025 and 2024 was as follows (in millions):\nFor the years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n3,324 \n$\n1,840 \nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, was primarily due to higher Segment EBITDA, principally due to higher political advertising receipts from the 2024 presidential and congressional elections along with receipts from \nSuper Bowl\n \nLIX\n in February 2025, partially offset by higher content payments.\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2025 and 2024 was as follows (in millions):\nFor the years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(537)\n$\n(452)\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, was primarily due to the fiscal 2025 acquisitions (See Note 3—Acquisitions, Disposals, and Other Transactions to the accompanying Financial Statements), partially offset by a decrease in the Company’s investments and capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2025 and 2024 was as follows (in millions):\nFor the years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(1,755)\n$\n(1,341)\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities during fiscal \n2025, as compared to fiscal 2024,\n \nwas primarily due to the net impact of the October 2023 issuance of $1.25 billion of senior notes and the repayment of $1.25 billion and $600 million of senior notes that matured in January 2024 and April 2025, respectively (See Note 9—Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements).\nStock Repurchase Program\nSee Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Stock Repurchase Program.”\nDividends\nDividends paid in fiscal \n2025\n totaled $0.54 per share of FOX’s \nClass A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class B Common Stock” and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Common Stock”)\n. Subsequent to \nJune 30, 2025\n, the Company declared a semi-annual dividend of $0.28 per share on both the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock. The dividend declared is payable on September 24, 2025 with a record date for determining dividend entitlements of September 3, 2025.\nBased on the number of shares outstanding as of \nJune 30, 2025\n, and the new annual dividend rate stated above, the total aggregate cash dividends expected to be paid to stockholders in fiscal \n2026\n is approximately $250 million.\n42\nDebt Instruments\nThe following table summarizes cash (used in) repayment of borrowings and cash from borrowings for fiscal 2025 and 2024:\nFor the years ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nBorrowings \nNotes due 2025 and 2024\n(a)\n$\n(600)\n$\n(1,250)\nNotes due 2033\n(b)\n— \n1,232 \nTotal borrowings\n$\n(600)\n$\n(18)\n(a)\nIn April 2025 and January 2024, $600 million of 3.050% senior notes and $1.25 billion of 4.030% senior notes matured and were repaid in full, respectively (See Note 9—Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements).\n(b)\nSee Note 9—Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading \"Public Debt - Senior Notes Issued.\"\nRatings of the Senior Notes\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s credit ratings as of June 30, 2025:\nRating Agency\nSenior Debt\nOutlook\nMoody’s\nBaa2\nStable\nStandard & Poor’s\nBBB\nStable\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into an unsecured $1.0 billion revolving credit facility\n with a maturity date of June 2028 (See Note 9—Borrowings to the accompanying Financial Statements).\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements (“firm commitments”) to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. For additional details on commitments and contingencies see Note 14—Commitments and Contingencies to the accompanying Financial Statements under the headings “Licensed Programming,” “Other commitments and contractual obligations” and “Contingencies.”\nPension and other postretirement benefits and uncertain tax benefits \nThe table in Note 14—Commitments and Contingencies to the accompanying Financial Statements excludes the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefits (“OPEB”) obligations and the gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing. The Company made contributions of $40 million and $86 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. The majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funded status of the plans. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, interest rates and statutory requirements. Assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the Company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2026 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant, the Company would not be required to make any material contributions to its pension plans for the immediate future. Required pension plan contributions for the next fiscal year are not expected to be material but the Company may make voluntary contributions in future periods. Payments due to participants under the Company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. Payments due under the Company’s OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the Company’s OPEB plans. The Company does not expect its net OPEB payments to be material in fiscal 2026 (See Note 15—Pension and \n43\nOther Postretirement Benefits to the accompanying Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and OPEB plans).\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been determined by management of the Company and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. For the Company’s summary of significant accounting policies, see Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nSee Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Use of Estimates.”\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers the terms of each arrangement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment. Significant judgments used in revenue recognition include the identification of performance obligations and the allocation of consideration, including those contracts containing bundled advertising sales or licenses.\nThe Company generates advertising revenue from sales of commercial time within the Company’s network programming, and from sales of advertising on the Company’s owned and operated television stations and various digital properties. Advertising revenue from customers is recognized as the commercials are aired. Certain of the Company’s advertising contracts have guarantees of a certain number of targeted audience views, referred to as impressions, where the performance obligation is the guarantee and revenue is recognized as the guarantee is satisfied. For contracts without guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated based on relative standalone selling price. Advertising contracts, which are generally short-term, are billed monthly for the spots aired during the month, with payments due shortly thereafter.\nThe Company generates affiliate fee revenue from agreements with MVPDs for cable network programming and for the broadcast of the Company’s owned and operated television stations. In addition, the Company generates affiliate fee revenue from agreements with independently owned television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network and receives retransmission consent fees from MVPDs for their signals. Affiliate fee revenue is recognized as the Company satisfies the performance obligation by continuously making the network programming available to the customer over the term of the agreement. For contracts with affiliate fees based on the number of the affiliate’s subscribers, revenues are recognized based on the contractual rate multiplied by the estimated number of subscribers each period. For contracts with fixed affiliate fees, revenues are recognized based on the relative standalone selling price of the network programming provided over the contract term, which generally reflects the invoiced amount. Affiliate contracts are generally multi-year contracts billed monthly with payments due shortly thereafter.\nInventories\nLicensed and Owned Programming\nThe Company incurs costs to license programming rights and to produce owned programming. Licensed programming includes costs incurred by the Company for access to content owned by third parties. The Company has single and multi-year contracts for sports and non-sports programming. Licensed programming is recorded at the earlier of payment or when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is known or reasonably determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. Advances paid for the right to broadcast sports events within one year and programming with an initial license period of one year or less are classified as current inventories included within Inventories, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and license fees for programming with an initial license period of greater than one year are classified as non-current \n44\ninventories included within Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Licensed programming is predominantly amortized as the associated programs are made available over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. The costs of multi-year sports contracts are primarily amortized based on the ratio of each contract’s current period attributable revenue to the estimated total remaining attributable revenue. Estimates can change and, accordingly, are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary. Such changes in the future could be material.\nOwned programming, included within Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, includes content internally developed and produced as well as co-produced content. Capitalized costs for owned programming, including direct costs, production overhead and development costs, are predominantly amortized using the individual-film-forecast-computation method, which is based on the ratio of current period revenue to estimated total future remaining revenue, and related costs are expensed as incurred. Future remaining revenue includes imputed license fees for content used by FOX as well as revenue expected to be earned based on distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content. Changes to estimated future revenues may result in impairments or changes in amortization patterns. When production partners distribute owned programming on the Company’s behalf, the net participation in profits is recorded as content license revenue. Projects in-process are written off at the earlier of abandonment or three years after initial capitalization.\nInventories are evaluated for recoverability when an event or circumstance occurs that indicates that fair value may be less than unamortized costs. The Company will determine if there is an impairment by evaluating the fair value of the inventories, which are primarily supported by internal forecasts as compared to unamortized costs. Where an evaluation indicates unamortized costs, including advances on multi-year sports rights contracts, are not recoverable, amortization of rights is accelerated in an amount equal to the amount by which the unamortized costs exceed fair value. Owned programming is predominantly monetized and tested for impairment on an individual basis. Licensed programming is predominantly monetized as a group and tested for impairment on a channel, network, or daypart basis. The recoverability of certain sports rights is assessed on an aggregate basis. The Company recognized impairments of approximately $40 million, $40 million, and $10 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to owned programming at the Television segment, which were recorded in Operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe Company’s intangible assets include goodwill, Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) licenses, MVPD affiliate agreements and relationships, software and trademarks and other copyrighted products.\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets acquired, based on their respective estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the consideration transferred to acquire entities and the estimated fair values assigned to their tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, long-term growth rates, asset lives, market multiples and relevant comparable transactions, among other items. Identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income. The Company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method.\nCarrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment. The Company’s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation approach that requires significant management judgment. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired and require the Company to perform an interim impairment test.\n45\nThe direct valuation method used for FCC licenses requires, among other inputs, the use of published industry data that is based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the Company owns television stations. This method also involves the use of management’s judgment in estimating appropriate terminal growth rates, operating margins and discount rates reflecting the risk of a market participant in the broadcast industry. The resulting fair values for FCC licenses are sensitive to these long-term assumptions and any adverse changes to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material.\nDuring fiscal 2025, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge for intangible assets of approximately $70 million primarily related to FCC licenses in Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations within the Television segment. Based on the Company’s annual assessment, the carrying value of FCC licenses in certain markets exceeded their fair value primarily as a result of updated market data, including lower expected future advertising revenue. Additionally, the fair value of FCC licenses in certain markets exceeded their respective carrying value by less than 10% as of June 30, 2025. An increase to the discount rate of 0.5 percentage points, or a decrease to the terminal growth rate of 0.5 percentage points, assuming no changes to other long-term assumptions, would cause the aggregate fair value of FCC licenses to fall below the aggregate carrying value by approximately $80 million and $50 million, respectively. Further adverse changes in market conditions may result in additional non-cash impairment charges.\nDuring fiscal 2025, the Company determined that the goodwill included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2025 was not impaired based on the Company’s annual assessment and there are no reporting units at risk of impairment. While the Company believes its judgments represent reasonably possible outcomes based on available facts and circumstances, adverse changes to the assumptions, including prevailing market conditions, discount rates, competitive factors, comparable public company trading values and expected future cash flows, could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units and potentially result in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in future periods. The Company will continue to monitor its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for any possible future non-cash impairment charges.\nSee Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Annual Impairment Review” for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income tax primarily in various domestic jurisdictions. The Company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties.\nThe Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the Company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income.\nEmployee Costs\nThe Company participates in and/or sponsors various pension, savings and postretirement benefit plans. Pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are closed to new participants with the exception of a small group covered by collective bargaining agreements. The measurement and recognition of costs of the Company’s pension and OPEB plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions.\nFor financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate, an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in \n46\nmaking these assumptions. The expected long-term rate of return is determined using the current target asset allocation of 22% equity securities, 71% fixed income securities and 7% in other investments, and applying expected future returns for the various asset classes and correlations amongst the asset classes. A portion of the fixed income investments is allocated to cash to pay near-term benefits.\nThe discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments on the Company’s annual measurement date of June 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The rate was determined by matching the Company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of hundreds of high-quality corporate bonds.\nThe key assumptions used in developing the Company’s fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 net periodic pension expense for its plans consist of the following:\n \n2025\n2024\n2023\n \n(in millions, except %)\nDiscount rate for service cost\n5.5 \n%\n5.3 \n%\n4.8 \n%\nDiscount rate for interest cost\n5.3 \n%\n5.4 \n%\n4.5 \n%\nAssets\nExpected rate of return\n5.6 \n%\n5.3 \n%\n5.0 \n%\nActual return\n$\n54 \n$\n45 \n$\n53 \nExpected return\n50 \n45 \n40 \nActuarial gain\n$\n4 \n$\n— \n$\n13 \nDiscount rates are volatile from year to year because they are determined based upon the prevailing rates as of the measurement date. The Company will utilize discount rates of 5.6% and 5.0% in calculating the fiscal 2026 service cost and interest cost, respectively, for its plans. The Company will use an expected long-term rate of return of 5.9% for fiscal 2026 based principally on the future return expectation of the plans’ asset mix. Changes in assumptions and differences between assumptions and actual experience has resulted in accumulated pre-tax net losses on the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans, which as of June 30, 2025 were $170 million as compared to $139 million as of June 30, 2024. These deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense. Unrecognized losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants or average future life of the plan participants.\nThe Company made contributions of $40 million, $86 million and $53 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. Assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the Company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2026 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant, the Company would not be required to make any material statutory contributions to its pension plans for the immediate future. The Company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status.\nChanges in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the Company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. The following table \n47\nhighlights the sensitivity of the Company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:\nChanges in Assumption\nImpact on Annual\nPension Expense\nImpact on PBO\n0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate\nIncrease $3 million\nIncrease $28 million\n0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate\nDecrease $3 million\nDecrease $26 million\n0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets\nIncrease $2 million\n—\n0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets\nDecrease $2 million\n—\nFiscal 2026 net periodic pension expense for the Company’s pension plans is expected to be approximately $35 million, consistent with the amount recognized in fiscal 2025.\nLegal Matters\nThe Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims and indemnification claims when the Company determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Any fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlements which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various proceedings could affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. See Note 14—Commitments and Contingencies to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading “Contingencies” for a discussion of the Company’s legal proceedings.\nCAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
