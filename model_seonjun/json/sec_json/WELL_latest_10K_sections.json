  "item1": "Item 1.\n Business\n \nGeneral\nWelltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, is driving the transformation of healthcare infrastructure. The company invests with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall healthcare experience. Welltower\n™\n, a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), owns interests in properties concentrated in major, high-growth markets in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), consisting of seniors housing, post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties. More information is available on the Internet at www.welltower.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT, or \"UPREIT,\" under which substantially all of our business is conducted through Welltower OP LLC (\"Welltower OP\"), the day-to-day management of which is exclusively controlled by Welltower Inc.\nOur primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and healthcare real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.\nWelltower Inc. is the initial member and majority owner of Welltower OP, with an approximate ownership interest of 99.707% as of December 31, 2024. Welltower Inc. issues equity from time to time, the net proceeds of which it is obligated to contribute as additional capital to Welltower OP. All debt including credit facilities, senior notes and secured debt is incurred by Welltower OP or its subsidiaries and Welltower Inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all existing and future senior unsecured notes.\nUnless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to \"Welltower\" mean Welltower Inc. and references to \"Welltower OP\" mean Welltower OP LLC. References to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean collectively Welltower, Welltower OP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Welltower and/or Welltower OP.\nPortfolio of Properties\nPlease see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Executive Summary – Company Overview” for a table that summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2024.\nProperty Types\nWe invest in seniors housing and healthcare real estate and evaluate our business through three reportable segments: Seniors Housing Operating, Triple-net and Outpatient Medical. For additional information regarding our segments, please see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of our various property types. \nSeniors Housing Operating\nOur Seniors Housing Operating properties include seniors apartments, independent living and independent supportive living, continuing care retirement communities, assisted living, Alzheimer's/dementia care and include care homes with or without nursing (U.K.), which assist with activities of daily living that preserve a person's mobility and social systems to promote cognitive engagement. Our properties include stand-alone properties that provide one level of service, combination properties that provide multiple levels of service and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of services. Properties are often held in joint venture entities with operating partners. We utilize the structure authorized by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (\"RIDEA\"), which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure. \nSeniors Apartments \nSeniors apartments generally refer to age-restricted or age-targeted multi-unit housing with self-contained living units for older adults, usually aged 55+ who are able to care for themselves. Seniors apartments generally do not offer other additional services such as meals.\nIndependent Living and Independent Supportive Living (Canada)\n  Independent living and independent supportive living generally refers to age-restricted, multifamily properties with central dining that provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation, social and recreational activities. \nContinuing Care Retirement Communities \n Continuing care retirement communities typically include a combination of detached homes and properties offering independent living, assisted living and/or long-term/post-acute care services on one campus. These communities appeal to residents because there is no need to relocate when health and medical needs change. Resident payment plans vary, but can include entrance fees, condominium fees and rental fees. Many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health services. \nAssisted Living \n Assisted living refers to state-regulated rental properties that provide independent living services, but also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require assistance with activities of daily living, including, but not limited to, management of medications, bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating and eating.\n2\nAlzheimer’s/Dementia Care \n Alzheimer's/Dementia Care refers to state-regulated rental properties that generally provide assisted living and independent living services, but also provide supportive care to residents with memory loss, Alzheimer's disease and/or other types of dementia. Amenities vary, but may include enhanced security, specialized design features and memory-enhancing therapies that promote relaxation and help slow cognitive decline.\nCare Homes with or without Nursing (U.K.) \n Care homes without nursing, regulated by the Care Quality Commission (\"CQC”), are rental properties that provide essentially the same services as U.S. assisted living. Care homes with nursing, also regulated by the CQC, are licensed daily rate or rental properties where most individuals require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for various national and local reimbursement programs. Unlike the U.S., care homes with nursing in the U.K. generally do not provide post-acute care.\nOur Seniors Housing Operating segment accounted for 76%, 72% and 72% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had relationships wit\nh 53\n partners to manage our Seniors Housing Operating properties. In each instance, our partner provides management services to the properties pursuant to an incentive-based management contract. We rely on our partners to manage these properties effectively and efficiently. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Sunrise Senior Living, Cogir Management Company and Oakmont Management Group accounted for 13%, 11% and 11% of Seniors Housing Operating Segment revenues.\nTriple-net\nOur Triple-net properties offer services including independent living and independent supportive living (Canada), assisted living, continuing care retirement communities, Alzheimer's/dementia care and care homes with or without nursing (U.K.) described above, as well as long-term/post-acute care. Our properties include stand-alone properties that provide one level of service, combination facilities that provide multiple levels of service and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of services. We invest primarily through acquisitions, development and joint venture partnerships. \nOur properties are primarily leased to operators under long-term, triple-net master leases that obligate the tenant to pay all operating costs, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance costs and all obligations under certain ground leases. In addition, such triple-net master leases often require our tenants to fund a minimum amount related to capital expenditures. The leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 10 to 20 years and contain one or more five to 15-year renewal options. Certain of our leases also contain purchase options, a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full market value if the options were to be exercised. Substantially all these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators are generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. We are not involved in property management.\nLong-Term/Post-Acute Care Facilities \n Post-acute care is at the leading edge of reducing healthcare costs while improving quality. These high-impact centers help patients recover from illness or surgery with the goals of getting the patient home and healed faster and reducing hospital readmission rates. Our long-term/post-acute care properties generally offer skilled nursing/post-acute care, inpatient rehabilitation and long-term acute care services. Skilled nursing/post-acute care refers to licensed daily rate or rental properties where most individuals require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement in the U.S. or provincial reimbursement in Canada. All properties offer some level of rehabilitation services. Some properties focus on higher acuity patients and offer rehabilitation units specializing in cardiac, orthopedic, dialysis, neurological or pulmonary rehabilitation. Inpatient rehabilitation properties provide intensive inpatient services after illness, injury, or surgery to patients able to tolerate and benefit from three hours of rehabilitation per day. Long-term acute care properties provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than is available in most skilled nursing/post-acute care properties.\nAt December 31, 2024, approximately 96% of our triple-net properties were subject to master leases. A master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement. From time to time, we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease. The tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease. Typically, the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time. We believe this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to poorer performing properties. This spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease. The bundling feature should provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy. Subject to certain restrictions, a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject its unexpired leases and executory contracts. In the context of integrated master leases such as ours, our tenants in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole, rather than deciding on a property by property basis. \nOur Triple-net segment accounted for 10%, 13% a\nnd \n13%\n \nof total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively\n. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our revenues related to our relationship with Integra Healthcare Properties (\"Integra\") accounted for approximately \n27%\n of our Triple-net segment revenues and \n3%\n of total revenues.\n3\nOutpatient Medical\nOutpatient Medical Buildings\n  Demand for outpatient medical services is growing as more procedures are performed safely and efficiently outside the hospital setting. State-of-the-art outpatient centers are needed in accessible, consumer-friendly locations. Our portfolio of outpatient medical buildings is an integral part of creating healthcare provider connectivity in local markets and generally include physician offices, ambulatory surgery centers, diagnostic facilities, outpatient services and/or labs. Approximately 88% of our outpatient medical building portfolio is affiliated with health systems (buildings directly on or adjacent to hospital campuses or with tenants that are satellite locations for the health system and its physicians). \nOur outpatient medical portfolio is primarily self-managed and consists mainly of multi-tenant properties leased to healthcare providers. Our leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant. As of December 31, 2024, 63% of our portfolio included leases with full pass through, 30% with a partial expense reimbursement (modified gross) and 7% with no expense reimbursement (gross). Our outpatient medical leases are non-cancellable operating leases that have a weighted-average remaining term of seven years at December 31, 2024 and are often credit enhanced by security deposits, guarantees and/or letters of credit.\nOur Outpatient Medical segment accounted for 10%, 11% and 12% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No single tenant exceeds 20% of segment revenues or total revenues.\nInvestments\nProviding high-quality and affordable healthcare to an aging global population requires vast investments and infrastructure development. We invest in seniors housing and healthcare real estate primarily through acquisitions, developments and joint venture partnerships. For additional information regarding acquisition and development activity, please see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Our portfolio creates opportunities to connect partners across the continuum of care and drive efficiency. We seek to diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location. In determining whether to invest in a property, we focus on the following: (1) the experience of the obligor’s/partner’s management team; (2) the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property; (3) the credit of the obligor/partner; (4) the security for any lease or loan; (5) the real estate attributes of the building and its location; (6) the capital committed to the property by the obligor/partner; and (7) the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry. \nWe monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of, among other things, tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs and market conditions. \nOther Investment Types\n \nConstruction\n  We are party to agreements to develop or redevelop properties funded through capital that we and/or our joint venture partners provide. We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us. The amount capitalized is based on the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our company-wide cost of financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. The construction period commences once expenditures for the property have been made and activities necessary to get the property ready for its intended use are in progress and terminates when the applicable property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. During the construction period, we advance funds in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require, among other things, periodic site visits by a company representative. During the construction period, we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of holding back a portion of the development fee, requiring a credit support for cost-overrun obligations and/or completion guarantees. As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding construction investments of $1,219,720,000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately $540,297,000 to complete construction for consolidated investment properties. We also provide for construction loans which, depending on the terms and conditions, could be treated as loans or investments in unconsolidated entities. \nLoans\n  Our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income, principal amortization and transaction fees. Real estate loans consist of mortgage loans and other real estate loans which are primarily collateralized by a first, second or third mortgage lien, a leasehold mortgage on, or an assignment of the partnership interest in the related properties, corporate guarantees and/or personal guarantees. Non-real estate loans are generally corporate loans with no real estate backing. As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding loans, net of allowances, of $2,027,586,000 with an interest yield of approximately 10.3% per annum. Our yield on loans depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments. The loans outstanding as of December 31, 2024 are generally subject to one to 15-year terms with principal amortization schedules and/or balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term.\n4\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities \n Investments in entities that we do not consolidate but for which we can exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2024, we had investments in unconsolidated entities of $1,768,772,000. Our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10% to 95% in real estate assets. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations. The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest, inclusive of transaction costs. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based on a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded. \nIn Substance Real Estate\n Additionally, we provide loans to third parties for the acquisition, development and construction of real estate. Under these arrangements, it is possible that we will participate in the expected residual profits of the project through the sale, refinancing or acquisition of the property. We evaluate the characteristics of each arrangement, including its risks and rewards, to determine whether they are more similar to those associated with a loan or an investment in real estate. Arrangements with characteristics implying real estate joint ventures are treated as in substance real estate investments, accounted for using the equity method and are presented as investments in unconsolidated entities. We have made loans related t\no 25 properties with a carrying value of $941,216,000\n as of December 31, 2024, which are classified as in substance real estate investments.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control, through voting rights or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nAt inception of joint venture transactions, we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”) and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, \"Consolidations,\" requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a VIE will need to be consolidated. This evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance.\nFor investments in joint ventures, U.S. GAAP may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances based on the type of rights held by the limited partner(s). We assess the limited partners’ rights and their impact on our consolidation conclusions and we reassess if there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests, or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. We similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies.\nBorrowing Policies\nWe utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments. For short-term purposes, we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility or issue commercial paper. We typically replace these borrowings with long-term capital such as senior unsecured notes or common stock. When terms are deemed favorable, we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. In addition, we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. In certain agreements with our lenders, we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness.\nCompetition\nWe compete with other real estate investment trusts, real estate partnerships, private equity and hedge fund investors, banks, insurance companies, finance/investment companies, government-sponsored agencies, taxable and tax-exempt bond funds, healthcare operators, developers and other investors in the acquisition, development, leasing and financing of healthcare and seniors housing properties. We compete for investments based on a number of factors including relationships, certainty of execution, investment structures and underwriting criteria. Our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends, availability of acceptable investment opportunities, our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs and applicable laws and regulations.\nThe operators/tenants of our properties compete with properties that provide comparable services in the local markets. Operators/tenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of properties, location, services offered, family preferences (including a preference for home health services instead of residing in one of our communities), physicians, staff and price. We also face competition from other healthcare facilities for tenants, such as physicians and other healthcare providers that provide comparable facilities and services.\n5\nFor additional information on the risks associated with our business, please see “Item 1A — Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSustainability\nSustainability Approach \nWe strive to operate in a responsible, transparent and sustainable manner. Our leadership, through the cross-functional Sustainability Steering Committee and the Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), through the Nominating Corporate/Governance Committee, oversees and advances our sustainability initiatives. Our corporate responsibility and sustainability strategy is focused on adopting leading sustainability practices across our business and we were recognized for our leadership in this space over the past year in the following ways:\n•\nAchieved a MSCI ESG (\"Environmental, Social and Governance\") rating of AA;\n•\nRecognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Energy as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year for the sixth consecutive year and maintained the level of Sustained Excellence, the EPA’s highest recognition within the ENERGY STAR program, for the fourth consecutive year;\n•\nMaintained top 30% (3rd decile) ISS Quality Score ranking for each of Environment and Social\n•\nNamed to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the sixth consecutive year;\n•\nMaintained Prime status under the ISS-ESG Corporate Rating for the sixth consecutive year;\n•\nMaintained GRESB Green Star status for the fourth consecutive year; and\n•\nRecognized for industry-leading governance practices, including #1 ranking from Green Street Advisors for Corporate Governance amongst all US REITs.\nWe are committed to operating in a sustainable manner that helps to reduce our environmental impact. Our goal is prudent environmental stewardship with a focus on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, water usage and waste production; mitigating climate-related risks; and implementing energy efficiency, water efficiency and renewable energy technologies across our portfolio. We work with our stakeholders, including employees, vendors, operators, residents and tenants, in an effort to meet these objectives by encouraging and following evolving practices of environmental sustainability, including benchmarking our portfolio in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, obtaining green building certifications, implementing energy efficient technologies and performing portfolio-wide physical and transition risk analyses to identify opportunities to help mitigate these risks. \nOur sustainability team is focused on investing in property improvement projects which meet the various objectives of our stakeholders, including providing an appropriate risk-adjusted return. The sustainability team is embedded within our asset management team, enabling them to create project scopes and specifications for energy saving component replacements and upgrades within our normal replacement schedules and when the economic benefits of the additional investment is optimized. Our review and approval process of these projects is stringent and includes using the actual meter readings and/or specialized equipment to estimate and later track the water and energy savings of the work completed. \nIn the past, we have also issued \"green\" bonds to fund green building development projects. \nWe value and are committed to our employees. We believe that a diverse workplace promotes equal opportunity, produces a variety of perspectives, motivates employees and helps us understand and better serve our stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. As of December 31, 2024, our U.S. employees self-identified as follows: \nEthnicity\nMale\nFemale\nAsian\n9 \n%\n11 \n%\nBlack or African American\n5 \n%\n9 \n%\nHispanic or Latino\n12 \n%\n11 \n%\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\n— \n%\n— \n%\nTwo or More Races\n3 \n%\n2 \n%\nWhite\n71 \n%\n67 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nGender \n54 \n%\n46 \n%\nAmong other things, we support seven employee network groups (\"ENGs\") including women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, young professionals and those who identify as LGBTQI+ and their allies. Our ENGs provide support, education, networking opportunities and community belonging for our employees. These efforts support our ability to compete for and foster talent in an ever-changing workforce. \nIn addition, we have several social initiatives in place that are focused on, among other things, engaging with our communities and promoting the health and well-being of our employees, tenants and residents. The Welltower Charitable Foundation (the \"Foundation\") financially supports charitable initiatives related to aging, healthcare, the environment, education and the arts. We encourage our employees to give back to the community by matching their contributions and donating their time to eligible charitable organizations. Funds are also allocated to each of our ENGs to make charitable contributions in support of their programming efforts. The Welltower Charitable Foundation will provide a 100% match of \n6\nemployee donations to verified 501(c)(3) organizations, up to $2,500 per employee per calendar year. Additionally, the Foundation facilitates presentations for charities to compete in the Give-WELL campaign. This campaign enables our employees to present and vote for charities that will receive donations from the Foundation. During 2024, we sponsored our fifth annual Day of Giving so our employees could collaborate to make an impact with local charitable organizations through volunteer opportunities. See \"Human Capital\" below for additional information regarding our employee initiatives and programs.\nWe believe that our Board is highly knowledgeable, skilled and independent, with eight of our nine directors being independent. As of December 31, 2024, our \nnine\n Directors self-identified as follows:\nBoard Composition\nEthnicity\nGender\nAsian\n11 \n%\nMale\n67 \n%\nBlack or African American\n22 \n%\nFemale\n33 \n%\nHispanic or Latino\n22 \n%\n100 \n%\nWhite\n45 \n%\n100 \n%\nAdditional information regarding our sustainability programs and initiatives is available in our 2023 Sustainability Report (located on our website at www.welltower.com). Information on our website, including our Sustainability Report or sections thereof, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\nHuman Capital\nOur employees are our greatest asset. As of December 31, 2024, we had 685 employees (653 located in U.S., 20 in the U.K. and 12 in Canada). We are committed to the success of our people and the unique combination of skills and experiences they bring to achieving our mission. \nStrategic Growth Through Career Development and Workforce Planning\n In 2024, we made significant investments in career-pathing tools and workforce planning systems. We implemented company-wide skills maps, talent planning and review tools and a headcount and staffing planning system. These initiatives enabled us to strategically scale our organization and its people capabilities, while aligning individual goals with broader business objectives. Additionally, we enhanced our development programs by providing coaching, e-learning, job assessments, individual development plans and skills-based development tools. These tools support our employees' career growth and the development of future leaders.\nDriving Performance Excellence and Empowering Leaders \nWe continued to invest in technology to help our team operate efficiently while servicing a larger workforce. Investments include standardizing policies and procedures, growing our internal Human Capital team and providing development opportunities for our Human Capital professionals. We also streamlined our performance management practices, creating more rigorous connections between performance and compensation. This approach fosters a culture of rewards and recognition, driving accountability and high performance.\nTo enhance people leadership capabilities, we launched an industry-first, AI-based manager development program, offering managers real-world, situational training in a safe simulated environment to make mistakes, learn and grow. This program strengthens leadership decision-making and fosters a culture of continuous improvement.\nCultural Development \n We remain committed to creating an inclusive and respectful workplace culture that employees value and contribute to. In 2024, we continued to provide our civil treatment and inclusive workplace training programs for leaders and employees. These efforts reinforce our mission to build an environment where everyone feels valued and supported.\nAdditionally, we conducted an organizational effectiveness survey to better understand how the Human Capital team can more effectively support our leaders and teams. Insights from this survey are being used to refine our strategies and enhance our ability to meet the evolving needs of our workforce.\nCompensation and Benefits \nWe are dedicated to offering compensation and benefits to attract and retain top talent. In 2024, we conducted a company-wide survey to assess employee benefits preferences. Based on these results, we enhanced our benefits offerings, furthering our commitment to providing industry-leading benefits that are important to our employees. Programs offered include healthcare and insurance benefits, retirement programs with robust matching programs, an employee stock purchase program, tuition assistance, paid leave policies, health navigation support, enhanced mental health support and wellness initiatives, among many others. \nHealth, Safety and Wellness\n The health, safety and well-being of our employees remain a top priority. In 2024, we introduced additional wellness programs, expanded ENG initiatives and implemented additional wellness platforms such as family planning support. We also rolled out enhanced leave policies designed to help employees integrate work and life responsibilities more effectively.\n7\nWe have transitioned to a four-day in-office workweek to foster collaboration, while continuing to support a geographically dispersed workforce. Our robust internal communications strategy, combined with our intranet serving as a digital headquarters, ensures employees remain connected to the business and leadership regardless of location. Key communication tools such as podcasts, town hall meetings and employee engagement events further reinforce this connectivity.\nCredit Concentrations \n Please see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nGeographic Concentrations \n Please see “Item 2 – Properties” below and Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCertain Government Regulations\nUnited States\nHealth Law Matters — Generally\nTypically, operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws, as opposed to federal laws. Operators of long-term/post-acute care facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to extensive regulation, including federal and state laws covering the type and quality of medical and/or nursing care provided, ancillary services (\ne.g\n., respiratory, occupational, physical and infusion therapies), qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment, reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies. In addition, as described below, operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the federal Stark Law (“Stark Law”) and the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), as well as comparable state laws. Hospitals, physician group practice clinics and other healthcare providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, registration, certification and inspection laws, regulations and industry standards, as well as other conditions of participation in federal and state government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Further, operators of long-term care facilities are required to have in place compliance and ethics programs that meet the requirements of federal laws and regulations. Our tenants’ failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in, among other things: loss of accreditation; denial of reimbursement; imposition of fines; suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs; loss of license; or closure of the facility. See risk factors “The requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us” and “Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, local and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us” in “Item 1A – Risk Factors” below. Moreover, in light of certain arrangements that we may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare, and, given that certain of our arrangements are structured under the provisions of RIDEA, certain healthcare fraud and abuse laws and data privacy laws could apply directly to Welltower. See risk factor \"We assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in RIDEA structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition\" in \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" below.\nLicensing and Certification\nThe primary regulations that affect seniors housing facilities are state licensing and certification laws. For example, certain healthcare facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need (“CON”) laws and regulations. Where applicable, CON laws generally require, among other requirements, that a facility demonstrate the need for (1) constructing a new facility, (2) adding beds or expanding an existing facility, (3) investing in major capital equipment or adding new services, (4) changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or (5) terminating services that have been previously approved through the CON process. Certain state CON laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services. In addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator.\nWith respect to licensure, generally our seniors housing and long-term/post-acute care facilities are required to be licensed by the applicable state-regulatory authority. The failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property and could result in suspension of new admissions or loss of licensure. Our entities are named on licenses for nearly all of the RIDEA portfolio and the loss of a license for one facility can require reporting in other jurisdictions. \nReimbursement\nThe reimbursement methodologies applied to healthcare facilities continue to evolve. Federal and state authorities have considered and implemented and may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies, including value-based reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact healthcare property operations. Likewise, third-party payors may continue imposing greater controls on operators, including through changes in reimbursement rates and fee structures. The impact of any such changes, if implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio. No assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that \n8\npayments under a government healthcare program are currently, or will be in the future, sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses.\n•\nSeniors Housing Facilities\n  The majority of the revenues received by the operators of U.S. seniors housing facilities are from private pay sources. The remaining revenue source is primarily Medicaid provided under state waiver programs for home and community-based care. There can be no guarantee that a state Medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status. Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs. Generally, facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a Medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care. The level of Medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state. Thus, the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix, acuity level or changes in Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels.\n•\nLong-Term/Post-Acute Care Facilities\n  The majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors and patients. Consequently, changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses, including our rent or debt service. Long-term/post-acute care facilities are subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities. A review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments, denials or delay of payments in the future. Due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting, no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors.\n◦\nMedicare Reimbursement \nGenerally, long-term/post-acute care facilities are reimbursed by Medicare under prospective payment systems, which generally provide reimbursement based on a predetermined fixed amount per episode of care and are updated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) annually. There is a risk under these payment systems that costs will exceed the fixed payments, or that payments may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services. The HHS Office of Inspector General (\"OIG\") has released recommendations to address skilled nursing facility (\"SNF\") billing practices and Medicare payment rates, which may impact our tenants and operators. In June 2023, CMS began publishing additional information regarding Medicare-certified nursing homes with common owners and operators, referred to as “affiliated entities,” including names of affiliated owners and aggregate data on the safety, staffing and quality of affiliated entities. This information makes it easier for stakeholders (such as state licensing officials, state and federal law enforcement and researchers) and the public to identify common owners of nursing homes across different nursing home locations. The information also allows for greater accessibility to information regarding facilities' performance and any common ownership links among facilities with poor performance. CMS has also increased scrutiny and oversight over the country's poorest performing nursing facilities through the Special Focus Facility Program, now publishing monthly updates to its Special Focus Facility List, which highlights facilities with a history of serious quality of care issues, and is increasing enforcement actions against facilities that fail to demonstrate improvement, including denial of payment and potential loss of Medicare certification.\n◦\nMedicaid Reimbursement\n  Many states reimburse SNFs using fixed daily rates, which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care. In most states, Medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing services. Certain states are attempting to slow the rate of Medicaid growth by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if state revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures.\n◦\nSkilled Nursing Facility and Nursing Facility Compliance Program Guidance\n In November 2024, OIG published industry segment-specific compliance program guidance for Skilled Nursing Facilities and Nursing Facilities to develop, implement and maintain effective compliance and quality programs, identify and mitigate risks, ensure compliance with federal regulations and improve the quality of care and safety for residents. This is the first of a series of compliance program guidance that OIG plans to issue for different healthcare sectors and reflects OIG’s findings and observations from its work on matters involving nursing facilities as well as its current enforcement priorities and stakeholder interactions. The guidance identifies key risk areas for the industry, including a detailed, industry-specific discussion of eight AKS risk areas for nursing facilities and provides recommendations for minimizing conflicts of interest in nursing facility pharmaceutical decisions. \n◦\nHealth Reform Laws \nCertain health reform measures could be implemented as a result of political, legislative, regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. On April 22, 2024, as part of President Biden’s nursing home reform initiative, CMS issued a Final Rule establishing minimum staffing standards for long-term care facilities, specifically Medicare SNFs, Medicaid nursing facilities (“NFs”) and dually certified facilities. The Final Rule requires a registered nurse to be on site 24 hours per day and seven days per week to provide skilled nursing care to all residents, with exemptions in certain circumstances and CMS has begun to publish minimum staffing standard facility compliance determinations on the Medicare.gov website. Over the next ten years, CMS estimates that implementation of the Final Rule will cost long-term care facilities a total of $43 billion. CMS also continues to require the disclosure of certain ownership and managerial information regarding Medicare SNFs and Medicaid NFs, \n9\nincluding updates to identify REIT ownership of SNFs. We cannot predict whether the existing Health Reform Laws, the results of the 2024 Presidential and Congressional elections and potential subsequent developments, or future healthcare reform legislation, executive orders or regulatory changes, will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business. In addition, on June 28, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion holding that courts reviewing agency action pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act “must exercise their independent judgment” and “may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous.” The decision will have a significant impact on how lower courts evaluate challenges to agency interpretations of law, including those by the CMS and other agencies with significant oversight of the healthcare industry. The new framework is likely to increase both the frequency of such challenges and their odds of success by eliminating one way in which the government previously prevailed in such cases. As a result, significant regulatory policies may be subject to increased litigation and judicial scrutiny. Any resulting changes in regulation may result in unexpected delays, increased costs or other negative impacts on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business that are difficult to predict.\n•\nMedicare Reimbursement for Physicians, Hospital Outpatient Departments (“HOPDs”) and Ambulatory Surgical Centers (“ASCs”)\n Changes in reimbursement to physicians, HOPDs and ASCs may further affect our tenants and operators. Generally, Medicare reimburses physicians under the Physician Fee Schedule, while HOPDs and ASCs are reimbursed under prospective payment systems. The Physician Fee Schedule and the HOPD and ASC prospective payment systems are updated annually by CMS. These annual Medicare payment regulations have resulted in lower net pay increases than providers of those services have often expected. In addition, the Medicare and Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) includes payment reductions for providers who do not meet government quality standards. The implementation of pay-for-quality models like those required under MACRA, has the potential to produce funding disparities that could adversely impact some provider tenants in outpatient medical buildings and other healthcare properties. Changes in Medicare Advantage plan payments may also indirectly affect our operators and tenants that contract with Medicare Advantage plans.\nFraud & Abuse Enforcement\nLong-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. Certain of these laws, such as the AKS and Stark Law, prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government healthcare programs. Other government health program laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service. Our operators and tenants that receive payments from federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, are subject to substantial financial penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the FCA upon a finding of noncompliance with such laws. In July 2024, CMS issued a Final Rule that revises CMS’ enforcement authority for imposing civil money penalties (“CMPs”) and strengthens nursing home enforcement regulations. The Final Rule specifically expands the number and types of CMPs that CMS can impose on long-term care facilities, including allowing (i) more per-instance (“PI”) CMPs to be imposed in conjunction with per-day CMPs, (ii) multiple PI CMPs when the same type of noncompliance is identified on more than one day and (iii) CMS or individual states to impose a CMP for the number of days of previously cited noncompliance since the last three standard surveys for which a CMP has not yet been imposed to ensure that identified noncompliance may be subject to a penalty.  In addition, states may also have separate false claims acts, which, among other things, generally prohibit healthcare providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payments. Federal and state FCAs contain \"whistleblower\" provisions that permit private individuals to bring healthcare fraud enforcement claims on behalf of the government. Still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety, health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for violations of these laws, regulations and other applicable guidance may include, but are not limited to, criminal and/or civil penalties and fines, loss of licensure, immediate termination of government payments, exclusion from any government healthcare program, damage assessments and imprisonment. In certain circumstances, violation of these rules (such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior) with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions, including exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as other government healthcare programs and revocation of healthcare licenses. In the ordinary course of its business, a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations.\nProsecutions, investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity, financial condition and operations, which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us. In addition, government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the healthcare industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue. The costs for an operator of a healthcare property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us. In addition, we could potentially be directly subject to these healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as well as potential investigation or enforcement, as a result of our RIDEA-structured arrangements and certain collaboration or other arrangements we may pursue with stakeholders who are directly subject to these laws.\n10\nFederal and State Data Privacy and Security Laws\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection, security, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of personal information, including individually identifiable health information. Violations of these laws may result in regulatory scrutiny, lawsuits or substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties, including regulatory consent orders. The costs to a business such as ours or to an operator of a healthcare property associated with developing and maintaining programs and systems to comply with data privacy and security laws, defending against privacy and security related claims or enforcement actions and paying any assessed fines, can be substantial. Moreover, such costs could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us. Finally, data privacy and security laws and regulations continue to develop, including with regard to HIPAA and U.S. state privacy laws governing consumer personal data and consumer health data. Comprehensive consumer data privacy laws in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia are in effect. Consumer health data-focused privacy laws, such as the Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada's consumer health data privacy law, are also in effect. Further state comprehensive consumer data privacy laws will become effective over the course of 2025 and beyond. Furthermore, many states have introduced legislation that would revise or implement new such laws, and many states have promulgated regulations, which continue to evolve, to implement existing legislation. As we use data to better inform our investments and the efficacy of care in our communities, these developments may add potential uncertainty and costs towards compliance obligations, business operations or transactions that depend on data. These evolving privacy laws may create restrictions or requirements in our, our operators' and other business partners' use, sharing and retention of data. New privacy and security laws could require substantial investment in resources to comply with regulatory changes as privacy and security laws proliferate in divergent ways or impose additional obligations and potentially create new privacy related legal risks.\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the U.K., care home services are principally regulated by the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (as amended) and other regulations including the Health and Care Act 2022 and the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) (Amendment) Regulations 2023. This legislation subjects service providers to a number of legally binding “Fundamental Standards” and requires, among other things, that all persons carrying out “Regulated Activities” in the U.K., and the managers of such persons, be registered. Providers of care home services are also subject (as data controllers) to laws governing their use of personal data (including in relation to their employees, clients and recipients of their services). These laws currently take the form of the U.K.’s Data Protection Act 2018 and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (collectively “U.K. DP Laws”). U.K. DP Laws impose a significant number of obligations on controllers with the potential for fines of up to 4% of annual worldwide turnover or £17.5 million, whichever is greater. Further, entities may also be subject to the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\"E.U. GDPR\"). Similarly, the E.U. GDPR imposes obligations on controllers with the potential for fines of up to 4% of annual worldwide turnover or €20 million, whichever is greater. The U.K. DP Laws may be subject to change with the introduction of the Data Use and Access  (\"DUA\") Bill in 2024. Entities incorporated in or carrying on a business in the U.K., as well as individuals residing in the U.K., are also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. The U.K. has national minimum wage legislation with a maximum fine for non-payment of £20,000 per worker and employers who fail to pay will be banned from being a company director for up to 15 years. \nCanada\nSenior living residences in Canada are provincially regulated. Within each province, there are different categories for senior living residences that are generally based on the level of care sought and/or required by a resident (e.g. assisted or retirement living, senior living residences, residential care or long-term care). In some of these categories and depending on the province, residences may be government funded, or the individual residents may be eligible for a government subsidy, while other residences are exclusively private pay. The governing legislation and regulations vary by province, but generally the object of the laws is to set licensing requirements and minimum standards for senior living residences and regulate operations. These laws empower regulators in each province to take a variety of steps to ensure compliance, conduct inspections, issue reports and generally regulate the industry. \nOur operations in Canada are subject to privacy legislation, including, in certain provinces, privacy laws specifically related to personal health information. Although the obligations of senior living residences in the various provinces differ, they all include the obligation to protect personal information. Under some of these laws, notification to the regulator in the event of an actual or suspected privacy breach is mandatory. The powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts. In September 2021, the province of Quebec adopted significant amendments to its privacy legislation (each of which are now in effect), including a new enforcement scheme with significant penalties and fines: up to CAD $10 million or 2% of global turnover (whichever is greater) for administrative monetary penalties and up to CAD $25 million or 4% of global turnover for penal fines. Senior living residences may also be subject to laws pertaining to residential tenancy, provincial and/or municipal laws applicable to fire safety, food services, zoning, occupational health and safety, public health and the provision of community healthcare and funded long-term/post-acute care.\n11\nTaxation\nThe following summary of the taxation of the Company and the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to the holders of the equity of the Company and the debt securities of the Company and Welltower OP is for general information only and is not tax advice. This summary does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to certain types of holders of stock or securities (including, but not limited to, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers, persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging, integrated conversion, or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, investors in pass-through entities and non-U.S. corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the U.S.).\nThis summary does not discuss all of the aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular investment or other circumstances. In addition, this summary does not discuss any state or local income taxation or non-U.S. income taxation or other non-U.S. tax consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal income tax laws. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including changes in law or differing interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our securities as set forth in this summary. Before you purchase our securities, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. and other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling our securities.\nGeneral\nPrior to the reorganization on April 1, 2022, whereby the company formerly known as Welltower Inc. (\"Old Welltower\"), became a wholly owned subsidiary of WELL Merger Holdco Sub Inc. in a transaction intending to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In connection with the Reorganization, Old Welltower changed its name to Welltower OP Inc., WELL Merger Holdco Sub Inc. changed its name to Welltower Inc. and Old Welltower became a “qualified REIT subsidiary” of the Company. Effective on May 24, 2022, Welltower OP Inc. converted from a Delaware corporation into a Delaware limited liability company named Welltower OP LLC. Prior to the Reorganization, Old Welltower elected to be taxed as a REIT and was organized and operated in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT. As a result of the reorganization, the Company is treated as a continuation of Old Welltower for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe have been organized and operated in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT, but there can be no assurance that we will qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. Qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under U.S. federal income tax law with respect to our income, assets, distributions and share ownership, as discussed below under “Qualification as a REIT.”\nIn any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders. We may, however, be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net capital gain, stockholders would be taxed on their proportionate shares of our undistributed net capital gain and would receive a refundable credit for their shares of any taxes paid by us on such gain.\nDespite qualifying as a REIT, we may be subject to U.S. federal income and excise tax as follows:\n•\nTo the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates;\n•\nIf we have net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, such income will be taxed at the highest corporate rate;\n•\nAny net income from prohibited transactions (which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than dispositions of foreclosure property) will be subject to a 100% tax;\n•\nIf we fail to satisfy either the 75% or 95% gross income tests (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (1) the gross income attributable to the greater of (i) 75% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% gross income test (discussed below) or (ii) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test (discussed below) multiplied by (2) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability;\n•\nIf we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year, (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year (other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on) and (3) any undistributed taxable income from preceding years, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed; and\n12\n•\nWe will be subject to a 100% tax on certain amounts from certain transactions involving our “taxable REIT subsidiaries” that are not conducted on an arm’s length basis. See “Investments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.”\nWe have acquired assets from “C” corporations in carryover basis transactions and may do so again in the future. A “C” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level U.S. federal income tax. If we recognize gain on the disposition of such assets during the five-year period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us, then, to the extent of the assets’ “built-in gain” (e.g., the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis of the asset, in each case determined as of the beginning of the five-year period), we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable. The results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of built-in gain assume that the “C” corporation did not make and was not treated as making an election to treat the built-in gain assets as sold to an unrelated party on the date they were acquired by us. For our assets that are subject to the built-in gains tax, the potential amount of built-in gains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of such assets within the five-year period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the built-in gains tax.\nQualification as a REIT\nA REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or association:\n(1) which is managed by one or more trustees or directors;\n(2) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;\n(3) which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the U.S. federal income tax law relating to REITs;\n(4) which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company;\n(5) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in each taxable year of the REIT except for its first\n    taxable year;\n(6) not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year, excluding its first taxable year, directly, indirectly or constructively, by or for five or fewer individuals (which includes certain entities) (the “Five or Fewer Requirement”); and\n(7) which meets certain income and asset tests described below.\nConditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met during the entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. For purposes of condition (6), pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are treated as individuals, subject to a “look-through” exception in the case of certain pension funds.\nBased on publicly available information, we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in (5) and (6) above. In addition, Article VI of our by-laws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares. These restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in (5) and (6) above but may not ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to satisfy such requirements.\nWe have complied with, and will continue to comply with, tax regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock. If, despite sending the annual letters, we do not know, or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, whether we failed to meet the Five or Fewer Requirement, we will be treated as having met the Five or Fewer Requirement. If we fail to comply with these tax regulatory rules, we will be subject to a monetary penalty. If our failure to comply were due to intentional disregard of the requirement, the penalty would be increased. However, if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalty would be imposed.\nFor purposes of the REIT income and asset tests our assets and income will include any asset owned and any income earned directly or indirectly through a disregarded entity, including a “qualified REIT subsidiary,” and a proportionate share of the assets of, and any income earned through, any entity we own that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including Welltower OP. A corporation will qualify as a “qualified REIT subsidiary” if 100% of its stock is owned by a REIT, and the REIT does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary. \nWe will own substantially all of our assets and earn substantially all of our income through Welltower OP and its direct or indirect subsidiaries. Prior to the LLC Conversion, Welltower OP was treated as a “qualified REIT subsidiary,” provided that we qualified as a REIT during this period. After the LLC Conversion, Welltower OP became a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes and was treated as a disregarded entity until additional regarded members were admitted to Welltower OP, at which time Welltower OP became a regarded entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \nAlthough we intend for any partnership in which we have acquired or will acquire an interest, directly or indirectly (a “Subsidiary Partnership”), to operate in a manner consistent with the requirements for our qualification as a REIT, we will be an indirect limited partner or non-managing member in some of the Subsidiary Partnerships. Though we nonetheless expect that \n13\nall such Subsidiary Partnerships will be required to operate in a manner consistent with the requirements for our qualification as a REIT, if a Subsidiary Partnership in which we own an interest but do not have control takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our status as a REIT or require us to pay tax, we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity. In addition, it is possible that a Subsidiary Partnership could take an action which could cause us to fail a gross income or asset test and that we would not become aware of such action in time for us to dispose of our interest in the Subsidiary Partnership or take other corrective action on a timely basis. In that case, we could fail to qualify as a REIT unless we were able to qualify for a statutory REIT “savings” provision, which could require us to pay a significant penalty tax to maintain our REIT qualification.\nIncome Tests\n  There are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy each taxable year:\n•\nAt least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) generally must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real property,” dividends or other distributions on, and gain (other than gain from prohibited transactions) from the sale or other disposition of, REIT shares, mortgages on real property, other income from investments relating to real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments (the “75% gross income test”).\n•\nAt least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) generally must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75% gross income test and from dividends (including dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries) and interest (the “95% gross income test”).\nIncome from hedging and non-U.S. currency transactions is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests if certain requirements are met but otherwise will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95% or 75% gross income tests.\nRents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a REIT only if several conditions are met:\n•\nThe amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales.\n•\nRents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT, directly or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant, unless the tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented.\n•\nIf rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property.”\n•\nFor rents to qualify as rents from real property, we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants, other than through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom we derive no income, except that we may directly provide services that are usually or customarily rendered in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only or are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant for the occupant’s convenience.\n•\nWe may lease “qualified healthcare properties” on an arm’s-length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person that qualifies as an “independent contractor” and that is, or is related to a person that is, actively engaged in the trade or business of operating healthcare facilities for any person unrelated to us or our taxable REIT subsidiary (such person, an “eligible independent contractor”). If this is the case, the rent that the REIT receives from the taxable REIT subsidiary generally will be treated as “rents from real property.” A “qualified healthcare property” includes any real property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility that extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and is operated by a provider of such services that is eligible for participation in the Medicare program with respect to such facility.\nA REIT is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants of a property and still treat rents received with respect to that property as rent from real property. The amount received or accrued by the REIT during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by the REIT directly or indirectly from the property. The amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150% of the direct cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation. Furthermore, impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary subject to certain conditions, which would permit us to still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property.\n14\nThe term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales or by reason of being based on the income or profits of a debtor which derives substantially all of its income with respect to the property securing such debt from the leasing of substantially all of such property to tenants, to the extent that the rents paid by the tenants would qualify as rents from real property if the Company earned such amounts directly.\nIf we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for such year if we are eligible for certain relief provisions provided by the Code. These relief provisions generally will be available if (1) following our identification of the failure, we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income, and (2) the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is imposed on an amount equal to (1) the gross income attributable to (i) 75% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and (ii) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test, multiplied by (2) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. The Secretary of the Treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify under the 75% and 95% gross income tests and to exclude items from the measure of gross income for such purposes.\nAsset Tests\n  Within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets (including interests in real property, interests in mortgages on real property or on interests in real property, shares in other REITs and debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs), cash, cash items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation), government securities and qualified temporary investments (the “75% asset test”). Although the remaining 25% of our assets generally may be invested without restriction, we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10% of either the vote (the “10% vote test”) or value (the “10% value test”) of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Further, no more than 20% of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (the “20% asset test”) and no more than 5% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any non-governmental issuer (the “5% asset test”) other than a qualified REIT subsidiary, another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test and the 20% and 5% asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter. There are special rules which provide relief if the value-related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a REIT.\nCertain items are excluded from the 10% value test, including: (1) straight debt securities meeting certain requirements; (2) any loan to an individual or an estate; (3) any rental agreement described in Section 467 of the Code, other than with a “related person”; (4) any obligation to pay rents from real property; (5) certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, a non-U.S. government, or any political subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; (6) any security issued by a REIT; and (7) any other arrangement that, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, is excepted from the definition of security (“10% Value Excluded Securities”). If a REIT, or its taxable REIT subsidiary, holds (1) straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and (2) securities of such issuer that are not 10% Value Excluded Securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1% of such issuer’s outstanding securities, the straight debt securities will be included in the 10% value test.\nA REIT’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10% value test to securities issued by the partnership. Further, any debt instrument issued by a partnership that is not a 10% Value Excluded Security will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10% value test (1) to the extent of the REIT’s interest as a partner in the partnership or (2) if at least 75% of the partnership’s gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) would qualify for the 75% gross income test. For purposes of the 10% value test, a REIT’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the REIT’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership (other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph).\nIf a REIT or its “qualified business unit” uses a non-U.S. currency as its functional currency, the term “cash” includes such non-U.S. currency, but only to the extent such non-U.S. currency is (i) held for use in the normal course of the activities of the REIT or “qualified business unit” which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95% and 75% gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75% asset test, and (ii) not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities.\nWith respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test or the 5% asset test, a REIT may avoid disqualification as a REIT by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation due to the ownership of assets that do not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or $10,000,000, provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the REIT first identified the violation. For violations of any of the REIT asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence, a REIT can avoid disqualification as a REIT after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps, including \n15\ndisposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and filing a schedule with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") that describes the non-qualifying assets.\nInvestments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries\n REITs may own more than 10% of the voting power and value of securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries. Unlike a qualified REIT subsidiary, other disregarded entity or partnership, the income and assets of a taxable REIT subsidiary are not attributable to the REIT for purposes of satisfying the income and asset ownership requirements applicable to REIT qualification. Except as noted below with respect to a corporate entity that operates a healthcare or lodging facility, we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest, directly or indirectly, are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable REIT subsidiary.”\nCertain of our subsidiaries have elected or will elect taxable REIT subsidiary status. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level U.S. federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by REITs without jeopardizing the REIT status of their parent REIT. The taxes to which our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject will reduce the cash available for such taxable REIT subsidiaries to distribute as dividends to us.\nThe IRS may redetermine amounts from transactions between a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’s-length dealing between the parties. Any taxable income allocated to, or deductible expenses allocated away, from a taxable REIT subsidiary would increase its tax liability. Further, redetermined amounts from certain transactions involving a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiaries could be subject to a 100% tax if not conducted on an arm’s length basis.\nA taxable REIT subsidiary does not include any corporation that directly or indirectly operates or manages a lodging facility or a healthcare facility unless such facility is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person that is an independent contractor, and certain other requirements are met.  The failure of a subsidiary of ours to qualify as a taxable REIT subsidiary as a result of operating a lodging facility or a healthcare facility could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus could impair the Company’s ability to qualify as a REIT unless the Company could avail itself of certain relief provisions under the Code and pay any tax resulting therefrom.\nFor tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) imposes among other things, a 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (“Corporate AMT”) on certain U.S. corporations with average adjusted financial statement income in excess of $1 billion. Although, by its terms, the Corporate AMT is not applicable to REITs, it is not certain whether or how the Corporate AMT would apply to our TRSs.  \nThe IRS has issued several notices indicating its intention to propose regulations providing guidance regarding the Corporate AMT and issuing certain interim rules on which taxpayers may rely. Until further regulations and guidance from the IRS is released, the impact of the Corporate AMT on our TRSs is uncertain and it is possible that our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be subject to material U.S. federal income taxes under the Corporate AMT.\nInvestments in REIT Subsidiaries\n The Company, through Welltower OP, owns and may acquire direct or indirect interests in one or more entities that have elected or will elect to be taxed as REITs under the Code (each, a “Subsidiary REIT”). A Subsidiary REIT is subject to the various REIT qualification requirements and other limitations described herein that are applicable to the Company. If a Subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, then (i) that Subsidiary REIT would become subject to U.S. federal income tax and (ii) the Subsidiary REIT’s failure to qualify could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus could impair the Company’s ability to qualify as a REIT unless the Company could avail itself of certain relief provisions under the Code and pay any tax resulting therefrom.\nAnnual Distribution Requirements\n In order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to make distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to (1) the sum of (i) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the after-tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property, minus (2) a portion of certain items of non-cash income. These distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration. Prior to 2014, with respect to all REITs, the amount distributed could not be preferential. This means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class (the “preferential dividend rule”). The preferential dividend rule no longer applies to publicly offered REITs; however, the rule is still applicable to REITs which are not publicly offered, which would include several of our Subsidiary REITs. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates. As discussed above, we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements. Although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements, economic, market, legal, tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements.\n16\nIt is also possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to, among other things, (1) timing differences between (i) cash receipts and cash expenditures and (ii) the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or (2) the payment of expenditures that may not be deductible to us. In the event that timing differences occur, we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or, if possible, pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement.\nUnder certain circumstances, including in the event of a deficiency determined by the IRS, we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year. Thus, we may be able to avoid being disqualified as a REIT and/or taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends; however, we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based on the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions.\nFailure to Qualify as a REIT\n If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be deductible by us. As a result, we anticipate that our failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our stockholders. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to distribute any amounts to our stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and will not be eligible for the 20% deduction under Section 199A of the Code applicable to certain non-corporate shareholders, including individuals, prior to January 1, 2026. In such event, corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. In addition, non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, may be eligible for the preferential tax rates on qualified dividend income. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, such stockholders may not claim this deduction with respect to dividends paid by us. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief. Failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities.\nIn addition to the relief described above under “Income Tests” and “Asset Tests,” statutory relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT if: (1) the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; (2) we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each failure to satisfy the provision; and (3) the violation does not include a violation described under “Income Tests” or “Asset Tests” above. It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions.\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Holders of Our Stock and the Debt Securities of the Company and Welltower OP \nThe following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of acquiring, owning and disposing of stock of the Company or debt securities of the Company or Welltower OP. This discussion is limited to holders who hold stock of the Company or debt securities of the Company or Welltower OP as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the alternative minimum tax. In addition, except where specifically noted, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation: \n•\nU.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the U.S.; \n•\nU.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; \n•\npersons holding stock or debt securities as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment; \n•\nbanks, insurance companies and other financial institutions; \n•\nREITs or regulated investment companies; \n•\nbrokers, dealers or traders in securities; \n•\n“controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;\n•\nS corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein); \n•\ntax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations; \n•\npersons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to stock or debt securities being taken into account in an applicable financial statement; \n•\npersons deemed to sell stock or debt securities under the constructive sale provisions of the Code; and \n•\npersons who hold or receive our stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise as compensation. \n17\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED AS TAX ADVICE. INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR STOCK OR DEBT SECURITIES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS (INCLUDING ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS), UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY. \nFor purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of stock of the Company or debt securities of the Company or Welltower OP that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as:\n•\nan individual who is a citizen or resident of the U.S.; \n•\nan entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and created or organized under the laws of the U.S., any state thereof or the District of Columbia; \n•\nan estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or \n•\na trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (2) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \nFor purposes of this discussion, a “non-U.S. holder” is any beneficial owner of our stock or debt securities that is neither a U.S. holder nor an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \nIf an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our stock or debt securities, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding stock of the Company or debt securities of the Company or Welltower OP and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them. \nTaxation of Taxable U.S. Holders of Our Stock \nDistributions Generally\n Distributions out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as dividends and, other than with respect to capital gain dividends and certain amounts which have previously been subject to corporate level tax, as discussed below, will be taxable to our taxable U.S. holders as ordinary income when actually or constructively received. See “Tax Rates” below. As long as we qualify as a REIT, these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction in the case of U.S. holders that are corporations or, except to the extent described in “Tax Rates” below, the preferential rates on qualified dividend income applicable to non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals. For purposes of determining whether distributions to holders of our stock are out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, our earnings and profits will be allocated first to our outstanding preferred stock, if any, and then to our outstanding common stock. \nTo the extent that we make distributions on our stock in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to such stock, these distributions will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to a U.S. holder to the extent of the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares of stock. This treatment will reduce the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares of stock by such amount, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and in excess of a U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares will be taxable as capital gain. Such gain will be taxable as long-term capital gain if the shares have been held for more than one year. Dividends we declare in October, November, or December of any year and which are payable to a holder of record on a specified date in any of these months will be treated as both paid by us and received by the holder on December 31 of that year, provided we actually pay the dividend on or before January 31 of the following year. U.S. holders may not include in their own income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses. \nU.S. holders that receive taxable stock distributions, including distributions partially payable in our common stock and partially payable in cash, would be required to include the full amount of the distribution (i.e., the cash and the stock portion) as a dividend (subject to limited exceptions) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as described above. The amount of any distribution payable in our common stock generally is equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of the common stock. Depending on the circumstances of a U.S. holder, the tax on the distribution may exceed the amount of the distribution received in cash, in which case such U.S. holder would have to pay the tax using cash from other sources. If a U.S. holder sells the common stock it received in connection with a taxable stock distribution in order to pay this tax and the proceeds of such sale are less than the amount required to be included in income with respect to the stock portion of the distribution, such U.S. holder could have a capital loss with respect to the stock sale that could not be used to offset such income. A U.S. holder that receives common stock pursuant to such distribution generally has a tax basis in such common stock equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of such common stock as described above, and has a holding period in such common stock that begins on the day immediately following the payment date for the distribution. \n18\nCapital Gain Dividends\n Dividends that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to our taxable U.S. holders as a gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset held for more than one year, to the extent that such gain does not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year. U.S. holders that are corporations may, however, be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income.\nRetention of Net Capital Gains\n We may elect to retain, rather than distribute as a capital gain dividend, all or a portion of our net capital gains. If we make this election, we would pay tax on our retained net capital gains. In addition, to the extent we so elect, our earnings and profits (determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) would be adjusted accordingly, and a U.S. holder generally would: \n•\ninclude its pro rata share of our undistributed capital gain in computing its long-term capital gains in its U.S. federal income tax return for its taxable year in which the last day of our taxable year falls, subject to certain limitations as to the amount that is includable; \n•\nbe deemed to have paid its share of the capital gains tax imposed on us on the designated amounts included in the U.S. holder’s income as long-term capital gain; \n•\nreceive a credit or refund for the amount of tax deemed paid by it; and\n•\nincrease the adjusted tax basis of its stock by the difference between the amount of includable gains and the tax deemed to have been paid by it. \nIn addition, a U.S. holder that is a corporation is required to appropriately adjust its earnings and profits for the retained capital gains in accordance with Treasury Regulations. These Treasury Regulations have not yet been promulgated so the appropriate method for making such adjustment is unclear.\nPassive Activity Losses and Investment Interest Limitations\n Distributions we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange of our stock by a U.S. holder will not be treated as passive activity income. As a result, U.S. holders generally will not be able to apply any “passive losses” against this income or gain. A U.S. holder generally may elect to treat capital gain dividends, capital gains from the disposition of our stock and income designated as qualified dividend income, as described in “Tax Rates” below, as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation, but in such case, the holder will be taxed at ordinary income rates on such amount. Other distributions made by us, to the extent they do not constitute a return of capital, generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation. \nDispositions of Our Stock\n Except as described below under “Redemption or Repurchase by Us,” if a U.S. holder sells or disposes of shares of our stock, it will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received on the sale or other disposition of the shares and the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares. This gain or loss, except as provided below, will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder has held such stock for more than one year. However, if a U.S. holder recognizes a loss upon the sale or other disposition of stock that it has held for six months or less, after applying certain holding period rules, the loss recognized will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent the U.S. holder received distributions from us which were required to be treated as long-term capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nRedemption or Repurchase by Us\n A redemption or repurchase of shares of our stock will be treated under Section 302 of the Code as a distribution (and taxable as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits as described above under “Distributions Generally”) unless the redemption or repurchase satisfies one of the tests set forth in Section 302(b) of the Code and is therefore treated as a sale or exchange of the redeemed or repurchased shares. The redemption or repurchase generally will be treated as a sale or exchange if it: \n•\nis “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the U.S. holder, \n•\nresults in a “complete redemption” of the U.S. holder’s stock interest in us, or \n•\nis “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the U.S. holder, \nall within the meaning of Section 302(b) of the Code. \nIn determining whether any of these tests has been met, shares of our stock, including common stock and other equity interests in us, considered to be owned by the U.S. holder by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the Code, as well as shares of our stock actually owned by the U.S. holder, generally must be taken into account. Because the determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of Section 302(b) of the Code will be satisfied with respect to the U.S. holder depends upon the facts and circumstances at the time that the determination must be made, U.S. holders are advised to consult their tax advisors to determine such tax treatment. \nIf a redemption or repurchase of shares of our stock is treated as a distribution, the amount of the distribution will be measured by the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received. See “Distributions Generally.” A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the redeemed or repurchased shares generally will be transferred to the holder’s remaining shares of our stock, if any. If a U.S. holder owns no other shares of our stock, under certain circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of a redemption or repurchase of our stock. \n19\nIf a redemption or repurchase of shares of our stock is not treated as a distribution, it will be treated as a taxable sale or exchange in the manner described under “Dispositions of Our Stock.” \nTax Rates\n Currently, the maximum tax rate for non-corporate taxpayers for (1) long-term capital gains, including certain “capital gain dividends,” generally is 20% (although depending on the characteristics of the assets which produced these gains and on designations which we may make, certain capital gain dividends may be taxed at a 25% rate) and (2) “qualified dividend income” generally is 20%. In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income, except to the extent that certain holding period requirements have been met and the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations (such as its taxable REIT subsidiaries) or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate/REIT level (for example, if the REIT distributed taxable income that it retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year). Capital gain dividends will only be eligible for the rates described above to the extent that they are properly designated by us as “capital gain dividends.” As mentioned above, U.S. holders that are corporations may be required to treat up to 20% of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income. In addition, non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, generally may deduct up to 20% of dividends from a REIT, other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026 for purposes of determining their U.S. federal income tax (but not for purposes of the 3.8% Medicare tax), subject to certain holding period requirements and other limitations. \nTaxation of Tax-Exempt U.S. Holders of Our Stock \nDividend income from us and gain arising upon a sale of shares of our stock generally should not be unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) to a tax-exempt U.S. holder, except as described below. This income or gain will be UBTI, however, to the extent a tax-exempt U.S. holder holds its shares as “debt-financed property” within the meaning of the Code. Generally, “debt-financed property” is property the acquisition or holding of which was financed through a borrowing by the tax-exempt holder. \nFor tax-exempt U.S. holders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations or supplemental unemployment benefit trusts exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under Sections 501(c)(7), (c)(9) or (c)(17) of the Code, respectively, income from an investment in our shares will constitute UBTI unless the organization is able to properly claim a deduction for amounts set aside or placed in reserve for specific purposes so as to offset the income generated by its investment in our shares. These prospective investors should consult their tax advisors concerning these “set aside” and reserve requirements. \nNotwithstanding the above, however, a portion of the dividends paid by a “pension-held REIT” may be treated as UBTI as to certain trusts that hold more than 10%, by value, of the interests in the REIT. A REIT will not be a “pension-held REIT” if it is able to satisfy the “not closely held” requirement without relying on the “look-through” exception with respect to certain trusts or if such REIT is not “predominantly held” by “qualified trusts.” As a result of restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock contained in our charter, we do not expect to be classified as a “pension-held REIT,” and as a result, the tax treatment described above should be inapplicable to our holders. However, because our common stock is (and, we anticipate, will continue to be) publicly traded, we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case. \nTaxation of Non-U.S. Holders of Our Stock \nThe following discussion addresses the rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our stock by non-U.S. holders. These rules are complex, and no attempt is made herein to provide more than a brief summary of such rules. Accordingly, the discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation and does not address other U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences that may be relevant to a non-U.S. holder in light of its particular circumstances. We urge non-U.S. holders to consult their tax advisors to determine the impact of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax laws and any applicable tax treaty on the acquisition, ownership and disposition of shares of our stock, including any reporting requirements. \nDistributions Generally\n Distributions (including any taxable stock distributions) that are neither attributable to gains from sales or exchanges by us of U.S. real property interests (“USRPIs”) nor designated by us as capital gain dividends (except as described below) will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Such distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the distributions are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the U.S. (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the U.S. to which such dividends are attributable). Under certain treaties, however, lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from a REIT. Certain certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied for a non-U.S. holder to be exempt from withholding under the effectively connected income exemption. Dividends that are treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business generally will not be subject to withholding but will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis in the same manner as dividends paid to U.S. holders are subject to U.S. federal income tax. Any such dividends received by a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate (applicable after deducting U.S. federal income taxes paid on such effectively connected income) or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. \n20\nExcept as otherwise provided below, we expect to withhold U.S. federal income tax at the rate of 30% on any distributions made to a non-U.S. holder unless: \n(1) a lower treaty rate applies and the non-U.S. holder furnishes an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable documentation) evidencing eligibility for that reduced treaty rate; or \n(2) the non-U.S. holder furnishes an IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable documentation) claiming that the distribution is income effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s trade or business. \nDistributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a non-U.S. holder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of the holder’s stock, but rather will reduce the adjusted tax basis of such stock. To the extent that such distributions exceed the non-U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such stock, they generally will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of such stock, the tax treatment of which is described below. However, such excess distributions may be treated as dividend income for certain non-U.S. holders. For withholding purposes, we expect to treat all distributions as made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. However, amounts withheld may be refundable if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, provided that certain conditions are met.\nCapital Gain Dividends and Distributions Attributable to a Sale or Exchange of U.S. Real Property Interests\n Distributions to a non-U.S. holder that we properly designate as capital gain dividends, other than those arising from the disposition of a USRPI, generally should not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, unless: \n(1) the investment in our stock is treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the U.S. (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the U.S. to which such dividends are attributable), in which case the non-U.S. holder will be subject to the same treatment as U.S. holders with respect to such gain, except that a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also be subject to a branch profits tax of up to 30%, as discussed above; or \n(2) the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S. holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% on the non-U.S. holder’s capital gains (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of such non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. \nPursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, which is referred to as “FIRPTA,” distributions to a non-U.S. holder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of USRPIs, whether or not designated as capital gain dividends, will cause the non-U.S. holder to be treated as recognizing such gain as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Non-U.S. holders generally would be taxed at the regular rates applicable to U.S. holders, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. We also will be required to withhold and to remit to the IRS 21% of any distribution to non-U.S. holders attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of USRPIs. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax in the hands of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation. The amount withheld is creditable against the non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. However, any distribution with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market located in the U.S. is not subject to FIRPTA, and therefore, not subject to the 21% U.S. withholding tax described above, if the non-U.S. holder did not own more than 10% of such class of stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution. Instead, such distributions generally will be treated as ordinary dividend distributions and subject to withholding in the manner described above with respect to ordinary dividends. Furthermore, distributions to “qualified foreign pension funds” or entities all of the interests of which are held by “qualified pension funds” are exempt from FIRPTA. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules. \nRetention of Net Capital Gains\n Although the law is not clear on the matter, it appears that amounts we designate as retained net capital gains in respect of our stock should be treated with respect to non-U.S. holders as actual distributions of capital gain dividends. Under this approach, the non-U.S. holders may be able to offset as a credit against their U.S. federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained net capital gains and to receive from the IRS a refund to the extent their proportionate share of such tax paid by us exceeds their actual U.S. federal income tax liability. If we were to designate any portion of our net capital gain as retained net capital gain, non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the taxation of such retained net capital gain. \nSale of Our Stock\n Except as described below under “Redemption or Repurchase by Us,” gain realized by a non-U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless such stock constitutes a USRPI. In general, stock of a domestic corporation that is a “United States real property holding corporation,” or USRPHC, will constitute a USRPI. We believe that we are a USRPHC. Our stock will not, however, constitute a USRPI so long as we are a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity.” A “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” includes a REIT in which at all times during a five-year testing period less than 50% in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons, subject to certain rules. For purposes of determining whether a REIT is a \n21\n“domestically controlled qualified investment entity,” a person who at all applicable times holds less than 5% of a class of stock that is “regularly traded” is treated as a U.S. person unless the REIT has actual knowledge that such person is not a U.S. person. Because our common stock is (and, we anticipate, will continue to be) publicly traded, no assurance can be given that we are or will continue to be a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity.” \nEven if we do not qualify as a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity” at the time a non-U.S. holder sells our stock, gain realized from the sale or other taxable disposition by a non-U.S. holder of such stock would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if: \n(1) such class of stock is “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market such as the New York Stock Exchange; and \n(2) such non-U.S. holder owned, actually and constructively, 10% or less of such class of stock throughout the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or other taxable disposition or the non-U.S. holder’s holding period. \nIn addition, dispositions of our stock by “qualified foreign pension funds” or entities all of the interests of which are held by “qualified foreign pension funds” are exempt from FIRPTA. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, gain from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our stock not otherwise subject to FIRPTA will be taxable to a non-U.S. holder if either (a) the investment in our stock is treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the U.S. (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the U.S. to which such gain is attributable), in which case the non-U.S. holder will be subject to the same treatment as U.S. holders with respect to such gain, except that a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also be subject to the 30% branch profits tax (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such gain, as adjusted for certain items, or (b) the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions are met, in which case the non-U.S. holder will be subject to a 30% tax on the non-U.S. holder’s capital gains (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the U.S.), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. In addition, even if we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity, upon disposition of our stock, a non-U.S. holder may be treated as having gain from the sale or other taxable disposition of a USRPI if the non-U.S. holder (1) disposes of such stock within a 30-day period preceding the ex-dividend date of a distribution, any portion of which, but for the disposition, would have been treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI and (2) acquires, or enters into a contract or option to acquire, or is deemed to acquire, other shares of that stock during the 61-day period beginning with the first day of the 30-day period described in clause (1), unless such class of stock is “regularly traded” and the non-U.S. holder did not own more than 10% of such class of stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution described in clause (1). \nIf gain on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our stock were subject to taxation under FIRPTA or otherwise as a result of being effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the U.S., the non-U.S. holder would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return and would be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax with respect to such gain in the same manner as a taxable U.S. holder (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals). In addition, if the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our stock were subject to taxation under FIRPTA, and if shares of the applicable class of our stock were not “regularly traded” on an established securities market, the purchaser of such stock generally would be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 15% of the purchase price. \nRedemption or Repurchase by Us\n A redemption or repurchase of shares of our stock will be treated under Section 302 of the Code as a distribution (and taxable as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits) unless the redemption or repurchase satisfies one of the tests set forth in Section 302(b) of the Code and is therefore treated as a sale or exchange of the redeemed or repurchased shares. See “Redemption or Repurchase by Us” under “Taxation of Taxable U.S. Holders of Our Stock” above. Qualified shareholders and their owners may be subject to different rules and should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of such rules. If the redemption or repurchase of shares is treated as a distribution, the amount of the distribution will be measured by the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received. See “Distributions Generally” above. If the redemption or repurchase of shares is not treated as a distribution, it will be treated as a taxable sale or exchange in the manner described above under “- Sale of Our Stock.” \nTaxation of Holders of Debt Securities of the Company or Welltower OP \nThe following summary describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of debt securities of the Company or Welltower OP. This discussion assumes the debt securities will be issued with less than a statutory de minimis amount of original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the debt securities for cash at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the debt securities is sold to the public for cash). \n22\nU.S. Holders \nPayments of Interest. Interest on a debt security generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time such interest is received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \nSale or Other Taxable Disposition\n A U.S. holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a debt security. The amount of such gain or loss generally will be equal to the difference between the amount received for the debt security in cash or other property valued at fair market value (less amounts attributable to any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest to the extent not previously included in income) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the debt security. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a debt security generally will be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for the debt security. Any gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the debt security for more than one year at the time of such sale or other taxable disposition. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, generally will be taxable at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. \nNon-U.S. Holders \nPayments of Interest. Interest paid on a debt security to a non-U.S. holder that is not effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding, provided that: \n•\nthe non-U.S. holder does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock or 10% or more of the profits or capital in Welltower OP; \n•\nthe non-U.S. holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us through actual or constructive stock ownership; and \n•\neither (1) the non-U.S. holder certifies in a statement provided to the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person and provides its name and address; (2) a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’ securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business and holds the debt security on behalf of the non-U.S. holder certifies to the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that it, or the financial institution between it and the non-U.S. holder, has received from the non-U.S. holder a statement under penalties of perjury that such holder is not a U.S. person and provides the applicable withholding agent with a copy of such statement; or (3) the non-U.S. holder holds its debt security directly through a “qualified intermediary” (within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations) and certain conditions are satisfied. \nIf a non-U.S. holder does not satisfy the requirements above, such non-U.S. holder will be subject to withholding tax of 30%, subject to a reduction in or an exemption from withholding on such interest as a result of an applicable tax treaty. To claim such entitlement, the non-U.S. holder must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable documentation) claiming a reduction in or exemption from withholding tax under the benefit of an income tax treaty between the U.S. and the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. \nIf interest paid to a non-U.S. holder is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the U.S. to which such interest is attributable), the non-U.S. holder will be exempt from the U.S. federal withholding tax described above. To claim the exemption, the non-U.S. holder must furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that interest paid on a debt security is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the U.S. \nAny such effectively connected interest generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular rates. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected interest, as adjusted for certain items. \nThe certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. holders that do not timely provide the applicable withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty. \nSale or Other Taxable Disposition\n A non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a debt security (such amount excludes any amount allocable to accrued and unpaid interest, which generally will be treated as interest and may be subject to the rules discussed above in “Payments of Interest”) unless: \n•\nthe gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the U.S. to which such gain is attributable); or \n23\n•\nthe non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition and certain other requirements are met. \nGain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular rates. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain items. \nA non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on gain realized upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a debt security, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the U.S.), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. \nNon-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding \nU.S. Holders\n A U.S. holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding when such holder receives payments on stock of the Company or debt securities of the Company or Welltower OP or proceeds from the sale or other taxable disposition of such stock or debt securities (including a redemption or retirement of a debt security). Certain U.S. holders are exempt from backup withholding, including corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations. A U.S. holder will be subject to backup withholding if such holder is not otherwise exempt and: \n•\nthe holder fails to furnish the holder’s taxpayer identification number, which for an individual is ordinarily his or her social security number; \n•\nthe holder furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number; \n•\nthe applicable withholding agent is notified by the IRS that the holder previously failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends; or \n•\nthe holder fails to certify under penalties of perjury that the holder has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the IRS has not notified the holder that the holder is subject to backup withholding. \nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption. \nNon-U.S. Holders\n Payments of dividends on stock of the Company or interest on debt securities of the Company or Welltower OP generally will not be subject to backup withholding, provided the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know the holder is a U.S. person and the holder either certifies its non-U.S. status, such as by furnishing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, or otherwise establishes an exemption. However, information returns are required to be filed with the IRS in connection with any distributions on stock of the Company or interest on debt securities of the Company or Welltower OP paid to the non-U.S. holder, regardless of whether such distributions constitute a dividend or whether any tax was actually withheld. In addition, proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition of such stock or debt securities (including a retirement or redemption of a debt security) within the U.S. or conducted through certain U.S.-related brokers generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting if the applicable withholding agent receives the certification described above and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a U.S. person, or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Proceeds of a disposition of such stock or debt securities conducted through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting. \nCopies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also be made available under the provisions of an applicable treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. \nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. \nMedicare Contribution Tax on Unearned Income \nCertain U.S. holders that are individuals, estates or trusts are required to pay an additional 3.8% tax on, among other things, dividends on stock, interest on debt obligations and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or debt obligations, subject to certain limitations. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of these rules on their ownership and disposition of our stock or debt securities. \nAdditional Withholding Tax on Payments Made to Non-U.S. Accounts \nWithholding taxes may be imposed under Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (such sections commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”)) on certain types of payments made to non-U.S. financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on dividends on stock of the Company, \n24\ninterest on debt securities of the Company or Welltower OP, in each case paid to a “foreign financial institution” or a “non-financial foreign entity” (each as defined in the Code), unless (1) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations, (2) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any “substantial United States owners” (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner, or (3) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements in clause (1) above, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain “specified United States persons” or “United States owned foreign entities” (each as defined in the Code), annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the U.S. governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. \nUnder the applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of dividends on stock of the Company or interest on debt securities of the Company or Welltower OP. While withholding under FATCA would have applied also to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of stock or debt securities on or after January 1, 2019, proposed Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued. Because we may not know the extent to which a distribution is a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the time it is made, for purposes of these withholding rules we may treat the entire distribution as a dividend. \nNon-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding under FATCA to their investment in stock of the Company or debt securities of the Company or Welltower OP. \nOther Tax Consequences \nState, local and non-U.S. income tax laws may differ substantially from the corresponding U.S. federal income tax laws, and this discussion does not purport to describe any aspect of the tax laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction, or any U.S. federal tax other than income tax. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of state, local and non-U.S. tax laws with respect to our tax treatment as a REIT and on an investment in our stock or debt securities.\nIn addition, the tax laws and regulations in non-U.S. jurisdictions may impose costs and expenses on the Company, its subsidiaries and assets and investments of the Company held in non-U.S. jurisdictions (including the costs of compliance with and filings under applicable laws, rules and regulations).  The Company has substantial assets, and will likely be subject to tax, reporting, legal, regulatory, and other obligations, in the U.K. and Canada. The treatment of an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes may not be determinative of its treatment for certain state, local, or non-U.S. tax purposes. \nAdditionally, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has proposed model rules for a global minimum tax of 15% of reported profits (“Pillar 2”) that has been agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries. While the U.S. has not yet enacted rules implementing Pillar 2, both the U.K. and Canada have. Although the Pillar 2 rules can lead to additional taxes (“Pillar 2 Taxes”), including taxes on our profits in the U.S., certain parts of the Pillar 2 rules do not apply to “Real Estate Investment Vehicles” and certain of their affiliates. In the event we do not qualify as a Real Estate Investment Vehicle, or one or more of our affiliates do not qualify as a “subsidiary” that is excluded from the Pillar 2 rules, or we do not otherwise qualify for a safe harbor under the Pillar 2 rules, we or our subsidiaries may be subject to Pillar 2 Taxes. We have undertaken an initial assessment, which determined we will meet the transitional safe harbor for the year ended December 31, 2024. We will continue to evaluate the potential consequences of Pillar 2 on our longer-term financial position.\nTax Aspects of Our Investments in Welltower OP and Subsidiary Partnerships\nThe following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to our direct or indirect investments in subsidiary partnerships (including Welltower OP).  \nClassification as Partnerships\n We are required to include in our income our distributive share of Welltower OP’s and Subsidiary Partnerships’ income and are entitled to deduct our distributive share of Welltower OP’s and Subsidiary Partnerships’ losses only if the applicable partnership is classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership rather than as a corporation or association taxable as a corporation. An organization will be classified as a partnership, rather than as a corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it (1) is treated as a partnership under Treasury regulations relating to entity classification (the “check-the-box regulations”) and (2) is not a “publicly traded partnership” taxable as a corporation.\nUnder the check-the-box regulations, an unincorporated entity with at least two members may elect to be classified either as an association taxable as a corporation or as a partnership. Generally, if such an entity fails to make an election, it generally will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that Welltower OP is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nA publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). While interests in Welltower OP and Subsidiary Partnerships will not be traded on an established securities market, they could possibly be deemed to be traded on a secondary market or its equivalent due to the redemption rights enabling the limited members to dispose of their interests. A publicly traded partnership will not, however, be treated as a corporation for any taxable year if 90% or more of the partnership’s gross \n25\nincome for such year consists of certain passive-type income, including (as may be relevant here) real property rents, gains from the sale or other disposition of real property, interest and dividends (the “90% Passive Income Exception”). The income requirements applicable to us in order for us to qualify as a REIT under the Code and the definition of qualifying income under the Passive Income Exception are very similar. Although differences exist between these two income tests, we do not believe that these differences would cause Welltower OP or Subsidiary Partnerships not to satisfy the 90% Passive Income Exception applicable to publicly traded partnerships.\nIf for any reason Welltower OP or a Subsidiary Partnership were taxable as a corporation, rather than as a partnership, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our ability to qualify as a REIT could be jeopardized. See “Income Tests” and “Asset Tests.” In addition, any change in Welltower OP’s or a Subsidiary Partnership’s status for tax purposes might be treated as a taxable event, in which case we might incur tax liability without any related cash distribution. See “Annual Distribution Requirements.” Further, items of income and deduction of Welltower OP or a Subsidiary Partnership would not pass through to its members, and its members would be treated as shareholders for tax purposes. Consequently, Welltower OP or a Subsidiary Partnership would be required to pay income tax at corporate tax rates on its net income, and distributions to its members would constitute dividends that would not be deductible in computing such Welltower OP’s or Subsidiary Partnership’s taxable income.\nMembers, Not Partnership, Subject to Tax\n Except as discussed below in “Revised Partnership Audit Rules,” a partnership itself is not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Rather, we are required to take into account our allocable share of each partnership’s income, gains, losses, deductions and credits for any taxable year of the partnership ending during our taxable year, without regard to whether we have received or will receive any distribution from such partnership.\nPartnership Allocations\n Although a partnership agreement generally will determine the allocation of income and losses among partners, such allocations will be disregarded for tax purposes if they do not comply with the provisions of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder. If an allocation is not recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the item subject to the allocation will be reallocated in accordance with the partners’ interests in the partnership, which will be determined by considering all of the facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangement of the partners with respect to such item. Welltower OP’s and each Subsidiary Partnerships’ allocations of taxable income, gain and loss are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder.\nTax Allocations with Respect to Certain Properties\n Pursuant to Section 704(c) of the Code, income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership must be allocated in a manner such that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, respectively, the unrealized gain or unrealized loss associated with the property at the time of the contribution. The amount of such unrealized gain or unrealized loss is generally equal to the difference between the fair market value of contributed property at the time of contribution and the adjusted tax basis of such property at the time of contribution (a “Book-Tax Difference”). Such allocations are solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes and do not affect the book capital accounts or other economic or legal arrangements among the partners. Welltower OP’s partnership agreement requires such allocations to be made in a manner permitted under Section 704(c) of the Code.\nIn general, the members who contribute property to Welltower OP will be allocated depreciation deductions for tax purposes which are lower than such deductions would be if determined on a pro rata basis. In addition, in the event of the disposition of any of the contributed assets (including our properties) which have a Book-Tax Difference, all gain or loss attributable to such Book-Tax Difference (to the extent not previously taken into account) will generally be allocated to the contributing members, including us, and other members will generally be allocated only their share of income attributable to gain or loss, if any, occurring after such contribution. This will tend to eliminate the Book-Tax Difference over the life of Welltower OP. However, the special allocation rules of Section 704(c) do not always entirely eliminate the Book-Tax Difference on an annual basis or with respect to a specific taxable transaction such as a sale. Thus, the carryover basis of the contributed assets in the hands of Welltower OP may cause us to be allocated lower depreciation and other deductions, and possibly an amount of taxable gain in the event of a sale of such contributed assets in excess of the economic or book income allocated to us as a result of such sale.\nA Book-Tax Difference may also arise as a result of the revaluation of property owned by a partnership in connection with certain types of transactions, including in connection with certain non-pro rata contributions of assets to, or distributions of assets by, Welltower OP in exchange for, or in redemption of, interests in Welltower OP. In the event of such a revaluation, the members (including us) who were members in the partnership immediately prior to the revaluation will be required to take any Book-Tax Difference created as a result of such revaluation into account in substantially the same manner as under the Section 704(c) rules discussed above. This would result in us being allocated income, gain, loss and deduction for tax purposes in amounts different than the economic or book income allocated to us by the partnership.\nThe application of Section 704(c) to Welltower OP may cause us to recognize taxable income in excess of cash proceeds, which might adversely affect our ability to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. See “Annual Distribution Requirements.” The foregoing principles also apply in determining our earnings and profits for purposes of determining the portion of distributions taxable as dividend income. The application of these rules over time may result in a higher portion of distributions being taxed as dividends than would have occurred had we purchased the contributed or revalued assets at their agreed values.\n26\nThe IRS has issued regulations requiring partnerships to use a “reasonable method” for allocating items affected by Section 704(c) of the Code and outlining several reasonable allocation methods. We have the discretion to determine which of the methods of accounting for Book-Tax Differences (specifically approved in the Treasury regulations) will be elected with respect to any properties contributed to or revalued by Welltower OP. We have not determined which method of accounting for Book-Tax Differences will be elected for properties contributed to or revalued by Welltower OP in the future.\nBasis in Partnership Interest\n Our adjusted tax basis in a partnership interest generally is equal to:\n•\nthe amount of cash and the adjusted tax basis of any other property contributed (or deemed contributed) by us to the partnership,\n•\nincreased by our allocable share of the partnership’s income, and\n•\nreduced, but not below zero, by\n◦\nour allocable share of the partnership’s loss, and\n◦\nthe amount of cash and the basis of any property distributed (or deemed distributed) to us.\nIf the allocation of our distributive share of the partnership’s loss would reduce the adjusted tax basis of our partnership interest in the partnership below zero, the recognition of such loss will be deferred until such time as the recognition of such loss would not reduce our adjusted tax basis below zero. To the extent that the partnership’s distributions (including deemed distributions) would reduce our adjusted tax basis below zero, such distributions would constitute taxable gain to us, which could be treated as ordinary income or long-term or short-term capital gain.\nPartnership Audit Rules\n A partnership (and not its partners) must pay any “imputed underpayments,” consisting of delinquent taxes, interest and penalties deemed to arise out of an audit of the partnership, unless certain alternative methods are available, and the partnership elects to utilize them. The IRS has issued regulations providing details on many of these provisions, but it is still not entirely clear how all of these rules will be implemented. Accordingly, it is possible that in the future, we and/or any partnership in which we are a partner could be subject to, or otherwise bear the economic burden of, U.S. federal income tax, interest and penalties resulting from a U.S. federal income tax audit.\nInternet Access to Our SEC Filings\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, as well as our proxy statements and other materials that are filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are made available, free of charge, on the Internet at www.welltower.com/investors, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

Other important factors are identified in “Item 1 — Business” and “Item 1A — Risk Factors” above.\nWe are organized in an UPREIT structure. In February 2022, the company formerly known as Welltower Inc. (\"Old Welltower\") formed WELL Merger Holdco Inc. (\"New Welltower\") as a wholly owned subsidiary, and New Welltower formed WELL Merger Holdco Sub Inc. (\"Merger Sub\") as a wholly owned subsidiary. On April 1, 2022, Merger Sub merged with and into Old Welltower, with Old Welltower continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of New Welltower (the \"Merger\"). In connection with the Merger, Old Welltower's name was changed to \"Welltower OP Inc.\", and New Welltower inherited the name \"Welltower Inc.\" Effective May 24, 2022, Welltower OP Inc. converted from a Delaware corporation into Welltower OP, a Delaware limited liability company (the \"LLC Conversion\"). Following the LLC Conversion, New Welltower's business continues to be conducted through Welltower OP and New Welltower does not have substantial assets or liabilities, other than through its investment in Welltower OP.\nUnless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to \"Welltower\" mean Welltower Inc. and references to \"Welltower OP\" mean Welltower OP LLC. References to \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" mean collectively Welltower, Welltower OP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Welltower and/or Welltower OP.\nExecutive Summary\nCompany Overview\nWelltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") and S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, is driving the transformation of healthcare infrastructure. Welltower invests with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall healthcare experience. Welltower owns interests in properties concentrated in major, high-growth markets in the United States (\"U.S.\"), Canada and the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), consisting of seniors housing and post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties. \nWelltower is the initial member and majority owner of Welltower OP, with an approximate ownership interest of 99.707%\n \nas of December 31, 2024. All of our property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through Welltower OP and Welltower has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in Welltower OP. Welltower issues equity from time to time, the net proceeds of which it is obligated to contribute as additional capital to Welltower OP. All debt including credit facilities, senior notes and secured debt is incurred by Welltower OP and its subsidiaries, and Welltower has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all existing senior unsecured notes.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\n \n \nPercentage of\nNumber of\nType of Property\nNOI\n(1)\nNOI\nProperties\nSeniors Housing Operating\n$\n1,511,681 \n53.7 \n%\n1,156\nTriple-net\n748,049 \n26.6 \n%\n592\nOutpatient Medical\n556,477 \n19.7 \n%\n371\nTotals\n$\n2,816,207 \n100.0 \n%\n2,119 \n(1)\n Represents consolidated net operating income (\"NOI\") and excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities. Entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount. Non-segment/Corporate NOI, which includes the loan portfolio, is excluded. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliation.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders through annual increases in NOI and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and healthcare real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and services, interest earned on outstanding loans receivable and interest earned on short-term deposits. These items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. To the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\n52\nItem 7.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nTo mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process, including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs and market conditions, among other things. We evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.\nIn addition to our asset management and research efforts, we aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guarantees and/or letters of credit. Also, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, resident fees and services and rental income represented 75%\n and \n20% of total revenues, respectively. Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.\nOur primary sources of cash include resident fees and services revenue, rental income and interest receipts, interest earned on short-term deposits, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, issuances of debt and equity securities including through our ATM Program (as defined below), proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.\nWe also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. Our investments generate cash from NOI and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. Given the general economic conditions during 2023 and 2024, investments were generally funded proactively via issuances of common stock.\nDepending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. It is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. To the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program or issue debt or equity securities, including through our ATM Program. At December 31, 2024, we had $3,506,586,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $204,871,000 of restricted cash and $5,000,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nKey Transactions\nCapital\n  The following summarizes key capital transactions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024: \n \n•\nIn October 2024, we entered into an equity distribution agreement whereby we may offer and sell up to $5,000,000,000 of common stock, which replaced our prior equity distribution agreement dated April, 2024, allowing us to sell up to $3,500,000,000 aggregate amount of our common stock (collectively, along with other previous agreements, referred to as the \"ATM Programs\"). During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold 70,419,530 shares of common stock under our current and previous ATM Programs generating gross proceeds of approximately $7,452,108,000.\n•\nIn January 2024, we repaid our $400,000,000 4.5% senior unsecured notes at maturity. In March 2024, we repaid our $950,000,000 3.625% senior unsecured notes at maturity.\n•\nIn July 2024, we closed on an expanded $5,000,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced our $4,000,000,000 existing line of credit. The new facility is comprised of a $3,000,000,000 revolving line of credit maturing in June 2028 that can be extended for an additional year and a $2,000,000,000 revolving line of credit maturing in June 2029. The revolving lines of credit will bear interest at a borrowing rate of 0.725% over the adjusted SOFR rate and include an annual facility fee of 0.125%. \n53\nItem 7.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n•\nIn July 2024, Welltower OP issued $1,035,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.125% exchangeable senior unsecured notes maturing July 15, 2029 (the \"2029 Exchangeable Notes\") unless earlier exchanged, purchased or redeemed. The 2029 Exchangeable Notes will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year.\n•\nIn August 2024, we increased the size of the commercial paper program to $2,000,000,000.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we extinguished $450,720,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 6.13% and disposed $359,140,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 4.79%.\n•\nDuring t\nhe year ended December 31, 2024, we \nissued \n$197,930,000\n of secured debt at a blended average interest rate o\nf 4.27% and assumed $960,300,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 3.98%.\nInve\nstments\n  The following summarizes our property acquisitions and joint venture investments completed during the year ended December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\n \nProperties\nBook Amount\n(1)\nCapitalization Rates\n(2)\nSeniors Housing Operating\n198 \n$\n4,542,752 \n7.2%\nTriple-net\n52 \n1,126,492 \n8.4%\nOutpatient Medical\n1 \n46,854 \n7.7%\nTotals\n251 \n$\n5,716,098 \n7.5%\n(1)\n Represents amounts recorded in net real estate investments including fair value adjustments pursuant to U.S. GAAP.

The transactions included acquiring the remaining interests in 110 properties from Revera while simultaneously selling interest in 31 properties to Revera. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the transactions.\nDuring 2024, Welltower, which held a 25% minority interest in an existing equity method joint venture that owned 39 properties subject to triple-net leases with two tenants, acquired the remaining beneficial interest. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the transaction.\nDividends\n  Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the\n quarter ended December 31, 2024 of $0.67 per share. On March 6, 2025, we will pay our 215th consecutive quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of record on February 25, 2025.\nKey Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties\nWe utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk. Management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes.\nOperating Performance\n  We believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders (\"NICS\") as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are the most appropriate earnings measures. Other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (\"FFO\") and consolidated net operating income (\"NOI\"); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by U.S. \n54\nItem 7.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGAAP. Please refer to the section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further discussion and reconciliations. These earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. \nThe following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n972,857 \n$\n358,139 \n$\n160,568 \nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n951,680 \n340,094 \n141,214 \nFunds from operations attributable to common stockholders\n2,323,433 \n1,763,227 \n1,478,072 \nConsolidated net operating income\n3,160,907 \n2,690,219 \n2,301,845 \nCredit Strength \n We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and restricted cash. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest and secured debt principal amortization). We expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. The coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"). Please refer to the section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures. Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations and rating of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet debt to book capitalization ratio\n26.8%\n34.3%\n39.5%\nNet debt to undepreciated book capitalization ratio\n21.6%\n27.8%\n32.1%\nNet debt to enterprise ratio\n12.9%\n20.9%\n29.5%\nInterest coverage ratio\n5.39x\n3.74x\n3.73x\nFixed charge coverage ratio\n4.99x\n3.44x\n3.37x\nAdjusted interest coverage ratio\n5.34x\n3.95x\n3.94x\nAdjusted fixed charge coverage ratio\n4.95x\n3.64x\n3.56x\nConcentration Risk \n We evaluate our concentration risk in terms of NOI by property mix, relationship mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our NOI could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns. Property mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our various property types and excludes interest income earned on our loan portfolio, which is classified as Non-segment/Corporate. Relationship mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our current top five relationships. Geographic mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our current top five states (or countries outside the U.S.). \n55\nItem 7.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk by NOI for the years indicated below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(1)\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nProperty mix:\n \n \n \n \nSeniors Housing Operating\n54%\n45%\n45%\n \nTriple-net\n27%\n34%\n34%\n \nOutpatient Medical\n19%\n21%\n21%\nRelationship mix:\n \n \n \n \nCogir Management Corporation\n7%\n4%\n3%\nIntegra Healthcare Properties\n7%\n8%\n—%\n \nSunrise Senior Living\n5%\n6%\n7%\n \nAvery Healthcare\n4%\n4%\n3%\n \nOakmont Management Group\n4%\n4%\n2%\n \nRemaining\n73%\n74%\n85%\nGeographic mix:\n \n \n \n \nCalifornia\n11%\n12%\n14%\n \nUnited Kingdom\n11%\n9%\n10%\n \nFlorida\n8%\n6%\n6%\n \nTexas\n8%\n8%\n8%\n \nCanada\n6%\n6%\n6%\n \nRemaining\n56%\n59%\n56%\n(1)\n Excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities. Entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount.\nWe evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. Factors that may cause actual results to differ from expected results are described in more detail in \"Item 1 — Business — Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Item 1A — Risk Factors\" and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management regularly monitors economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends. Please refer to \"Item 1 — Business,\" \"Item 1A — Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these risk factors.\nCorporate Governance\nMaintaining investor confidence and trust is important in today's business environment. Our Board of Directors and management are strongly committed to policies and procedures that reflect the highest level of ethical business practices. Our corporate governance guidelines provide the framework for our business operations and emphasize our commitment to increase stockholder value while meeting all applicable legal requirements. These guidelines meet the listing standards adopted by the New York Stock Exchange and are available on the Internet at www.welltower.com/investors/governance. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur primary sources of cash include resident fees and services, rent and interest receipts, interest earned on short-term deposits, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are discussed in further detail below. The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n56\nItem 7.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nYear Ended\nOne Year Change\nYear Ended\nOne Year Change\nTwo Year Change\n \nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n \n \nDecember 31,\n \n \n \n \n \n2024\n2023\n$\n%\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period\n$\n2,076,083 \n$\n722,292 \n$\n1,353,791 \n187 \n%\n$\n346,755 \n$\n375,537 \n108 \n%\n$\n1,729,328 \n499 \n%\nNet cash provided from (used in):\n \nOperating activities\n2,256,421 \n1,601,861 \n654,560 \n41 \n%\n1,328,708 \n273,153 \n21 \n%\n927,713 \n70 \n%\nInvesting activities\n(5,514,681)\n(5,707,742)\n193,061 \n-3 \n%\n(3,703,815)\n(2,003,927)\n54 \n%\n(1,810,866)\n49 \n%\nFinancing activities\n4,905,351 \n5,448,647 \n(543,296)\n-10 \n%\n2,761,277 \n2,687,370 \n97 \n%\n2,144,074 \n78 \n%\nEffect of foreign currency translation\n(11,717)\n11,025 \n(22,742)\nn/a\n(10,633)\n21,658 \nn/a\n(1,084)\n10 \n%\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period\n$\n3,711,457 \n$\n2,076,083 \n$\n1,635,374 \n79 \n%\n$\n722,292 \n$\n1,353,791 \n187 \n%\n$\n2,989,165 \n414 \n%\nOperating Activities \n \nPlease see \"Results of Operations\" for discussion of net income fluctuations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, cash flows provided from operations exceeded cash distributions to stockholders.\nInvesting Activities\n  The changes in net cash provided from/used in investing activities are primarily attributable to net changes in real property investments and dispositions, loans receivable and investments in unconsolidated entities, which are summarized above in \"Key Transactions.\" Please refer to Notes 3 and \n5\n of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. The following is a summary of cash used in non-acquisition capital improvement activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n \nYear Ended\nOne Year Change\nYear Ended\nOne Year Change\nTwo Year Change\n \nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n \n \nDecember 31,\n \n \n \n \n \n2024\n2023\n$\n%\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\nNew development\n$\n827,900 \n$\n1,014,935 \n$\n(187,035)\n-18 \n%\n$\n631,737 \n$\n383,198 \n61 \n%\n$\n196,163 \n31 \n%\nRecurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions\n290,832 \n199,359 \n91,473 \n46 \n%\n198,576 \n783 \n— \n%\n92,256 \n46 \n%\nRenovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements\n566,714 \n318,323 \n248,391 \n78 \n%\n277,440 \n40,883 \n15 \n%\n289,274 \n104 \n%\nTotal\n$\n1,685,446 \n$\n1,532,617 \n$\n152,829 \n10 \n%\n$\n1,107,753 \n$\n424,864 \n38 \n%\n$\n577,693 \n52 \n%\nThe change in new development is primarily due to the number and size of construction projects ongoing during the relevant periods. Renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization.

Financing activities occurring during the year ended December 31, 2024 are summarized above in “Key Transactions.” Please also refer to Notes 10, 11 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nIn May 2023, we issued $1,035,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.75% exchangeable senior unsecured notes maturing May 15, 2028\n. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 53,300,874 shares of common stock under our ATM Programs generating gross proceeds of approximately $4,313,007,000.\nIn November 2023, we issued 20,125,000 shares of common stock generating gross proceeds of approximately $1,772,216,000.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt \nDecember 31, 2024\n, we had investments in unconsolidated entities with our ownership generally ranging from 10% to 95%.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance in all material respects with the covenants under our debt agreements. None of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged. We plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nOn April 1, 2022, Welltower and Welltower OP jointly filed with the SEC an open-ended automatic or \"universal\" shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the \"Shelf Form S-3\") covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of Welltower's debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, guarantees of debt securities issued by Welltower OP, warrants and units and Welltower OP’s debt securities and guarantees of debt securities issued by Welltower. On April 1, 2022, Welltower also filed with the SEC a registration statement in connection with its enhanced dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\") under which it may issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock. On May 3, 2023, Welltower and Welltower OP filed post-effective amendment no. 1 to the Shelf Form S-3 pursuant to which Welltower OP expressly adopted the Shelf Form S-3 as its own registration statement following its statutory conversion from a corporation to a limited liability company. As\n of February 7, 2025, 15,000,000 shares of \ncommon stock remained available for issuance under the DRIP registration statement. On October 29, 2024, Welltower and Welltower OP entered into an equity distribution agreement with (i) the sales agents and forward sellers named therein and (ii) the forward purchasers named therein relating to issuances, offers and sales from time to time of up to $5,000,000,000 aggregate amount of common stock of Welltower (together with the existing master forward sale confirmations relating thereto, the \"ATM Program\"). The ATM Program also allows Welltower to enter into forward sale agreements. A\ns of February 7, 2025, \nwe had\n $2,697,834,000 of\n remaining capacity under the ATM Program and there were no \n58\nItem 7.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\noutstanding forward sales agreements. Depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.\nIn connection with the filing of the Shelf Form S-3, Welltower also filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement that will continue an offering that was previously covered by a prior registration statement relating to the registration of up to\n 475,327 sh\nares of common stock of Welltower Inc. (the \"DownREIT II Shares\") that may be issued from time to time if, and to the extent that, certain holders of Class A units (the \"DownREIT II Units\") of HCN G&L DownREIT II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \"DownREIT II\"), tender such DownREIT II Units for redemption by the DownREIT II, and HCN DownREIT Member, LLC, a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Welltower (including its permitted successors and assigns, the \"Managing Member\"), or a designated affiliate of the Managing Member, elects to assume the redemption obligations of the DownREIT II and to satisfy all or a portion of the redemption consideration by issuing DownREIT II Shares to the holders instead of or in addition to paying a cash amount. On July 22, 2022, Welltower filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement relating to the registration of up to 300,026 shares of common stock of Welltower Inc. that may be issued from time to time if, and to the extent that, certain holders of Class A Common Units (the \"OP Units\") of Welltower OP tender the OP Units for redemption by Welltower OP, and Welltower Inc. elects to assume the redemption obligations of Welltower OP and to satisfy all or a portion of the redemption consideration by issuing shares of its common stock to the holders instead of or in addition to paying a cash amount. On October 8, 2024, Welltower filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement relating to the registration of up to 23,471,419 shares of common stock of Welltower Inc. (the \"Exchanged Shares\") that may, under certain circumstances, be issuable upon exchange of 2.750% exchangeable senior notes due 2028 or 3.125% exchangeable senior notes due 2029 of Welltower OP and the resale from time to time by the recipients of the Exchanged Shares.\nSupplemental Guarantor Information\nWelltower OP has issued the unsecured notes described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. All unsecured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Welltower, and Welltower OP is 99.707% owned by Welltower as of December 31, 2024. Effective January 4, 2021, the SEC adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements applicable to registered debt offerings that include certain credit enhancements. We have adopted these new rules, which permits subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent to omit separate financial statements if the consolidated financial statements of the parent company have been filed, the subsidiary obligor is a consolidated subsidiary of the parent company, the guaranteed security is debt or debt-like, and the security is guaranteed fully and unconditionally by the parent. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of Welltower OP have not been presented. Furthermore, Welltower and Welltower OP have no material assets, liabilities or operations other than financing activities and their investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries. Therefore, we meet the criteria in Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X to omit the summarized financial information from our disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nSummary\nOur primary sources of revenue include resident fees and services revenue, rental income, interest income and interest earned on short-term deposits. Our primary expenses include property operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. We evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our three operating segments: Seniors Housing Operating, Triple-net and Outpatient Medical. The primary performance measures for our properties are NOI and same store NOI (\"SSNOI\") and other supplemental measures include FFO and Adjusted EBITDA, which are further discussed below. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliations related to these supplemental measures. \nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023.

These write-offs relate to leases for which the collection of substantially all contractual lease payments was no longer deemed probable, \ndue primarily to agreements reached to convert Triple-net properties to Seniors Housing Operating RIDEA structures. These decreases are partially offset by acquisitions during the relevant periods.\nCert\nain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we had 64 leases with rental rate increases ranging from 0.05% to 20.05% in our Triple-net portfolio. \nInterest income primarily related to leases that were classified as sales-type leases in 2024.\nAs part of the substantial exit of the Genesis HealthCare operating relationship, which we disclosed on March 2, 2021, we transitioned the sublease of a portfolio of seven facilities from Genesis HealthCare to Complete Care Management in the second quarter of 2021. As part of the March 2021 transaction, we entered into a forward sale agreement for the seven properties valued at $182,618,000, which was expected to close when the Welltower-held purchase option became exercisable. As of March 31, 2023, the right of use assets related to the properties were $115,359,000 and were reflected as held for sale with the corresponding lease liabilities of $66,530,000 on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. \nOn May 1, 2023, we executed a series of transactions that included the assignment of the leasehold interest to a newly formed tri-party unconsolidated joint venture comprised of Aurora Health Network, Peace Capital (an affiliate of Complete Care Management) and us, and culminated with the closing of the purchase option by the joint venture. The transactions resulted in net cash proceeds to us of $104,240,000 after our retained interest of $11,571,000 in the joint venture and a gain from the loss of control and derecognition of the leasehold interest of $65,485,000, which we recorded in other income within our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the year ended December 31, 2023. \n63\nItem 7.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a summary of our SSNOI at Welltower's share for the Triple-net segment (dollars in thousands):\n \nQTD Pool\nYTD Pool\nThree Months Ended\nChange\nYear Ended\nChange\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n$\n%\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n$\n%\nSSNOI\n(1)\n$\n146,864 \n$\n141,036 \n$\n5,828 \n4.1 \n%\n$\n530,520 \n$\n508,056 \n$\n22,464 \n4.4 \n%\n(1)\n Relates to 482 properties for the QTD Pool and 450 properties for the YTD Pool.

Changes in the gain on sales of properties are related to the volume and timing of property sales and the sales pri\nces, which are further discussed in\n Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest expense represents secured debt interest expense and related fees. The change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in interest rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations.

Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If the Consumer Price Index does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Our leases could renew above or below current rental rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our consolidated Outpatient Medical portfolio signed 384,643 square feet of new leases and 1,992,131 square feet of renewals. The weighted average term of these leases was eight years, with a rate of $42.22 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $30.50 per square foot. Substantially all of these leases contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from 2.0% to 6.5%. \nThe fluctuations in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions that occurred during 2023 and 2024.

The change in interest expense on our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes. Please refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. Loan expenses represent the amortization of costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured notes issuances. \nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were 2.95%\n, \n2.70% and 2.57%, respectively. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily driven by compensation costs associated with increased employee headcount. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we also recognized $29,838,000 as a cumulative catch up of stock compensation expense due to the change in the probability of achievement of specific performance goals related to special nonrecurring performance-based stock option and restricted stock awards granted in December 2021 and January 2022. Please refer to Note 15 for additional information related to these grants. \nOther expenses includes noncapitalizable legal expenses. The provision for income taxes primarily relates to state taxes, foreign taxes and taxes based on income generated by entities that are structured as taxable REIT subsidiaries. \nLoss (gain) on derivatives and financial instruments, net is primarily attributable to the mark-to-market of the equity warrants received as part of the HC-One Group transactions that closed in 2021 and 2023. \nOther\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders, as defined by U.S. GAAP, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider FFO, NOI, SSNOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (\"FFO\") as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means NICS, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and acquisitions of controlling interests, and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.\nNOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining, and servicing tenants for our properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to managers, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent general overhead costs that are unrelated to property operations and unallocable to the properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits related to corporate employees, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. Same store NOI (\"SSNOI\") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. We believe the drivers of property level NOI for both consolidated properties and unconsolidated properties are generally the same and therefore, we evaluate SSNOI based on our ownership interest in each property (\"Welltower Share\"). To arrive at Welltower's Share, NOI is adjusted by adding our minority ownership share related to unconsolidated properties and by subtracting the minority partners' noncontrolling ownership interests for consolidated properties. We do not control investments in unconsolidated properties and while we consider disclosures at Welltower Share to \n67\nItem 7.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nbe useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution. As used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. Acquisitions and development conversions are included in SSNOI five full quarters or eight full quarters after acquisition or being placed into service for the QTD Pool and the YTD Pool, respectively. Land parcels, loans and leased properties, as well as any properties sold or classified as held for sale during the respective periods are excluded from SSNOI. Redeveloped properties (including major refurbishments of a Seniors Housing Operating property where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more or Outpatient Medical properties undergoing a change in intended use) are excluded from SSNOI until five full quarters or eight full quarters post completion of the redevelopment for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. Properties undergoing operator transitions and/or segment transitions are also excluded from SSNOI until five full quarters or eight full quarters post completion of the transition for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. In addition, properties significantly impacted by force majeure, acts of God, or other extraordinary adverse events are excluded from SSNOI until five full quarters or eight full quarters after the properties are placed back into service for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. SSNOI excludes non-cash NOI and includes adjustments to present consistent ownership percentages and to translate Canadian properties and U.K. properties using a consistent exchange rate. We believe NOI and SSNOI provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and SSNOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.\nEBITDA is defined as earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding unconsolidated entities and including adjustments for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, gains/losses on disposition of properties and acquisitions of controlling interests, impairment of assets, gains/losses on derivatives and financial instruments, other expenses, other impairment charges and other adjustments as deemed appropriate. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, along with net income, are important supplemental measures because they provide additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. We primarily use these measures to determine our interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges include total interest and secured debt principal amortization. Covenants in our unsecured senior notes and primary credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA that is specific to those agreements. Our leverage ratios are defined as the proportion of net debt to total capitalization and include book capitalization, undepreciated book capitalization and enterprise value. Book capitalization represents the sum of net debt (defined as total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash), total equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization. Enterprise value represents book capitalization adjusted for the fair market value of our common stock. \nOur supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, the Board of Directors utilizes these measures to evaluate management performance. None of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.\n68\nItem 7.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe table below reflects the reconciliation of FFO to NICS, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented.

Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future. However, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Please refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.\n74\nItem 7.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table presents information about our critical accounting policies and estimates:\nNature of Critical\nAccounting Estimate\nAssumptions/Approach\nUsed\nImpairment of Real Property Owned and Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nAssessing impairment of real property owned and investments in unconsolidated entities involves subjectivity in determining if indicators of impairment are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of an asset. The evaluation of indicators of impairment is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an unfavorable change in the operating performance of the property, a change in management's intent to hold and operate the property or a change in the property's use. If an indicator of impairment of the property is identified, management estimates whether the carrying value is recoverable using observable and unobservable inputs such as historical and forecasted cash flows and estimated capitalization rates, all of which are affected by our expectations of future market or economic conditions. These inputs can have a significant impact on the undiscounted cash flows. \nThe evaluation of indicators of impairment of investments in unconsolidated entities is dependent on a number of factors including the performance of each investment, a change in market conditions or a change in management's investment strategy. When required, we estimate the fair value of an investment and, if such fair value is lower than carrying value, assess whether any impairment is other-than-temporary using observable and unobservable inputs such as historical and forecasted cash flows and estimated capitalization rates. These inputs can have a significant impact on the calculation of the fair value of the investment.\nQuarterly, we review our real property owned on a property by property basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest the property may be impaired. These indicators may include expected operational performance, the tenant's ability to make rent payments, a change in management's intent to hold and operate the property and changes in the market that may permanently reduce the value of the property. If indicators of impairment exist, an undiscounted cash flow analysis will be prepared to determine if the value of the property will be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows indicate that the carrying value of the property will not be recoverable, the carrying value of the property is reduced to its estimated fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. The analysis requires us to use judgment in determining whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate the expected future undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair values of the property. Properties that meet the held for sale criteria are recorded at the lesser of the fair value less costs to sell or carrying value.\nWe also evaluate investments in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment and, when present, record impairment charges based on a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value if the decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary. \nAt December 31, 2024, our net real property owned was approximately $40,673,242,000 and investments in unconsolidated entities totaled $1,768,772,000. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded impairment charges of \n$92,793,000 related to 18 Seniors Housing Operating properties, three\n Triple-net properties and \none\n Outpatient Medical property. No impairment losses related to investments in unconsolidated entities were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n75\nItem 7.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNature of Critical\nAccounting Estimate\nAssumptions/Approach\nUsed\nReal Estate Acquisitions\nMost of our real estate acquisitions are considered asset acquisitions for which we record the related real estate acquired (tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities) at cost on a relative fair value basis. Liabilities assumed and any associated noncontrolling interests are reflected at fair value. Tangible assets consist primarily of land, building and improvements. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities primarily consist of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. The total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with respect to that tenant. \nFor real estate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, we allocate the acquisition consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the consideration transferred relative to the fair value of the net assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill. \n \nIn determining the fair values that drive the recorded tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities,  we estimate the fair value of each component of the real estate acquired, which generally includes land, buildings and improvements, the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases using a number of sources including independent appraisals, our own analysis of recently acquired or developed and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. Significant assumptions used to determine such fair values include comparable land sales, capitalization rates, discount rates, market rental rates and property operating data, all of which can be impacted by expectations about future market or economic conditions. Our estimates of the values of these components affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property or the term of the lease and the amount of goodwill recognized in an acquisition accounted for as a business combination.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we disbursed $3,525,449,000 of cash related to real estate asset acquisitions and business combinations.\n76\nItem 7.\n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNature of Critical\nAccounting Estimate\nAssumptions/Approach\nUsed\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of joint venture entities in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. In addition, we consolidate those entities deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nWe make judgments about which entities are VIEs based on an assessment of whether (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. We make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors include, but is not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form of ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or on a continuous basis when determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. If we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the VIE, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans Receivable\nThe allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. The determination of the credit allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. \nWe evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable based on a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, payment status, historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors, and nature, extent and value of the underlying collateral. A loan is considered to have deteriorated credit quality when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. For those loans we identified as having deteriorated credit quality, we determine the amount of credit loss on an individual basis. Placement on non-accrual status may be required. Consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed to have deteriorated credit quality. To the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we may return these loans to income accrual status. While a loan is on non-accrual status, any cash receipts are applied against the outstanding principal balance. For the remaining loans, we assess credit loss on a collective pool basis and use our historical loss experience for similar loans to determine the reserve for credit losses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized provision for loan losses of $10,125,000, which includes changes in the reserve based on our historical loss experience.",
