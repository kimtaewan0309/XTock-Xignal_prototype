MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Item 1 thereto, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (\"2024 Annual Report\").\nBaker Hughes Company (\"Baker Hughes,\" \"the Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") is an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We conduct business in more than 120 countries and employ approximately 57,000 employees. We operate through our two business segments: Oilfield Services & Equipment (\"OFSE\") and Industrial & Energy Technology (\"IET\"). We sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream and downstream segments, as well as broader industrial and new energy markets.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nMarket Conditions\nIn the third quarter of 2025, we saw continued slowing of activity across global oil markets, primarily due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, uncertainty around international trade policy, and operator concerns about the accelerated return of idled supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (\"OPEC+\").\nAs we look to the fourth quarter of 2025 and into 2026, we remain positive on the global natural gas outlook, while we anticipate ongoing volatility in oil markets. We expect that softer demand combined with increased OPEC+ production will contribute to rising oil inventories, which may lead to continued fluctuations in oil prices through 2026. Our forecast for global upstream spending in 2025 remains unchanged, with spending anticipated to be lower than in 2024 and restrained until the market absorbs potential oversupply. Over the longer term, we maintain our expectation for producers to shift spending towards the optimization of producing fields.\nWe remain optimistic on the global natural gas outlook, supported by a continued shift toward natural gas development and liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\"). We believe the positive fundamentals for global natural gas are less affected by near-term macro uncertainty. This optimism is underpinned by strong demand growth, favorable LNG contracting trends, and continuing positive momentum from other structural growth drivers, including rising power consumption and an ongoing commitment to lowering emissions throughout the energy ecosystem.\nWe will continue to monitor market conditions and assess potential risks, including uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment, trade policy and tariffs, the pace of OPEC+ restarted idled oil production, oil price volatility, changes in regulations and tax or other incentives for new energy solutions.\nFinancial Results and Key Company Initiatives\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the Company generated revenues of $7.0 billion, an increase of $0.1 billion, or 1%, compared to the third quarter of 2024. IET revenue increased $0.4 billion, or 15%, driven by strong growth in Gas Technology Equipment (\"GTE\") and Gas Technology Services (\"GTS\"). OFSE revenue decreased $0.3 billion, or 8%, led by a decline in international revenue. Net income was $0.6 billion, a decrease of $0.2 billion, or 20%, compared to the third quarter of 2024, with a decline in the market-to-market adjustment of certain equity securities, decreased volume, lower cost productivity, and transaction costs, partially offset by structural cost out initiatives, price, and favorable FX. We continue to progress in our efforts to improve efficiencies and modernize how the business operates, and those benefits have resulted in improved profitability.\nAs a part of our anticipated acquisition of Chart Industries, Inc. (\"Chart\"), Chart shareholders approved the acquisition of Chart by the Company (the \"Chart acquisition\") on October 6, 2025. We are currently working with various regulatory agencies to achieve the customary approvals and continue to expect the Chart acquisition to close in mid-2026. On portfolio management actions, we closed the acquisition of Continental Disc Corporation (\"CDC\") on August 7, 2025. The sale of Precision Sensors & Instrumentation to Crane Company and the creation of the Surface Pressure Control joint venture with Cactus, Inc. are progressing as expected, with both transactions anticipated to close in early 2026.\nBaker Hughes Company 2025 Third Quarter Form 10-Q | 26\nIn the third quarter of 2025, we returned $227 million to shareholders through dividends.\nOutlook\nOur business is exposed to a number of macro factors, which influence our outlook and expectations given the current macroeconomic uncertainty and continued volatile conditions in the industry. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today and are subject to changing conditions in the industry.\n•\nOFSE outlook: We expect continued soft operator activity through the remainder of 2025, and global upstream spending will remain constrained until the potential excess oil supply is absorbed.\n•\nIET outlook: We see continued strength in LNG and gas infrastructure, as well as increasing opportunities to leverage our versatile portfolio to enhance IET's position across industrial and distributed power markets, with a growing emphasis on data centers.\nWe also expect to see continued growth in new energy solutions specifically focused around reducing carbon emissions for the energy and broader industrial sectors. These include hydrogen; geothermal; carbon capture, utilization and storage; energy storage; clean power; and emissions abatement solutions.\nOverall, we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver integrated, high-impact solutions for our customers. Over time, we believe global energy demand will continue to rise, supported by durable, secular macroeconomic trends, with hydrocarbons continuing to play a fundamental role in meeting the world's energy needs. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, lower-emission, and cost-effective solutions that drive meaningful improvements in operational and financial performance for our customers.\nSustainability\nWe believe we have an important role to play in society as an industry leader and partner. We view the area of sustainability as a lever to transform the performance of our Company. In 2019, we made a commitment to reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from our operations by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. We continue to make progress on emissions reductions and reported in our 2024 Corporate Sustainability Report a 29.3% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent emissions as compared to our 2019 base year.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity position as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, and should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nOur revenue is predominantly generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations, and their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.\nOil and Natural Gas Prices\nOutside North America, customer spending is influenced by Brent oil prices. In North America, customer spending is influenced by WTI oil prices and natural gas prices are measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price.\nBaker Hughes Company 2025 Third Quarter Form 10-Q | 27\nOil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nBrent oil prices ($/Bbl) \n(1)\n$\n69.03 \n$\n80.01 \n$\n71.00 \n$\n82.50 \nWTI oil prices ($/Bbl) \n(2)\n65.78 \n76.43 \n67.31 \n78.58 \nNatural gas prices ($/mmBtu) \n(3)\n3.03 \n2.11 \n3.45 \n2.11 \n(1)\nEnergy Information Administration (\"EIA\") Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel\n(2)\nEIA Cushing, OK West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") spot price\n(3)\nEIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit\nRig Count\nRig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active or operating they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Therefore, rig counts may act as a leading indicator of market activity and reflect the relative strength of energy prices; however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.\nRig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.\nThe rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated based on our published rig counts in our website at www.bakerhughes.com.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n% Change\nNorth America\n718 \n796 \n(10)\n%\n740 \n788 \n(6)\n%\nInternational\n1,080 \n1,151 \n(6)\n%\n1,085 \n1,172 \n(7)\n%\nWorldwide\n1,798 \n1,947 \n(8)\n%\n1,825 \n1,960 \n(7)\n%\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussions below relating to significant line items from our condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.\nOur condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) display sales and costs of sales in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") regulations under which \"goods\" is required to include all sales of tangible products and \"services\" must include all other sales, including other service activities. For the amounts shown below, we distinguish between \"equipment\" and \"product services,\" where product services refer to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs), which is an important part of our operations. We refer to \"product services\" simply as \"services\" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nBaker Hughes Company 2025 Third Quarter Form 10-Q | 28\nOur results of operations are evaluated by our chief operating decision maker, who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level. The performance of each segment is \nevaluated based on \nsegment Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"),\n which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and before the following: net interest expense, costs associated with significant restructuring programs, depreciation and amortization, and unallocated corporate costs and other income (expense).\nIn evaluating the performance, we primarily use the following:\nVolume:\n Volume is defined as the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. Volume also includes price, which is defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services.\nForeign Exchange (\"FX\"):\n \nFX measures the translational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the FX rate compared to the U.S. dollar. FX impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX rate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period.\n(Inflation)/Deflation:\n (Inflation)/deflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material, compensation and benefits, and overhead costs.\nProductivity: \nProductivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume and price, FX, and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the period-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes.\nOrders and Remaining Performance Obligations\nSummarized orders information for our segments are shown in the following table.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n$ Change\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n$ Change\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nOrders:\nOilfield Services & Equipment\n$\n4,068\n \n$\n3,807\n \n$\n261\n \n$\n10,852\n \n$\n11,500\n \n$\n(648)\nGas Technology Equipment\n2,174 \n1,088 \n1,086 \n4,290 \n3,810 \n480 \nGas Technology Services\n896 \n778 \n117 \n2,795 \n2,239 \n556 \nTotal Gas Technology\n3,070 \n1,866 \n1,203 \n7,085 \n6,049 \n1,036 \nIndustrial Products\n481 \n494 \n(13)\n1,494 \n1,564 \n(70)\nIndustrial Solutions\n336 \n293 \n43 \n944 \n831 \n113 \nTotal Industrial Technology\n817 \n787 \n30 \n2,438 \n2,395 \n43 \nClimate Technology Solutions \n(1)\n253 \n215 \n38 \n1,324 \n800 \n524 \nIndustrial & Energy Technology\n4,139\n \n2,868\n \n1,271\n \n10,847\n \n9,244\n \n1,603\n \nTotal\n$\n8,207\n \n$\n6,676\n \n$\n1,532\n \n$\n21,699\n \n$\n20,744\n \n$\n955\n \n(1)\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, total new energy orders incorporates Climate Technology Solutions (\"CTS\") in IET.\nThe Remaining Performance Obligations (\"RPO\") relate to the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations. As of September 30, 2025, RPO totaled $35.3 billion, of which OFSE totaled $3.2 billion, and IET totaled $32.1 billion.\nBaker Hughes Company 2025 Third Quarter Form 10-Q | 29\nThird\n Quarter of 2025 Compared to the \nThird\n Quarter of 2024\nRevenue increased $0.1 billion, or 1%, to $7.0 billion. OFSE decreased $0.3 billion, or 8%, and IET increased $0.4 billion, or 15%.\nSelling, general and administrative costs decreased $5 million, or 1%, to $607 million.\nResearch and development costs decreased $11 million, or 7%, to $146 million.\nWe recorded other expense of $71 million in the third quarter of 2025, which included $47 million of transaction costs related to business acquisition and disposal activities and a \nnet loss\n of $8 million from the change in fair value of equity securities. In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded $134 million of other income. Included in this amount was a net gain of $99 million from the change in fair value of equity securities.\nNet interest expense incurred in the third quarter of 2025 was $56 million, which includes interest income of $21 million. Net interest expense increased $1 million compared to the third quarter of 2024.\nWe recorded income taxes in the third quarter of 2025 and 2024 of $204 million and $235 million, respectively. The difference between the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% and the effective tax rate in both periods is primarily related to\n \nincome generated in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than in the U.S. and losses with no tax benefit due to valuation allowances. Further, for the period ending September 30, 2024, this impact is partially offset by income subject to U.S. tax at an effective rate less than 21% due to valuation allowances, which were subsequently released later in 2024.\nNet income decreased $0.2 billion, or 20%, to $0.6 billion compared to the third quarter of 2024.\nSegment Revenues and \nSegment EBITDA\nOilfield Services & Equipment\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n$ Change\n2025\n2024\nRevenue\nWell Construction\n$\n954 \n$\n1,050\n$\n(97)\nCompletions, Intervention, and Measurements\n945 \n1,009\n(63)\nProduction Solutions\n966 \n983\n(17)\nSubsea & Surface Pressure Systems\n771 \n921\n(150)\nTotal\n$\n3,636\n \n$\n3,963\n$\n(327)\nCost of goods and services sold\n$\n2,905 \n$\n3,112\n$\n(209)\nResearch and development costs\n60 \n67\n(6)\nSelling, general and administrative\n220 \n237\n(17)\nOther (income) expense\n1 \n—\n1 \nLess: Depreciation and amortization\n(221)\n(218)\n(3)\nSegment EBITDA\n$\n671\n \n$\n765\n$\n(94)\nOFSE revenue of \n$3,636 million decreased $327 million, or 8%, in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024, due to lower rig count.

We continue to maintain solid financial strength and sufficient liquidity. At September 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion compared to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2024.\nIn the U.S. we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.6 billion as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, and outside the U.S. of approximately $2.1 billion and $2.8 billion as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. A substantial portion of the cash held outside the U.S. at September 30, 2025 has been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate certain cash to the U.S., we may incur other additional taxes that would not be significant to the total tax provision.\nWe have a $3.0 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Agreement\") with commercial banks maturing in November 2028. The Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, certain affirmative covenants and negative covenants, in each case we consider customary. No related events of default have occurred. The Credit Agreement is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Baker Hughes. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nCertain Senior Notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions. See \"Note 8. Debt\" of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details. At September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. Our next debt maturity is December 2026.\nBaker Hughes Company 2025 Third Quarter Form 10-Q | 33\nWe continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to the uncertainty created by geopolitical events, a global pandemic, or a significant decline in oil and gas prices, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility; however, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.\nOn July 28, 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of Chart's common stock for $210 per share in cash, equivalent to a total enterprise value of $13.6 billion. Our expected sources of funds for the acquisition include cash and cash equivalents to be generated from cash flow from operations, expected asset sales proceeds, and new debt financing. As a result, we entered into a senior unsecured 364-day bridge facility (the \"Bridge Facility\") and a senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility (the \"DDTL\"). The final structure of the new debt financing will be determined prior to transaction close. The incurrence of new indebtedness would increase our leverage and debt service requirements, which could impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we dispersed cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs, capital expenditures, the payment of dividends, and repurchases of our common stock.\nCash Flows\nCash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the nine months ended September 30:\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\nOperating activities\n$\n2,148 \n$\n2,142 \nInvesting activities\n(1,651)\n(799)\nFinancing activities\n(1,224)\n(1,293)\nOperating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $2,148 million and $2,142 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOur largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to our sales of products and services, including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and others for a wide range of goods and services.\nCash from operating activities is primarily generated from net income or loss adjusted for certain noncash items (including depreciation, amortization, change in fair value of equity securities, stock-based compensation cost, and deferred tax benefit or provision).\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net working capital cash usage was $34 million, mainly due to progress collections and accounts payable payments partially offset by accounts receivable collections, contract assets, and inventory reduction.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net working capital cash usage was $57 million, mainly due to an increase in inventory and contract assets as we continued to build for growth, partially offset by accounts receivable.\nIncluded in the cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were payments of $129 million and $187 million, respectively, made primarily for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities.\nBaker Hughes Company 2025 Third Quarter Form 10-Q | 34\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities were $1,651 million and $799 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOur principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures including property, plant and equipment (\"PP&E\") and software, to support and generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets were $896 million and $925 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the disposal of PP&E of $139 million and $145 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets were primarily related to OFSE equipment that was lost-in-hole, and PP&E no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we completed the acquisition of CDC in the IET segment in an all-cash transaction for approximately $542 million.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we entered into an agreement to acquire Chart. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid $258 million for the termination fee and the reimbursement of certain expenses on behalf of Chart to Flowserve Corporation (\"Flowserve\"), as a result of the termination of the merger agreement by and among Chart and Flowserve.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows used in financing activities were $1,224 million and $1,293 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe increased our quarterly dividend during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 by two cents to $0.23 and one cent to $0.21 per share, respectively. We paid dividends of $683 million and $628 million to our Class A shareholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe repurchased and canceled 9.8 million shares of Class A common stock for a total of $384 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and canceled 15.0 million shares of Class A common stock for a total of $476 million.\nWe repaid long-term debt of $134 million primarily related to debentures that matured in June 2024 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nCash Requirements\nWe believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available revolving credit facility, access to our uncommitted lines of credit, the Bridge Facility, the DDTL, and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity in the short-term and long-term to manage our working capital needs; meet contractual obligations; fund strategic growth initiatives, capital expenditures, and dividends; repay debt; repurchase our common stock; and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies.\nOur capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. We continue to believe that based on current market conditions, capital expenditures in 2025 are expected to be made at a rate that would equal up to 5% of annual revenue. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business.\nBased on our current outlook, we anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $1.1 billion in 2025.\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity\nCustomer receivables\n:\n \nIn line with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets. While historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk by \nBaker Hughes Company 2025 Third Quarter Form 10-Q | 35\nworking with our customers to restructure their debts or utilizing available trade receivable facilities that enable us to manage collection risk. With regard to our primary customer in Mexico, there have not historically been any material losses due to uncollectible accounts receivable, nor are any such balances currently in dispute. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had credit default swaps (\"CDS\") totaling $775 million and $553 million, respectively, with third-party financial institutions. The CDS relate to borrowings provided by these financial institutions to our primary customer in Mexico who utilized these borrowings to pay certain of the Company's outstanding receivables. The total notional amount remaining on the issued CDS was $377 million and $412 million as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, which will reduce each month through September 2026 as the customer repays the borrowings. As of September 30, 2025, the fair value of these derivative liabilities is not material.\nA customer's failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results of operations. Our gross customer receivables were 16% in the U.S. as of September 30, 2025. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our gross customer receivables at this date.\nInternational operations\n:\n \nOur cash that is held outside the U.S. is 77% of the total cash balance as of September 30, 2025. Depending on the jurisdiction or country where this cash is held, we may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash.\nGuarantor Financial Information\nWe guarantee various senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured debentures (collectively, the \"Debt Securities\") outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of $5.8 billion as of September 30, 2025, with maturities ranging from 2026 to 2047. The Debt Securities constitute debt obligations of Baker Hughes Holdings LLC (\"BHH LLC\"), an indirect, 100% owned subsidiary and the primary operating company of Baker Hughes, and Baker Hughes Co-Obligor, Inc, a 100% owned finance subsidiary of BHH LLC (together with BHH LLC, the \"Issuers\") that was incorporated for the sole purpose of serving as a corporate co-obligor of debt securities. The Debt Securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's other senior and unsecured debt obligations. However, because these obligations are not secured, they would be effectively subordinated to any existing or future secured indebtedness of Baker Hughes and the Issuers.\nAs permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, we have excluded summarized financial information for the Issuers because the combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Issuers are not materially different than the corresponding amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur critical accounting estimation processes are consistent with those described in Item 7 of Part II, \"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\" of our 2024 Annual Report.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (each a \"forward-looking statement\").
