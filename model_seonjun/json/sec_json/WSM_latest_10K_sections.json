  "item1": "ITEM 1.    BUSINESS \nOVERVIEW \nWilliams-Sonoma, Inc., (the “Company”, “we”, or “us”) incorporated in 1973, is an omni-channel specialty retailer of high-quality products for the home. \nIn 1956, our founder, Chuck Williams, turned a passion for cooking and eating with friends into a small business with a big idea. He opened a store in Sonoma, California to sell the French cookware that intrigued him while visiting Europe but that could not be found in America. Chuck’s business, which set a standard for customer service, took off and helped fuel a revolution in American cooking and entertaining that continues today. \nIn the decades that followed, the quality of our products, our ability to identify new opportunities in the market and our people-first approach to business have facilitated our expansion beyond the kitchen into nearly every area of the home, as well as the places where our customers work, stay and play. Our in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organization allow us to deliver high-quality, sustainable products at competitive prices. Through our e-commerce platform, our in-house customer relationship management and data analytic teams optimize our digital spend and customer connections. We have expanded our in-store services to not only provide an exceptional customer service experience but to also serve as design centers and omni-fulfillment hubs.\nOur vision is to own the home, and the places where our customers work, stay and play. Our products in our portfolio of nine brands — Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm, Williams Sonoma Home, Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham, and GreenRow — are marketed through e-commerce websites, our retail stores and direct-mail catalogs. These brands are also part of The Key Rewards, our loyalty and credit card program that offers members exclusive benefits across the Williams-Sonoma family of brands. We operate in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, offer international shipping to customers worldwide and have unaffiliated franchisees that operate stores in the Middle East, the Philippines, Mexico, South Korea and India, as well as e-commerce websites in certain locations.\nWe are focused on three key priorities — returning to growth, elevating our world-class customer service and driving earnings. We believe our growth will be driven by our business strategies in each of our core businesses, our business-to-business division and our emerging brands. We will continue to improve our world-class customer service by driving supply chain improvements from reduced out-of-market and multiple shipments, fewer customer accommodations, lower returns and damages, and reduced replacements. Additionally, we see opportunity to drive margin by focusing on full-price selling and cost negotiations. We have a powerful portfolio of brands, serving a range of categories, aesthetics, and life stages and we have built a strong omni-channel platform and infrastructure, which will position us well for the next stage of growth.\nWilliams Sonoma \nFrom the beginning, our namesake brand, Williams Sonoma, has been bringing people together around food. A leading specialty retailer of high-quality products for the kitchen and home, the brand seeks to provide world-class service and an engaging customer experience. Williams Sonoma products offer everything for cooking, dining and entertaining, including: cookware, tools, electrics, cutlery, tabletop and bar, outdoor, furniture and a vast library of cookbooks. The brand also includes Williams Sonoma Home, a premium concept that offers classic home furnishings and decorative accessories, extending the Williams Sonoma lifestyle beyond the kitchen into every room of the home. \nPottery Barn \nEstablished in 1949 and acquired by Williams-Sonoma, Inc. in 1986, Pottery Barn is a premier omni-channel home furnishings retailer. America’s most meaningful, beautiful design source, Pottery Barn brings together good products, people and values — seeking inspiration, quality and world-class customer service in everything we do. Thoughtfully designed and crafted to last, Pottery Barn’s furniture, bedding, lighting, rugs, table essentials, decorative accessories and more can be loved for a lifetime.\n4\nTable of \nContents\nPottery Barn Kids \nSince 1999, Pottery Barn Kids’ mission has been to bring the utmost in quality, safety and style into every family’s home. Kids are, and have always been, the inspiration behind Pottery Barn Kids. Pottery Barn Kids’ designs are rigorously tested to meet the highest child safety standards and are expertly crafted from the best materials to last beyond their childhood years.\nWest Elm \nBorn in Brooklyn in 2002, West Elm is dedicated to transforming people’s spaces through creativity and style. West Elm creates unique, modern and affordable home décor and curates a selection of goods that are crafted by makers from across the world.  \nPottery Barn Teen \nLaunched in 2003, Pottery Barn Teen is the first home concept to focus exclusively on the teen market. Pottery Barn Teen’s purpose is to make safe and sustainable designs that inspire teens to create the world they want to live in. Pottery Barn Teen designs everything from organic bedding to multi-purpose furniture that adapts and lasts, with a mission to create for the future.\nRejuvenation \nRejuvenation, founded in 1977 with a passion for timeless design and quality craftsmanship, was acquired by Williams-Sonoma, Inc. in 2011. With design, manufacturing and distribution facilities in Portland, Oregon, Rejuvenation offers a wide assortment of made-to-order lighting, hardware, furniture and home décor inspired by history, designed for today and made to last for years to come. \nMark and Graham \nEstablished in 2012, Mark and Graham is a leading monogrammed lifestyle brand that offers thoughtfully designed personalized products and custom gifts. The digitally-native brand is known for high quality collections, ranging from home gifts to luggage to handbags, designed in-house that can be personalized with hundreds of monograms.\nGreenRow\nGreenRow, established in 2023, is an internally designed and developed brand specializing in the use of sustainable materials and manufacturing practices to create colorful, vintage-inspired heirloom quality products. Every product in the digitally-native brand's assortment prioritizes utilizing innovative, sustainable manufacturing practices with low-impact materials wherever possible — including responsibly sourced linen, cotton, wood and recycled materials.\nOutward\nIn 2017, we acquired Outward, Inc., a 3-D imaging and augmented reality platform for the home furnishings and décor industry. Headquartered in San Jose, California, Outward’s technology enables scalable applications in product visualization, digital room design and augmented and virtual reality.\nOPERATIONS \nAs of February 2, 2025, we had the following merchandise strategies: Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm, Williams Sonoma Home, Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham, and GreenRow, which sell our products through our e-commerce websites, retail stores and direct-mail catalogs. We offer shipping from many of our brands to countries worldwide, while our catalogs reach customers throughout the U.S. The e-commerce and retail businesses complement each other by meeting customers where they are; building brand awareness and acting as effective advertising vehicles. Our ability to leverage insights, our omni-channel positioning and our marketing efforts, focused on digital advertising complemented by targeted catalogs, drive sales to each of our channels. Consistent with our published privacy policies, we leverage our proprietary customer file, which is a unified view of customers across brands and channels, for digital, email and catalog marketing purposes, augmented by models developed by our in-house analytics team. Our retail stores serve as billboards for our brands, which we believe inspires new and existing customers to also shop online. We operate 512 stores, which include 477 stores in 40 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, 19 stores in Canada, 14 stores in Australia and 2 stores in the United Kingdom. We also have multi-year franchise agreements with third parties in the Middle East, the Philippines, Mexico, South Korea and India that currently operate 126 franchised locations as well as e-commerce websites in certain locations. \n5\nTable of \nContents\nSUPPLIERS \nWe purchase most of our merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 3% of our purchases during fiscal 2024. Approximately 18% of our products were produced in the U.S. in fiscal 2024. The remaining 82% of our merchandise purchases were sourced from foreign suppliers, with approximately 23% from China, 16% from India, 14% from Vietnam and 29% from the rest of the world. Merchandise purchases in fiscal 2024 from Mexico and Canada were not significant. Substantially all of these purchases were negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars.\nWe manufacture merchandise, primarily upholstered furniture and lighting, at our facilities located in North Carolina, Oregon and Mississippi. The current macroeconomic environment is uncertain, and we are subject to risks that may disrupt our supply chain operations or regionalization efforts, such as tariffs, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increasing labor costs and union organizing activity. Despite these challenges, we believe our key differentiators, growth strategies and the efficiencies of our operating model to reduce costs and manage inventory levels leave us well-positioned to mitigate these costs in both the short- and long-term.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity and capital resources for the 53 weeks ended February 2, 2025 (“fiscal 2024”), and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2024 (“fiscal 2023”) should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. Fiscal 2024 results included a 53rd week, which we estimate contributed 150 basis points to revenue growth and 20 basis points to operating margin in fiscal 2024. All explanations of changes in operational results are discussed in order of magnitude.\nA discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2023 compared to the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2023 (“fiscal 2022”), can be found under \nItem 7\n in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023, filed with the SEC on March 20, 2024, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and under the Financial Reports section of our Investor Relations website.\nOVERVIEW \nOur products in our portfolio of nine brands — Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm, Williams Sonoma Home, Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham, and GreenRow — are marketed through e-commerce websites, our retail stores and direct-mail catalogs. These brands are also part of The Key Rewards, our loyalty and credit card program that offers members exclusive benefits across the Williams-Sonoma family of brands. We operate in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, offer international shipping to customers worldwide, and have unaffiliated franchisees that operate stores in the Middle East, the Philippines, Mexico, South Korea and India, as well as e-commerce websites in certain locations.\nBeginning in fiscal 2021 and continuing through fiscal 2022, global supply chain disruptions caused delays in inventory receipts and backorder delays, increased raw material costs, and higher shipping-related charges. These disruptions improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. However, the costs from these operational supply chain challenges impacted our Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the first half of fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2024 Financial Results \nNet revenues in fiscal 2024, including the impact of the additional week, decreased $39.1 million, or 0.5%, with company comparable brand revenue (\"company comp\") decline of 1.6%. This decrease was driven by customer hesitancy towards furniture purchases, partially offset by strength in our non-furniture and seasonal assortments. From a channel perspective, the company comp decline of 1.6% was driven by a negative 2.5% comp in our e-commerce channel, partially offset by a positive 0.2% comp in our retail channel. In fiscal 2023, comparable brand revenue decline was materially consistent across both channels.\nIn fiscal 2024, Pottery Barn, our largest brand, saw comparable brand revenue (\"brand comp\") decline of 6.2%  driven by reduced furniture demand and our strategy to reduce promotional activity, partially offset by relative strength in our non-furniture and seasonal categories. The Pottery Barn Kids and Teen brands saw brand comp growth of 3.0% in fiscal 2024, driven by strength in collaborations, our dorm and baby offerings and seasonal decor. \nWest Elm saw brand comp decline of 2.0% in fiscal 2024 driven by the impacts of the customer pull back in furniture during the first half of the year as a result of the brand's high percentage of its assortment in the furniture category, partially offset by strength from new product introductions across categories including furniture, decorative accessories and seasonal textiles.\nThe Williams Sonoma brand saw brand comp growth of 2.4% in fiscal 2024 resulting from strength in the brand's kitchen business driven by cookware, cutlery and electrics as well as our seasonal and decorative offerings.\nFinally, our emerging brands, Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham, and GreenRow, combined, delivered double-digit brand comp growth.\nWe ended the year with a cash balance of $1.2 billion and generated positive operating cash flow of $1.4 billion. In addition to our cash balance, we also ended the year with no outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit. This strong liquidity position allowed us to fund the operations of our business, invest $221.6 million in capital expenditures and return $1.1 billion through stock repurchases and dividends to stockholders.\n35\nTable of \nContents\nIn fiscal 2024, diluted earnings per share was $8.79 (which included the benefit of an out-of-period freight adjustment in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 of $0.29) versus $7.28 (which included (i) an impact of $0.10 related to exit costs associated with the closure of our West Coast manufacturing facility and the exiting of Aperture, a division of our Outward subsidiary, and (ii) an impact of $0.05 related to reduction-in-force initiatives, primarily in our corporate functions) in fiscal 2023. \nWe continued to improve our world-class customer service by driving supply chain improvements from lower returns and damages, reduced out-of-market and multiple shipments, reduced replacements and fewer customer accommodations. These supply chain improvements continued to contribute meaningfully to our profitability in fiscal 2024. \nDespite a challenging environment for home furnishings, we delivered a record operating margin with double-digit diluted earnings per share growth. Our results this year demonstrate the flexibility, strength and durability of our operating model to drive market share gains and deliver profitability. Our performance was due to the strong execution of our teams as well as our continued focus on full-price selling and cost control from our Company-wide financial discipline.\nCommon Stock Split\nOn July 9, 2024, we effected a 2-for-1 stock split of our common stock through a stock dividend. All historical share and per share amounts, excluding treasury share amounts, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was reclassified from additional paid-in capital to common stock.\nOut-of-Period Freight Adjustment\nSubsequent to the filing of our fiscal 2023 Form 10-K, in April 2024, we determined that we over-recognized freight expense in fiscal 2021, 2022 and 2023 for a cumulative amount of $49.0 million. We evaluated the error, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and determined that no prior interim or annual periods were materially misstated. We then evaluated whether the cumulative amount of the over-accrual was material to our projected fiscal 2024 results, and determined the cumulative amount was not material. Therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2024 include an out-of-period adjustment of $49.0 million, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, to reduce cost of goods sold and accounts payable, which corrected the cumulative error on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 28, 2024.\nLooking Ahead to 2025 \nLooking ahead to 2025, our focus will remain on our three key priorities of (i) returning to growth, (ii) elevating our world-class customer service\n \nand (iii) driving earnings. Despite continued macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, we are focused on these priorities to deliver in 2025 and beyond.\nReturning to Growth\nFirst, we believe we will deliver organic, core-brand growth due to increased levels of newness, innovation and growth initiatives, such as Pottery Barn Teen's dorm offering, Pottery Barn Kids'\n \nModern Baby and West Elm Kids. We are able to differentiate ourselves competitively through our in-house design capabilities and vertically-integrated sourcing organization, with the ability to expand into white space opportunities within our largest brands. These differentiators give us a unique ability to offer high-quality products at compelling price points. \nSecond, we recognize the housing market may not improve in 2025. Therefore, a key component of our strategy is our robust non-furniture assortment that includes inspirational seasonal and decorative accessories, textiles and housewares. In addition, we will continue to introduce new furniture in compelling finishes and shapes.\nThird, we will continue investing in strategic outside partnerships and collaborations in our core brands. The talent of our in-house team with the creative vision of our collaborators attracts new customers and drives sales with our current customers.\nFourth, we will continue to find opportunities in our business-to-business division, leveraging our strength in design and commercial grade product offerings. Our multi-channel capabilities and our leading assortment of commercial grade products are competitive differentiators. Over the last few years, we have built customer relationships in the \n36\nTable of \nContents\ncommercial space in several industry verticals. In addition, our exclusive offering of design-to-delivery services is a competitive advantage as we continue to build our business-to-business project pipeline.  \nLastly, our emerging brands are expected to continue to provide incremental growth. We have the in-house competency and ability to incubate and build new brands. All of our brands were once an emerging brand, even our largest brand, Pottery Barn. A key component of our future growth comes from expansion in Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham, and GreenRow.\nElevating our World-Class Customer Service\nWe will continue our progress in delivering world-class customer service. We plan to continue to limit out-of-market and multiple shipments, reduce customer accommodations, lower returns and damages and reduce replacements. Additionally, we are focused on continued optimization and automation in our distribution centers and logistics networks to improve our service times.\nDriving Earnings\nThe supply chain improvements contributing to elevating our world-class customer service are expected to continue to contribute meaningfully to our profitability. Additionally, we will be disciplined on selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\"), including employment and advertising costs. Our pricing power, high e-commerce sales mix, retail optimization and highly efficient advertising are expected to drive earnings as we continue to control costs from our overall financial discipline.\nAs we look forward to the year ahead, we believe these key priorities will set us apart from our competition and allow us to drive long-term growth and profitability. We have a powerful portfolio of brands, serving a range of categories, aesthetics, and life stages, and we have built a strong omni-channel platform and infrastructure, which positions us well for the next stage of growth. However, the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with the weak housing market, elevated interest rates, layoffs, inflationary pressure, political uncertainty, global geopolitical instability and new tariffs could negatively impact our business. For information on risks, please see “Risk Factors” in \nPart I, Item 1A\n.\n37\nTable of \nContents\nResults of Operations \nNET REVENUES \nNet revenues consist of sales of merchandise to our customers through our e-commerce websites, retail stores and direct-mail catalogs, and include shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise to their homes. Our revenues also include sales to our business-to-business customers and to our franchisees, incentives received from credit card issuers in connection with our private label and co-branded credit cards, and breakage income related to our stored-value cards. \nNet revenues in fiscal 2024, including the impact of the additional week, decreased $39.1 million or 0.5%, with company comp decline of 1.6%. This decrease was driven by customer hesitancy towards furniture purchases, partially offset by strength in our non-furniture and seasonal assortments. From a channel perspective, the company comp decline of 1.6% was driven by a negative 2.5% comp in our e-commerce channel, partially offset by a positive 0.2% comp in our retail channel. In fiscal 2023, comparable brand revenue decline was materially consistent across both channels.\nThe following table summarizes our net revenues by brand for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023: \n(In thousands)\nFiscal 2024 \n1\nFiscal 2023 \n1\nPottery Barn\n$\n3,039,939 \n$\n3,206,167 \nWest Elm\n1,840,582 \n1,854,811 \nWilliams Sonoma\n1,302,821 \n1,260,045 \nPottery Barn Kids and Teen\n1,107,057 \n1,060,470 \nOther \n2\n421,142 \n369,159 \nTotal\n$\n7,711,541 \n$\n7,750,652 \n1\nIncludes business-to-business net revenues within each brand.\n2\nPrimarily consists of net revenues from Rejuvenation, our international franchise operations, Mark and Graham, and GreenRow.\nComparable Brand Revenue\nComparable brand revenue includes comparable e-commerce sales, including through our direct-mail catalog, and store sales, as well as shipping fees, sales returns and other discounts associated with current period sales. Comparable stores are defined as permanent stores where gross square footage did not change by more than 20% in the previous 12 months, and which have been open for at least 12 consecutive months without closure for more than seven days within the same fiscal month. Outlet comparable store revenues are included in their respective brands. Business-to-business revenues are included in comparable brand revenue for each of our brands. Sales to our international franchisees are excluded from comparable brand revenue as their stores and e-commerce websites are not operated by us. Sales from certain operations are also excluded until such time that we believe those sales are meaningful to evaluating their performance. Additionally, comparable brand revenue for new and emerging concepts is not separately disclosed until such time that we believe those sales are meaningful to evaluating the performance of the brand.\nComparable brand revenue growth (decline)\nFiscal 2024 \n1\nFiscal 2023 \n1\nPottery Barn\n(6.2)\n%\n(9.7)\n%\nWest Elm\n(2.0)\n(18.8)\nWilliams Sonoma\n2.4 \n(0.7)\nPottery Barn Kids and Teen\n3.0 \n(5.5)\nTotal \n2\n(1.6)\n%\n(9.9)\n%\n1\nComparable brand revenue is calculated on a 53-week to 53-week basis for fiscal 2024 and on a 52-week to 52-week basis for fiscal 2023, and includes business-to-business revenues within each brand.\n2\nTotal comparable brand revenue growth includes the results of Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham, and GreenRow.\n38\nTable of \nContents\nRETAIL STORE DATA \nFiscal 2024\nFiscal 2023\nStore count – beginning of year\n518\n530\nStore openings\n16\n13\nStore closings\n(22)\n(25)\nStore count – end of year\n512\n518\nStore selling square footage at year-end\n3,794,000\n3,805,000\nStore leased square footage (“LSF”) at year-end\n5,833,000\n5,890,000\nFiscal 2024\nFiscal 2023\nStore \nCount\nAvg. LSF \nPer Store\nStore \nCount\nAvg. LSF \nPer Store\nPottery Barn\n181\n15,100\n184\n15,000\nWilliams Sonoma\n154\n6,900\n156\n6,900\nWest Elm\n121\n13,300\n121\n13,200\nPottery Barn Kids\n45\n7,800\n46\n7,800\nRejuvenation\n11\n8,100\n11\n8,100\nTotal\n512\n11,400\n518\n11,400\nGROSS PROFIT \nGross profit is equal to our net revenues less costs of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes (i) cost of goods, which consists of cost of merchandise, inbound freight expenses, freight-to-store expenses and other inventory related costs such as replacements, damages, obsolescence and shrinkage; (ii) occupancy expenses, which consists of rent, other occupancy costs (including property taxes, common area maintenance and utilities) and depreciation; and (iii) shipping costs, which consists of third-party delivery services and shipping materials.\nOur classification of expenses in gross profit may not be comparable to other public companies, as we do not include non-occupancy-related costs associated with our distribution network in cost of goods sold. These costs, which include distribution network employment, third-party warehouse management and other distribution-related administrative expenses, are recorded in SG&A.\n(In thousands)\nFiscal 2024\n% Net \nRevenues\nFiscal 2023\n% Net \nRevenues\nGross profit \n1\n$\n3,582,299 \n46.5 \n%\n$\n3,303,601 \n42.6 \n%\n1\nIncludes occupancy expenses of $793.1 million and $814.3 million in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.\nFiscal 2024 vs. Fiscal 2023\nGross profit increased $278.7 million, or 8.4%, compared to fiscal 2023. Gross margin increased to 46.5% from 42.6% in fiscal 2023. This increase in gross margin of 390 basis points was driven by (i) higher merchandise margins of 170 basis points, (ii) supply chain efficiencies of 130 basis points, including reductions in returns and damages, reduced out-of-market and multiple shipments, reduced replacements, as well as fewer customer accommodations, (iii) an out-of-period freight adjustment of 70 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and (iv) the leverage of occupancy costs of 20 basis points.\n39\nTable of \nContents\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES \nSG&A consists of non-occupancy-related costs associated with our retail stores and e-commerce websites, distribution and manufacturing facilities, customer care centers, supply chain operations (buying, receiving and inspection) and corporate administrative functions.

SG&A as a percentage of net revenues increased to 27.9% from 26.6% for fiscal 2023. This increase of 130 basis points was primarily driven by (i) an increase in employment expense of 80 basis points due to higher performance-based incentive compensation and employee benefits costs and (ii) an increase in advertising expenses of 90 basis points; partially offset by (iii) lower general expenses of 40 basis points from the resolution of an indirect tax matter and a favorable insurance settlement.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe effective income tax rate was 24.3% for fiscal 2024, compared to 25.4% for fiscal 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by (i) higher excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation and (ii) the tax effect of earnings mix change, partially offset by (iii) fewer expirations of statutes of limitations related to uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2024.\nSince the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\"Framework\") in 2021, a number of countries have begun to enact legislation to implement the OECD international tax framework, including the Pillar Two minimum tax regime. To mitigate the administrative burden for Multinational Enterprises in complying with the OECD Global Anti-Base Erosion rules during the initial years of implementation, the OECD developed the temporary “Transitional Country-by-Country Safe Harbor” (\"Safe Harbor\"). This transitional Safe Harbor applies for fiscal years beginning on or before December 31, 2026, but not including a fiscal year that ends after June 30, 2028. Under the Safe Harbor, the top-up tax for such jurisdiction is deemed to be zero, provided that at least one of the Safe Harbor tests is met for the jurisdiction.\nOf the regions in which we operate, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Netherlands, Italy, Portugal and Vietnam have implemented Pillar Two frameworks effective January 1, 2024. Our subsidiaries were not subject to Pillar Two minimum tax in fiscal 2024 under the Safe Harbor rules.\nPillar Two minimum tax will be treated as a period cost in future periods when it is applicable. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two Framework, and monitoring legislative developments by other countries, especially in the regions in which we operate.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties in the future. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 2, 2025, while others are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our material cash requirements as of February 2, 2025 include the following contractual obligations and commitments arising in the normal course of business:\n•\nOur operating leases had fixed lease payment obligations, including imputed interest, of $1.6 billion, with $308.7 million payable within 12 months. See \nNote E\n to our Consolidated Financial Statements for amount outstanding as of February 2, 2025 related to operating leases.\n•\nOur purchase obligations consist primarily of open purchase orders to purchase inventory as well as commitments for products and services used in the normal course of business. As of February 2, 2025, our \n40\nTable of \nContents\npurchase obligations were approximately $996.7 million, with $979.5 million expected to be settled within 12 months.\nIn addition, we had $32.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 2, 2025, for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment. See \nNote D\n to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to income taxes.\nWe are party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to commercial matters, operating leases, trademarks, intellectual property and financial matters. Under these contracts, we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. \nSee \nNote I\n to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our commitments and contingencies.\nDividends\nIn fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, total cash dividends declared were approximately $293.2 million, or $2.28 per common share, and $236.8 million, or $1.80 per common share, respectively. In March 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a 16% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, from $0.57 to $0.66 per common share, subject to capital availability. Our quarterly cash dividend may be limited or terminated at any time. See “\nRisk Factor - If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends or repurchase our stock at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.\n”\nStock Repurchase Programs\nSee section titled “Stock Repurchase Programs” within \nPart II, Item 5\n of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nLiquidity Outlook\nWe believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and our available credit facilities will provide adequate liquidity for our business operations as well as dividends, capital expenditures, stock repurchases and other liquidity requirements associated with our business operations over the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any other trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that would impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months.\nSources of Liquidity\nAs of February 2, 2025, we held $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which was held in money market funds and interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, and of which $141.1 million was held by our international subsidiaries. As is consistent within our industry, our cash balances are seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter historically representing a significantly higher level of cash than other periods.\nThroughout the fiscal year, we utilize our cash resources to build our inventory levels in preparation for our peak selling season. Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise throughout the year. In fiscal 2025, we plan to use our cash resources to fund inventory purchases and inventory-related costs, employment-related costs, advertising and marketing initiatives, rental payments on our leases, stock repurchases and dividend payments, the payment of income taxes and property and equipment purchases.\nIn addition to our cash balances on hand, we have a credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\") which provides for a $500 million unsecured revolving line of credit. Our Credit Facility may be used to borrow revolving loans or to request the issuance of letters of credit. We may, upon notice to the administrative agent, request existing or new lenders, at such lenders’ option, to increase the Credit Facility by up to $250 million to provide for a total of $750 million of unsecured revolving credit.\n41\nTable of \nContents\nDuring fiscal 2024, we had no borrowings under our Credit Facility. Additionally, as of February 2, 2025, issued but undrawn standby letters of credit of $11.9 million were outstanding under our Credit Facility. The standby letters of credit were primarily issued to secure the liabilities associated with workers’ compensation and other insurance programs. \nOur Credit Facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, a financial covenant requiring a maximum leverage ratio (funded debt adjusted for operating lease liabilities to earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization and rent expense), and covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, merge or consolidate, and dispose of assets. As of February 2, 2025, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under our Credit Facility and, based on our current projections, we expect to remain in compliance throughout the next 12 months.\nLetter of Credit Facilities \nWe have three unsecured letter of credit facilities for a total of $35 million. Our letter of credit facilities contain covenants that are consistent with our Credit Facility. Interest on unreimbursed amounts under our letter of credit facilities accrues at a base rate as defined in the Credit Facility, plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio. As of February 2, 2025, the aggregate amount outstanding under our letter of credit facilities was $0.6 million, which represents only a future commitment to fund inventory purchases to which we had not taken legal title. On August 16, 2024, we renewed two of our letter of credit facilities on substantially similar terms. Two of the letter of credit facilities totaling $30 million mature on August 18, 2025, and the latest expiration date possible for future letters of credit issued under these facilities is January 15, 2026. One of the letter of credit facilities totaling $5 million matures on September 30, 2026, which is also the latest expiration date possible for future letters of credit issued under the facility.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities \nFor fiscal 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2023, and was primarily attributable to net earnings adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by higher spending on merchandise inventories as a result of timing of receipts. Net cash provided by operating activities compared to fiscal 2023 decreased primarily due to (i) higher spending on merchandise inventories, (ii) a decrease in accounts payable (as a result of supplier payment timing) and (iii) a decrease in gift card and other deferred revenue, partially offset by (iv) an increase in net earnings adjusted for non-cash items.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities \nFor fiscal 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $221.2 million compared to $188.3 million in fiscal 2023 and was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment related to technology, store construction and supply chain enhancements.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities \nFor fiscal 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $1.2 billion compared to $0.6 billion in fiscal 2023 and was primarily attributable to the repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2024 increased compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to an increase in repurchases of our common stock.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION \nWhile it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we have experienced varying levels of inflation, resulting in part from various supply chain disruptions, increased shipping and transportation costs, increased product costs, increased labor costs in the supply chain and other disruptions caused by the uncertain economic environment. Global trends, including inflationary pressures, are weakening consumer sentiment, negatively impacting consumer spending behavior and slowing down consumer demand for our products. However, our unique operating model and pricing power helped mitigate these increased costs during fiscal 2024. We cannot be assured that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future. For information on risks, please see “Risk Factors” in \nPart I, Item 1A\n.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, \n42\nTable of \nContents\nrevenues and expenses as well as the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nMerchandise Inventories\nThe significant estimates used in our inventory valuation are obsolescence (including excess and slow-moving inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value reserves) and estimates of inventory shrinkage. We reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends of inventory sold below cost and specific identification.\nThe reserves for shrinkage are recorded throughout the year based on historical shrinkage results, cycle count results within our distribution centers, expectations of future shrinkage and current inventory levels, and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Actual shrinkage is recorded at year-end based on the results of our cycle counts and year-end physical inventory counts, and can vary from our estimates recorded throughout the year due to such factors as changes in operations, the mix of our inventory (which ranges from large furniture to small tabletop items), transaction processing errors, changes in our technology systems, and execution against loss prevention initiatives in our stores, distribution facilities and off-site storage locations, and with our third-party warehouse and transportation providers. Accordingly, there is no material shrinkage reserve at year-end. Historically, actual shrinkage has not differed materially from our estimates.\nOur obsolescence and shrinkage reserve calculations contain estimates that require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors, including market conditions, the selling environment, historical results and current inventory trends. We have made no material changes to our assumptions included in the calculations of the obsolescence and shrinkage reserves throughout the year. In addition, we do not believe a 10% change in our inventory reserves would have a material effect on our net earnings. As of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, our inventory obsolescence reserves were $19.6 million and $23.6 million, respectively.\nLong-lived Assets\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nWe review the carrying value of all long-lived assets for impairment, primarily at an individual store level, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Our impairment analyses determine whether projected cash flows from operations are sufficient to recover the carrying value of these assets. The asset group is comprised of both property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets. Impairment may result when the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over its remaining useful life. Our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon our experience, the historical operations and estimates of future profitability and economic conditions. The estimates of future profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth, gross margin, employment costs, lease escalations, inflation and the overall economics of the retail industry, and are therefore subject to variability and difficult to predict. For operating lease right-of-use assets, we determine the fair value of the assets by using estimated market rental rates. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future results, real estate supply and demand, closure plans and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the excess of the asset or asset group’s net carrying value over its estimated fair value. During fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we recognized impairment charges, as a component of SG&A, of $3.9 million, $14.5 million and $15.6 million, respectively.\nIncome Taxes \nWe record reserves for our estimates of the additional income tax liability that is more likely than not to result from the ultimate resolution of foreign and domestic tax examinations. The results of these examinations and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. We review and update the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities, upon completion of tax examinations, upon expiration of statutes of limitation, or upon occurrence of other events. As of February 2, 2025, we had $32.4 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $26.3 million would, if recognized, affect the effective tax rate. Additionally, we accrue interest and penalties related to these unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. As of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, our accruals for the payment of interest and penalties totaled $6.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively. Due to the potential resolution \n43\nTable of \nContents\nof tax issues, it is reasonably possible that the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next twelve months by a range of $0 to $3.4 million.\nIn order to compute income tax on an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and adjust these estimates throughout the year as necessary. Adjustments to our income tax provision due to changes in our estimated effective tax rate are recorded in the interim period in which the change occurs. The tax expense (or benefit) related to items other than ordinary income is individually computed and recognized when the items occur. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of our earnings in various taxing jurisdictions or changes in tax law. Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 were 24.3% and 25.4%, respectively.\n44\nTable of \nContents",
