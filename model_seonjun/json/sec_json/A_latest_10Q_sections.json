MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (UNAUDITED)\n \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements regarding growth opportunities, including for and in our end markets, new product and service introductions, the position and strength of our businesses, products and services, market demand for and adoption of our products and solutions, the ability of our products and solutions to address customer needs and meet industry requirements, our focus on enhancing our customers’ experience, delivering differentiated product solutions and driving productivity improvements, leveraging our product platforms to maximize growth, our investments, including in manufacturing infrastructure, research and development and expanding and improving our applications and solutions portfolios, expanding our position in developing countries and emerging markets, our contributions to our defined benefit plans, our hedging programs and other actions to offset the effects of foreign currency and interest rate movements, our future effective tax rate, unrecognized tax benefits, reimbursement incentives, our ability to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including through cash generated from operations, the potential impact of adopting new accounting pronouncements, indemnification obligations, our sales, our purchase commitments, our capital expenditures, the integration, effects and timing of our acquisitions and other transactions, expense reduction and other results from our restructuring programs and other cost saving initiatives, our stock repurchase program and dividends, macroeconomic and market conditions, including relating to or arising from changes to tariffs, import/export or trade policies, the recovery and health of our end markets, seasonality, mix, future financial results, our operating margin, our geographical diversification, interest rates, inflationary pressures and local regulations and restrictions, that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Part II Item 1A and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.\nBasis of Presentation\n \nThe financial information presented in this Form 10-Q is not audited and is not necessarily indicative of our future consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss) or cash flows. Our fiscal year-end is October 31, and our fiscal quarters end on January 31, April 30 and July 31. Unless otherwise stated, these dates refer to our fiscal year and fiscal periods.\n \n Executive Summary\n \nAgilent Technologies, Inc. (\"we,\" \"Agilent\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.\n \nNew Segment Structure\n. \nIn November 2024, we announced a change in our organizational structure to support our market-focused, customer-centric strategy. Our former Diagnostics and Genomics segment combined with our liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry instrument platforms to form our new Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets segment. Our chemistries and supplies, laboratory automation, and software and informatics divisions moved from our former Life Sciences and Applied Markets segment to our Agilent CrossLab segment. The remaining divisions in our former Life Sciences and Applied Markets segment which includes our gas chromatography, gas chromatography mass spectrometry, remarketed instruments, spectroscopy and vacuum divisions form our new Applied Markets segment. \nWe began reporting under this new structure with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31, 2025. All historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation in our financial statements and accompanying notes.\nGlobal Tariffs\n. Recent changes to tariffs and trade policies by the U.S. and other countries have increased risk and uncertainty surrounding our future results of operations. In the first half of fiscal year 2025, changes to tariffs and trade policies did not have a material impact on our results of operations. In the second half of fiscal year 2025, the U.S. government introduced additional measures related to tariffs, including certain increases, exemptions and pauses, and other countries have responded with preliminary agreements and retaliatory actions. The ultimate impact of changes to tariffs and trade policies will depend on various factors, including the timing, amount, scope, and nature of any tariffs or trade policies implemented and our ability to respond to mitigate the impact of such tariffs and trade policies. We continue to monitor these evolving trade dynamics closely, as they may influence future revenue and operational efficiency.\n35\nTable of \nContents\nActual Results\n \nNet revenue of $1,738 million and $5,087 million for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 increased 10 percent and 6 percent, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. The overall effect of foreign currency movements on revenue growth for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 had a 2 percentage point favorable impact and no impact, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025, revenue growth came from all of our segments, all geographic regions we serve and most of our key end markets when compared to the same periods last year. Revenue from our BIOVECTRA acquisition contributed approximately 2 percentage points in both the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025. Revenue generated by our Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets segment for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 increased 14 percent and 9 percent, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year.\n \nThe overall effect of foreign currency movements on revenue growth for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 had a 2 percentage point favorable impact and no impact, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. Revenue generated by our Agilent CrossLab segment for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 increased 8 percent and 5 percent, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. The overall effect of foreign currency movements on revenue growth for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 had a 3 percentage point favorable impact and 1 percentage point unfavorable impact, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. Revenue generated by our Applied Markets segment for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 increased 7 percent and was flat, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. The overall effect of foreign currency movements on revenue growth for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025, had a 2 percentage point favorable impact and no impact, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. \nNet income for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 was $336 million and $869 million, respectively, compared to net income of $282 million and $938 million for the corresponding periods last year. In the nine months ended July 31, 2025, cash provided by operations was $1,014 million compared to cash provided by operations of $1,270 million in the same period last year.\nDividends.\n During the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025, we paid cash dividends of $0.248 per common share or $71 million and $0.744 per common share or  $212 million, respectively, on the company's common stock. During the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024, we paid cash dividends of $0.236 per common share or $68 million and $0.708 per common share or $206 million, respectively, on the company's common stock. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors. \n2023 Repurchase Program\n. On January 9, 2023, we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program (the \"2023 repurchase program\") designed, among other things, to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs. The 2023 repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $2.0 billion, excluding excise taxes, of our common stock at the company's discretion and has no fixed termination date. The 2023 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended, amended or discontinued at any time. The 2023 repurchase program commenced on March 1, 2023. During the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024, we repurchased and retired 4.397 million shares for $585 million, excluding excise taxes of $5.4 million and 5.991 million shares for $815 million, excluding excise taxes of $6.4 million, respectively,  under this authorization. During the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025, we repurchased and retired 737,474 shares for $85 million, excluding excise taxes of approximately $0.4 million and 2.734 million shares for $340 million, excluding excise taxes of approximately $2 million, respectively, under this authorization. As of July 31, 2025, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to approximately $34 million of our common stock under the 2023 repurchase program.\nLooking Forward.\n Our primary focus remains on enhancing our customers’ experience, delivering differentiated product solutions and driving productivity improvements. While customer capital budgets, including those of customers receiving funding from the U.S. federal government, continue to be constrained, we are seeing signs of a steady recovery. We also remain optimistic about the long-term health of our key end markets. While the recent tariff changes adversely impacted our costs of revenue in the third quarter, we expect to substantially mitigate the impact during our fiscal year 2026. With inflationary and tariff-related pressures remaining fluid, we are actively pursuing mitigation strategies through supply chain optimization, targeted pricing actions, and other cost-efficiency initiatives to protect margins and sustain long-term growth.\n36\nTable of \nContents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the U.S. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the U.S. requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements.\nAdoption of New Pronouncements\n \nSee Note 2, \"New Accounting Pronouncements,\" to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.\n \nRestructuring and Other Related costs\nSummary of Restructuring Plans.\n In fiscal year 2025, we announced a restructuring plan designed to optimize our management structure to better serve our customers. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we announced restructuring plans that were designed to reduce costs and expenses in response to macroeconomic conditions. These actions impact all three of our business segments. The costs associated with these restructuring plans were not allocated to our business segments' results; however, each business segment will benefit from the future cost savings from these actions. When completed, the restructuring programs are expected to result in the reduction in annual cost of sales and operating expenses over the three business segments. \n37\nTable of \nContents\nA summary of our aggregate liability relating to the restructuring plans and the total restructuring expense since inception of those plans are shown in the table below:\nWorkforce Reduction \nTotal\n(in millions)\nBalance at October 31, 2024\n$\n13 \nIncome statement expense\n1 \nCash payments\n(9)\nBalance at January 31, 2025\n$\n5 \nIncome statement expense\n56 \nNon-cash settlement (accelerated share-based compensation expense)\n(5)\nCash payments\n(5)\nCurrency translation impact\n1 \nBalance at April 30, 2025\n$\n52 \nIncome statement expense\n17 \nNon-cash settlement (accelerated share-based compensation expense)\n(11)\nCash payments\n(35)\nCurrency translation impact\n— \nBalance at July 31, 2025\n$\n23 \nRestructuring expense since inception of all plans:\nFiscal Year 2025 Plan\n73 \nFiscal Year 2024 Plan \n73 \nFiscal Year 2023 Plan\n50 \nTotal restructuring expense since inception of all plans\n$\n196 \nThe aggregate restructuring liability of $23 million at July 31, 2025, is recorded in other accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and reflects estimated future cash outlays.\nA summary of the charges in the condensed consolidated statement of operations resulting from the restructuring plans is shown below:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended \nJuly 31,\nJuly 31,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n(in millions)\nCost of products and services\n$\n7 \n$\n12 \n$\n22 \n$\n12 \nResearch and development\n— \n18 \n3 \n20 \nSelling, general and administrative\n10 \n37 \n49 \n39 \nTotal restructuring expense\n$\n17 \n$\n67 \n$\n74 \n$\n71 \nFiscal Year 2025 Plan (\"FY25 Plan\")\n. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we announced a restructuring plan designed to optimize our management structure to better serve our customers. The expense associated with this workforce reduction includes severance and other personnel-related costs. We expect to substantially complete these restructuring activities by the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. When completed, the restructuring program is estimated to result in the reduction of approximately $75 million to $80 million in annual cost of sales and operating expenses over our three business segments.\nIn connection with the FY25 Plan, we have recorded approximately $17 million and $73 million in restructuring and other related costs in the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025, respectively.\n38\nTable of \nContents\nA summary of the FY25 Plan activity is shown in the table below:\nWorkforce Reduction\n(in millions)\nBalance at January 31, 2025\n$\n— \nIncome statement expense\n56 \nNon-cash settlement (accelerated share-based compensation expense)\n(5)\nCash payments\n(1)\nCurrency translation impact\n1 \nBalance at April 30, 2025\n51 \nIncome statement expense\n17 \nNon-cash settlement (accelerated share-based compensation expense)\n(11)\nCash payments\n(34)\nCurrency translation impact\n— \nBalance at July 31, 2025\n$\n23 \nTotal restructuring expense since inception of FY25 Plan\n$\n73 \nFiscal Year 2024 Plan (\"FY24 Plan\")\n. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we announced a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and expenses in response to macroeconomic conditions. The expense associated with this workforce reduction includes severance and other personnel-related costs. As of July 31, 2025, we have completed all workforce management actions and payments in connection with the FY24 Plan. The restructuring program is expected to result in the reduction of approximately $100 million in annual cost of sales and operating expenses over our three business segments.\nIn connection with the FY24 Plan, we have recorded approximately $1 million in restructuring and other related costs due to changes in estimates in the nine months ended July 31, 2025.\nA summary of the FY24 Plan activity is shown in the table below:\nWorkforce \nReduction\n(in millions)\nBalance at October 31, 2024\n$\n11 \nIncome statement expense\n1 \nCash payments\n(8)\nBalance at January 31, 2025\n$\n4 \nCash payments\n(3)\nBalance at April 30, 2025\n$\n1 \nCash payments\n(1)\nBalance at July 31, 2025\n$\n— \nTotal restructuring expense since inception of FY24 Plan\n$\n73 \nFiscal Year 2023 Plan (\"FY23 Plan\")\n. We have completed all workforce management actions and payments in connection with the FY23 Plan.  During the nine months ended July 31, 2025, we settled cash payments of $2 million. \nForeign Currency\n \nOur revenue, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities and equity are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. The overall effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates had no impact on revenue growth for the nine months ended July 31, 2025 when compared to the same period last year. Typically, when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a positive impact on revenue, they will also have a negative impact by increasing our costs and expenses or vice versa. We calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each \n39\nTable of \nContents\nquarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We hedge revenue, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the condensed consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve-month period). We may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a long-term basis. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction.\n \nResults from Operations\nNet Revenue\n  \n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended \nYear over Year Change\n \nJuly 31,\nJuly 31,\nThree\nNine\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nMonths\nMonths\n(in millions)\nNet revenue:\nProducts\n$\n1,230 \n$\n1,121 \n$\n3,616 \n$\n3,455 \n10%\n5%\nServices and other\n508 \n457 \n1,471 \n1,354 \n11%\n9%\nTotal net revenue\n$\n1,738 \n$\n1,578 \n$\n5,087 \n$\n4,809 \n10%\n6%\n \nNet revenue for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 increased 10 percent and 6 percent, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year.

Product revenue growth in the nine months ended July 31, 2025, was primarily driven by increases in  our CDMO, liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, and consumables businesses partially offset by decreases in our cell analysis and vacuum businesses when compared to the same period last year.\nServices and other revenue for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 increased 11 percent and 9 percent, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. Services and other revenue consist of contract repair, preventative maintenance, compliance services, relocation services, installation services and consulting services related to the companion diagnostics and nucleic acid solutions businesses. For the three months ended July 31, 2025, service revenue increases reflected strong growth from contract repair and preventative maintenance services and strong growth in per incident services including on demand repair and compliance services. For the nine months ended July 31, 2025, service revenue increases reflected strong growth from contract repair and preventative maintenance services and was flat in per incident services including relocation and education and compliance services.\n40\nTable of \nContents\nNet Revenue By Segment\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended \nYear over Year Change\nJuly 31,\nJuly 31,\nThree\nNine\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nMonths\nMonths\n(in millions)\nNet revenue by segment:\nLife Sciences and Diagnostics Markets\n$\n670 \n$\n585 \n$\n1,971 \n$\n1,809 \n14%\n9%\nAgilent CrossLab\n744 \n691 \n2,153 \n2,041 \n8%\n5%\nApplied Markets\n324 \n302 \n963 \n959 \n7%\n—\nTotal net revenue\n$\n1,738 \n$\n1,578 \n$\n5,087 \n$\n4,809 \n10%\n6%\nRevenue in the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets segment for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025, increased 14 percent and 9 percent, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year.

In other major jurisdictions where we conduct business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2014.  \nWith these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that some tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months. However, management is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments or change in unrecognized tax benefits, if any.\nThe United States enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBBA\") on July 4, 2025, which permanently extends many of the expiring provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") and modifies several international provisions, which are generally applicable to Agilent in fiscal year 2027. The OBBBA is not expected to have any material impact on our effective tax rate or cash flow in the current fiscal year. We are assessing the potential impacts the OBBBA may have on fiscal year 2026 and beyond.\nSegment Overview\nIn November 2024, we announced a change in our organizational structure to support our market-focused, customer-centric strategy.
