Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding: projections of revenues, expenses, earnings, margins, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, pension and benefit obligations and funding requirements, and our liquidity position; cost reductions, restructuring activities, new product and service developments, competitive strengths or market position, acquisitions or divestitures; growth, declines and other trends in markets we sell into; new or modified laws, regulations and accounting pronouncements; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; general economic and capital markets conditions; the timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; and any other statements that address events or developments that Thermo Fisher intends or believes will or may occur in the future. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements are accompanied by such words. While the company may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the company’s estimates change, and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this report.\nA number of important factors could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company’s \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\n for the year ended December 31, 2024 (which is on file with the SEC). Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties relating to: the need to develop new products and adapt to significant technological change; implementation of strategies for improving growth; general economic conditions and related uncertainties; dependence on customers’ capital spending policies and government funding policies; the effect of economic and political conditions, impact of tariffs, and exchange rate fluctuations on international operations; use and protection of intellectual property; the effect of changes in governmental regulations; any natural disaster, public health crisis, pandemic, or other catastrophic event; and the effect of laws and regulations governing government contracts, as well as the possibility that expected benefits related to recent or pending acquisitions may not materialize as expected. \nThe company refers to various amounts or measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP measures). These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to their most directly comparable amount or measure under the section “\nNon-GAAP Measures\n” later in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nCertain amounts and percentages reported within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are presented and calculated based on underlying unrounded amounts. As a result, the sum of components may not equal corresponding totals due to rounding.\nOverview\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies.

Revenues in the academic and government market declined, reflecting customer hesitancy in a more uncertain environment, which resulted in muted demand for equipment and instruments. Revenues grew in the industrial and applied market due to strong demand for our innovative products serving this market. Revenue to customers in the diagnostics and healthcare market declined as we navigated headwinds in China. During the third quarter of 2025, sales grew in North America. Sales growth was strong in Europe and Asia-Pacific, despite weak economic activity in China. Contributions to organic revenue during the third quarter of 2025 were led by the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services and Life Sciences Solutions segments.\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, revenues grew in the pharma and biotech market due to increased demand from customers, partially offset by reduced demand for COVID-19 vaccine and therapy related products and services. Revenues in the academic and government market declined, driven by customer hesitancy in a more uncertain environment in the U.S. and macro conditions in China. Revenue to customers in the industrial and applied market grew. Revenue to customers in the diagnostics and healthcare market declined slightly. During the first nine months of 2025, sales grew in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, but declined in China. Contributions to organic revenue during the first nine months of 2025 were led by the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services and Life Sciences Solutions segments.   \nThe company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars:\n•\nHigh-impact innovation,\n•\nOur trusted partner status with customers, and\n•\nOur unparalleled commercial engine.\nGAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin increased in the third quarter of 2025 due primarily to very strong productivity improvements, partially offset by strategic investments, the impact of tariffs and related foreign currency effects, and unfavorable business mix. GAAP operating income margin in the third quarter of 2025 was also impacted by higher levels of restructuring and other charges incurred for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations (Note 6). \nGAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin increased the first nine months of 2025 due primarily to very strong productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable business mix. GAAP operating income margin in the first nine months of 2025 benefited from lower amortization expense when compared to 2024; however, this was partially offset by higher levels of restructuring and other charges incurred for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations (Note 6). \nThe company’s references to strategic investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system to address inflation, including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.\nNotable Recent Acquisitions\nOn July 10, 2024, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Olink Holding AB (publ), a Swedish-based provider of next-generation proteomics solutions. The acquisition enhances the segment’s capabilities in the high-growth proteomics market with the addition of highly differentiated solutions. It also complements the existing life sciences and mass spectrometry offerings, accelerating protein biomarker discovery and providing strong synergy opportunities.\nOn September 1, 2025, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Solventum Corporation’s Purification and Filtration business, which became the company’s filtration and separation business, a leading provider of \n29\nTHERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\npurification and filtration technologies used in the production of biologics as well as in medical technologies and industrial applications. The business strengthens the segment’s bioproduction offerings with advanced filtration technologies that improve quality and efficiency across upstream and downstream workflows. In addition, its industrial filtration and membrane solutions will expand our reach into industries including battery, semiconductor and medical device manufacturing.   \nSegment Results\nThe company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits as defined in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the company’s \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\n for 2024. Accordingly, the following segment data are reported on this basis.\nThree months ended\nNine months ended\n(Dollars in millions)\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\nRevenues\nLife Sciences Solutions\n$\n2,588 \n$\n2,387 \n$\n7,428 \n$\n7,027 \nAnalytical Instruments\n1,893 \n1,808 \n5,339 \n5,277 \nSpecialty Diagnostics\n1,174 \n1,129 \n3,456 \n3,355 \nLaboratory Products and Biopharma Services\n5,970 \n5,740 \n17,605 \n17,221 \nEliminations\n(503)\n(467)\n(1,487)\n(1,397)\nConsolidated revenues\n$\n11,122 \n$\n10,598 \n$\n32,341 \n$\n31,484 \nLife Sciences Solutions\nThree months ended\nOrganic \n(non-GAAP measure)\n(Dollars in millions)\nSeptember 27,\n2025\nSeptember 28,\n2024\nTotal\nChange\nAcquisitions/ Divestitures\nCurrency\nTranslation\nRevenues\n$\n2,588 \n$\n2,387 \n8 \n%\n3 \n%\n1 \n%\n5 \n%\nSegment income\n968 \n845 \n15 \n%\nSegment income margin\n37.4 \n%\n35.4 \n%\n2.0 \n pt\nThe increase in organic revenues in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by the bioproduction business.

In the third quarter and first nine months of 2025, the company’s net interest expense was reduced by approximately $66 million and $199 million, respectively, as a result of its interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, the company’s net interest expense was reduced by approximately $66 million and $197 million, respectively, as a result of its interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements (Note 10).\nGAAP other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains/losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities, and net periodic pension benefit cost/income, excluding the service cost component. GAAP other income/(expense) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 also includes $7 million and $9 million, respectively, of net gains on investments, and $2 million and $8 million, respectively, of settlement charges for pension plans. GAAP other income/(expense) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 also includes $(3) million and $7 million, respectively, of net gains/(losses) on investments.\nThe company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates in the third quarter of 2025 were impacted by an $86 million tax benefit from tax return reassessments. The company’s GAAP tax rate in the third quarter of 2025 was also impacted by tax legislation enacted during the quarter (Note 7).\n32\nTHERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\nThe company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates in the first nine months of 2025 were impacted by a $125 million deferred tax benefit resulting from the recognition of a tax attribute related to a domestication transaction, a deferred tax benefit of $153 million related to capital losses generated as part of intra-entity transactions, a $93 million benefit in jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized due to forecasted income, and an $86 million tax benefit from tax return reassessments (Note 7). \nThe company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates in the first nine months of 2024 were impacted by $176 million of expense, net, for a provision associated with a tax audit recorded in the first quarter of 2024. The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates in the first nine months of 2024 were also impacted by tax benefits of $183 million and $124 million, in the second and third quarters of 2024, respectively, primarily in jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized due to forecasted income. The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates in the first nine months of 2024 were also impacted by $102 million of tax benefits resulting from capital losses generated as part of intra-entity transactions (Note 7).\nThe effective tax rates in both 2025 and 2024 were also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes are higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and are expected to total approximately $1.70 billion in 2025.\nThe company expects its GAAP effective tax rate in 2025 will be between 8% and 10% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company expects its adjusted tax rate will be approximately 10.5% in 2025.\nThe company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income.\nEquity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities was impacted by an $88 million impairment of an equity method investment in the second quarter of 2024.\nWeighted average diluted shares decreased in 2025 compared to 2024, primarily due to share repurchases. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. The company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends.\n(In millions)\nSeptember 27, 2025\nDecember 31, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,982 \n$\n4,009 \nShort-term investments\n1,564 \n1,561 \nTotal debt\n35,681 \n31,275 \nApproximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable intercompany transactions, including loans and returns of capital, as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. \nThe company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. \nAs of September 27, 2025, the company’s short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations totaled $3.82 billion. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 3). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of September 27, 2025, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit.\n33\nTHERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n \nNine months ended\n(In millions)\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n4,361 \n$\n5,377 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(4,938)\n(5,861)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(1,725)\n(3,126)\nFree cash flow \n(non-GAAP measure)\n3,319 \n4,498 \nOperating Activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Changes in other assets and liabilities used cash of $1.21 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.60 billion during the first nine months of 2025.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. An increase in inventories used cash of $0.22 billion. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $0.24 billion. Changes in other assets and liabilities used cash of $0.24 billion primarily due to the timing of payments for compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.43 billion during the first nine months of 2024.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, acquisitions used cash of $4.04 billion. The company’s investing activities also included purchases of $1.06 billion for the purchase of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, acquisitions used cash of $3.13 billion. The company’s investing activities also included purchases of short-term investments of $2.07 billion, as well as $0.92 billion of purchases of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments.\nThe company expects that for all of 2025, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, issuance of debt and net commercial paper activity provided $3.34 billion of cash. Repayment of debt used cash of $1.63 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock (2.1 million shares), of which $0.04 billion settled in the fourth quarter of 2025, and the payment of $0.47 billion in cash dividends. On November 15, 2024, the Board of Directors announced that it replaced the existing authorization to repurchase the company’s common stock, of which $1.00 billion was remaining, with a new authorization to repurchase up to $4.00 billion of the company’s common stock. All of the shares of common stock repurchased by the company during the first nine months of 2025 were under this program, depleting the 2024 authorization. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2025, the company issued $2.50 billion of senior notes (Note 3).\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, issuance of debt provided $1.20 billion of cash. Repayment of senior notes used $1.11 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock (5.5 million shares) and the payment of $0.43 billion in cash dividends. \nThe company’s commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, contractual obligations and other commercial commitments, did not change materially subsequent to December 31, 2024, except in connection with the completion of the filtration and separation business acquisition, which occurred on September 1, 2025, as well as the agreement to acquire Clario Holdings, Inc. (Note 12).\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to \n34\nTHERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\nprevious periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n•\nCertain transaction-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction-related third-party costs, changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n•\nCosts/income associated with restructuring activities and large-scale abandonments of product lines, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities and large-scale abandonment of product lines are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n•\nEquity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. \n•\nThe expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.\n•\nThe noncontrolling interest and tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate/law changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\nWe report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less net capital expenditures, to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. The company also uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures of the company’s results of operations and cash flows included in this Form 10-Q are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for the company’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth within the “Consolidated Results” and “Segment Results” sections and below. \nThree months ended\nNine months ended\nSeptember 27,\nSeptember 28,\nSeptember 27,\nSeptember 28,\n(Dollars in millions except per share amounts)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nReconciliation of adjusted operating income\nGAAP operating income\n$\n1,941 \n$\n1,838 \n$\n5,491 \n$\n5,321 \nCost of revenues adjustments (a)\n10 \n9 \n31 \n25 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses adjustments (b)\n66 \n21 \n99 \n(24)\nRestructuring and other costs (c)\n135 \n45 \n316 \n151 \nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n435 \n450 \n1,294 \n1,514 \nAdjusted operating income \n(non-GAAP measure)\n$\n2,587 \n$\n2,362 \n$\n7,231 \n$\n6,987 \nReconciliation of adjusted operating income margin\nGAAP operating income margin\n17.4 \n%\n17.3 \n%\n17.0 \n%\n16.9 \n%\nCost of revenues adjustments (a)\n0.1 \n%\n0.1 \n%\n0.1 \n%\n0.1 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses adjustments (b)\n0.6 \n%\n0.2 \n%\n0.3 \n%\n(0.1)\n%\nRestructuring and other costs (c)\n1.2 \n%\n0.4 \n%\n1.0 \n%\n0.5 \n%\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n3.9 \n%\n4.2 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n4.8 \n%\nAdjusted operating income margin (\nnon-GAAP measure)\n23.3 \n%\n22.3 \n%\n22.4 \n%\n22.2 \n%\nReconciliation of adjusted other income/(expense)\nGAAP other income/(expense)\n$\n(2)\n$\n(16)\n$\n(18)\n$\n(2)\nAdjustments (d)\n(5)\n3 \n(1)\n(8)\nAdjusted other income/(expense) \n(non-GAAP measure)\n$\n(7)\n$\n(13)\n$\n(19)\n$\n(10)\n35\nTHERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\nThree months ended\nNine months ended\nSeptember 27,\nSeptember 28,\nSeptember 27,\nSeptember 28,\n(Dollars in millions except per share amounts)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nReconciliation of adjusted tax rate\nGAAP tax rate\n11.3 \n%\n5.7 \n%\n7.6 \n%\n10.0 \n%\nAdjustments (e)\n(0.3)\n%\n4.8 \n%\n2.7 \n%\n0.3 \n%\nAdjusted tax rate \n(non-GAAP measure)\n11.0 \n%\n10.5 \n%\n10.4 \n%\n10.3 \n%\nReconciliation of adjusted earnings per share\nGAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) attributable to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n$\n4.27 \n$\n4.25 \n$\n12.53 \n$\n11.75 \nCost of revenues adjustments (a)\n0.03 \n0.02 \n0.08 \n0.07 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses adjustments (b)\n0.17 \n0.05 \n0.26 \n(0.06)\nRestructuring and other costs (c)\n0.36 \n0.12 \n0.83 \n0.39 \nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n1.15 \n1.17 \n3.42 \n3.95 \nOther income/expense adjustments (d)\n(0.01)\n0.01 \n0.00 \n(0.02)\nIncome taxes adjustments (e)\n(0.17)\n(0.36)\n(0.85)\n(0.50)\nEquity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities\n(0.01)\n0.04 \n0.02 \n0.20 \nNoncontrolling interests adjustments (f)\n0.00 \n(0.02)\n0.00 \n(0.02)\nAdjusted EPS\n (non-GAAP measure)\n$\n5.79 \n$\n5.28 \n$\n16.30 \n$\n15.76 \nReconciliation of free cash flow\nGAAP net cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,239 \n$\n2,167 \n$\n4,361 \n$\n5,377 \nPurchases of property, plant and equipment\n(404)\n(271)\n(1,060)\n(920)\nProceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment\n5 \n20 \n17 \n40 \nFree cash flow\n (non-GAAP measure)\n$\n1,840 \n$\n1,915 \n$\n3,319 \n$\n4,498 \n(a)\nAdjusted results exclude accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and charges for the sale of inventory revalued at the date of acquisition.
