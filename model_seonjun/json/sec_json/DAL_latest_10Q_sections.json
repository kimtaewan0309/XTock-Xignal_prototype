MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n \nOF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in our 2024 Form 10-K.\nSeptember 2025 Quarter Financial Highlights\nOur operating income for the September 2025 quarter was\n \n$1.7 billion, an increase of $287 million compared to the September 2024 quarter.\nRevenue. \nCompared to the September 2024 quarter, our total revenue increased $1.0 billion. Passenger revenue increased $399 million compared to the September 2024 quarter on an increase in revenue for premium products, particularly from corporate customers, and loyalty travel awards, taking into account the impact of the CrowdStrike-caused outage on the September 2024 quarter. In July 2024, our operations were significantly disrupted by the CrowdStrike-caused outage. We estimate that this disruption led to a direct revenue impact of approximately $380 million related to approximately 7,000 flight cancellations over five days. Total revenue, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes revenue related to refinery sales to third parties) increased in the September 2025 quarter by $603 million, or 4.1%, compared to the September 2024 quarter.\nOperating Expense. \nTotal operating expense in the September 2025 quarter increased $709 million, or 5%, compared to the September 2024 quarter, primarily due to costs associated with a 4% increase in capacity, higher expenses related to refinery sales to third parties and higher employee costs from increased wages, largely offset by lower aircraft fuel costs and higher costs in the September 2024 quarter associated with the CrowdStrike-caused outage. The 2024 CrowdStrike-caused outage and operational recovery resulted in approximately $170 million of additional operating expenses primarily due to customer expense reimbursements and crew-related costs. September 2024 quarter fuel expense was also approximately $50 million lower than it would have been as a result of the flight cancellations. Total operating expense, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure, which primarily excludes expenses related to refinery sales to third parties) in the September 2025 quarter increased $281 million, or 2%, compared to the September 2024 quarter, primarily for the reasons discussed above.\nOur total operating cost per available seat mile (\"CASM\") increased 1% compared to the September 2024 quarter, while non-fuel unit cost (\"CASM-Ex\", a non-GAAP financial measure) increased 0.3%.\nCash Flow\n. Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate undrawn principal amount available under our revolving credit facilities (\"liquidity\") as of September 30, 2025 was $6.9 billion.\nDuring the September 2025 quarter, operating activities generated $1.8 billion, primarily from ticket sales and the sale of SkyMiles to our partners. Total cash sales to American Express were approximately $2.0 billion in the September 2025 quarter.\nCash flows used in investing activities during the quarter totaled $1.0 billion primarily from capital expenditures. These operating and investing activities yielded free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) of $833 million in the September 2025 quarter. Additionally we had cash outflows of $459 million related to repayments of our debt and finance leases.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures referenced above for total revenue, adjusted, operating expense, adjusted, CASM-Ex and free cash flow are defined and reconciled in \"Supplemental Information\" below.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | September 2025 Form 10-Q\n18\nItem 2.

Domestic revenue increased due to strong demand for our premium products, particularly from corporate customers.\nInternational\nInternational passenger revenue for the September 2025 quarter decreased compared to the September 2024 quarter. The decrease in the Atlantic region is primarily driven by lower main cabin revenue, while premium products continued to perform well, and a shift in some leisure travel out of peak summer months. The decrease in Latin America region revenue primarily relates to reduced demand for Mexico leisure markets. Pacific region revenue growth reflects our network restoration in addition to increased load factor, particularly to China and Japan.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | September 2025 Form 10-Q\n19\nItem 2.

See \"Refinery Segment\" below for additional details on the refinery's operations, including third party refinery sales.\nLoyalty Program.\n This relates to revenues from brand usage by third parties and other performance obligations embedded in miles sold, as well as redemption of miles for non-air travel and other awards. These revenues are mainly driven by customer spend on American Express cards and new cardholder acquisitions.\nAncillary Businesses. \nThis includes revenues from aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation package operations. The increase is attributable to higher volume of engine repairs by our aircraft maintenance services operation during the September 2025 quarter.\nMiscellaneous. \nThis is primarily composed of revenues related to lounge access, including access provided to certain American Express cardholders, codeshare agreements, international joint venture partnership contractual settlements and certain other commercial relationships.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | September 2025 Form 10-Q\n20\nItem 2.

We expect that fuel consumption for the remainder of 2025 will increase compared to 2024 aligned with capacity, partially offset by improvements in the fuel efficiency from our recent aircraft acquisitions. The refinery generated a benefit of five cents per gallon compared to an incremental cost of three cents per gallon in the September 2024 quarter. We expect jet fuel prices to remain dynamic.\nSee \"Refinery Segment\" below for additional details on the refinery's operations.\nFuel expense and average price per gallon\nAverage Price Per Gallon\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nIncrease (Decrease)\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nIncrease (Decrease)\n(in millions, except per gallon data)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nFuel purchase cost\n(1)\n$\n2,612 \n$\n2,738 \n$\n(126)\n$\n2.30 \n$\n2.50 \n$\n(0.20)\nFuel hedge impact\n11 \n(24)\n35 \n0.01 \n(0.02)\n0.03 \nRefinery segment impact\n(53)\n33 \n(86)\n(0.05)\n0.03 \n(0.08)\nTotal fuel expense\n$\n2,570 \n$\n2,747 \n$\n(177)\n$\n2.26 \n$\n2.51 \n$\n(0.25)\n(1)\nMarket price for jet fuel at airport locations, including related taxes and transportation costs.\nAncillary Businesses and Refinery.\n Ancillary businesses and refinery includes expenses associated with refinery sales to third parties, aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation package operations. Refinery sales to third parties increased $393 million compared to the September 2024 quarter. See \"Refinery Segment\" below for additional details on the refinery's operations, including third party refinery sales.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents.\n The increase in landing fees and other rents resulted from higher rates charged by airports following extensive redevelopment projects at numerous facilities and more flights compared to the September 2024 quarter.\nProfit Sharing.\n Profit sharing increased by $72 million due to higher quarterly results compared to the September 2024 quarter. Our profit sharing program pays 10% to all eligible employees for the first $2.5 billion of annual profit, as defined by the terms of the program, and 20% of annual profit above $2.5 billion.\nOther.\n The decrease in other is primarily due to the impact of service recovery costs including customer expense reimbursements from the CrowdStrike-caused outage in the September 2024 quarter.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | September 2025 Form 10-Q\n21\nItem 2.

This decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced interest expense resulting from our debt reduction initiatives. During 2024, we made payments of $4.0 billion related to our debt and finance lease obligations. We have continued to pay down our debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 with $3.9 billion of payments on debt and finance lease obligations. During the June 2025 quarter, we issued $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes and used a portion of the proceeds to repay the Payroll Support Program loan due 2030 (\"PSP1 Loan\"). The new unsecured notes carry a lower interest rate than the repaid PSP1 Loan. We continue to seek opportunities to pre-pay our debt, in addition to periodic amortization and scheduled maturities, and refinance higher cost debt.\nGain/(loss) on investments, net. \nChanges in the valuation of investments accounted for at fair value are recorded in gain/(loss) on investments, net and are driven by changes in stock prices, foreign currency fluctuations and other valuation techniques for investments in certain companies, particularly those without publicly-traded shares. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our equity investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt.\n Loss on extinguishment of debt reflects the losses incurred in the early repayment of certain loans and notes.\nMiscellaneous, net.\n Miscellaneous, net primarily includes employee benefit plans net periodic cost, charitable contributions, our share of our equity method investments' results, dividends received from our equity investees and foreign exchange gains/(losses).\nIncome Taxes\nIn certain periods, we may have adjustments to our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of changes in prior year estimates, the valuation allowance on mark-to-market adjustments on our equity investments and tax laws enacted during the period, which will impact the effective tax rate for that period. Excluding the mark-to-market gains recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we project our annual effective tax rate for 2025 will be 24% to 25%.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, was signed into law. The legislation did not have a material impact on our income tax expense for the September 2025 quarter, and we do not expect it to materially change our effective income tax rate for 2025.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | September 2025 Form 10-Q\n24\nItem 2. MD&A - Refinery Segment\nRefinery Segment\nThe refinery operated by Monroe primarily produces gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Monroe exchanges non-jet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations. The jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery typically provides approximately 200,000 barrels per day, or approximately 75% of our consumption, for use in our airline operations. The refinery regularly optimizes its sales and exchange activities based on market conditions. A change in contractual agreements to buy and sell products with separate counterparties drove a decrease in exchanged products and increase in third party refinery sales during the current year compared to the prior year.\nThe refinery generated operating income of $42 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $76 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of lower pricing of refined products.\nFor more information regarding the refinery's results, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRefinery segment financial information\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nIncrease (Decrease)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nIncrease (Decrease)\n(in millions, except per gallon data)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nExchanged products\n$\n23 \n$\n349 \n$\n(326)\n$\n549 \n$\n1,147 \n$\n(598)\nSales of refined products\n36 \n111 \n(75)\n132 \n197 \n(65)\nSales to airline segment\n260 \n369 \n(109)\n852 \n1,147 \n(295)\nThird party refinery sales\n1,476 \n1,083 \n393 \n3,680 \n3,520 \n160 \nOperating revenue\n$\n1,795 \n$\n1,912 \n$\n(117)\n$\n5,213 \n$\n6,011 \n$\n(798)\nOperating income/(loss)\n$\n53 \n$\n(33)\n$\n86 \n$\n42 \n$\n76 \n$\n(34)\nRefinery segment impact on airline average price per fuel gallon\n$\n(0.05)\n$\n0.03 \n$\n(0.08)\n$\n(0.01)\n$\n(0.02)\n$\n0.01 \nOperating Statistics\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n% Increase (Decrease)\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n% Increase (Decrease)\nConsolidated\n(1)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nRevenue passenger miles (in millions) (\"RPM\")\n67,621 \n66,310 \n2 \n%\n189,717 \n185,757 \n2 \n%\nAvailable seat miles (in millions) (\"ASM\")\n79,054 \n76,162 \n4 \n%\n225,099 \n216,360 \n4 \n%\nPassenger mile yield\n19.97 \n¢\n19.77 \n¢\n1 \n%\n20.48 \n¢\n20.50 \n¢\n— \n%\nPassenger revenue per available seat mile (\"PRASM\")\n17.08 \n¢\n17.21 \n¢\n(1)\n%\n17.26 \n¢\n17.60 \n¢\n(2)\n%\nTotal revenue per available seat mile (\"TRASM\")\n21.09 \n¢\n20.58 \n¢\n2 \n%\n21.04 \n¢\n21.30 \n¢\n(1)\n%\nTRASM, adjusted\n(2)\n19.22 \n¢\n19.16 \n¢\n0.3 \n%\n19.41 \n¢\n19.67 \n¢\n(1)\n%\nCost per available seat mile (\"CASM\")\n18.96 \n¢\n18.75 \n¢\n1 \n%\n19.11 \n¢\n19.32 \n¢\n(1)\n%\nCASM-Ex\n(2)\n13.35 \n¢\n13.30 \n¢\n— \n%\n13.73 \n¢\n13.48 \n¢\n2 \n%\nPassenger load factor\n86 \n %\n87 \n %\n(1)\npt\n84 \n %\n86 \n %\n(2)\npts\nFuel gallons consumed (in millions)\n1,138 \n1,096 \n4 \n%\n3,226 \n3,093 \n4 \n%\nAverage price per fuel gallon\n(3)\n$\n2.26 \n$\n2.51 \n(10)\n%\n$\n2.31 \n$\n2.64 \n(12)\n%\nAverage price per fuel gallon, adjusted\n(2)(3)\n$\n2.25 \n$\n2.53 \n(11)\n%\n$\n2.31 \n$\n2.64 \n(12)\n%\n(1)\nIncludes the operations of our regional carriers under capacity purchase agreements.\n(2)\nNon-GAAP financial measures defined and reconciled to TRASM, CASM and average fuel price per gallon, respectively, in \"Supplemental Information\" below.\n(3)\nIncludes the impact of fuel hedge activity and refinery segment results.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | September 2025 Form 10-Q\n25\nItem 2.

MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity \nAs of September 30, 2025, we had $6.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate undrawn principal amount available under our revolving credit facilities. We expect to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. \nUndrawn Lines of Credit. \nAs of September 30, 2025, we had approximately $3.1 billion undrawn and available under our revolving credit facilities.\nSources and Uses of Liquidity\nOperating Activities\nWe generated cash flows from operations of $6.1 billion in both the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. We expect to continue generating positive cash flows from operations during the remainder of 2025.\nOur operating cash flow is impacted by the following factors:\nSeasonality of Advance Ticket Sales.\n We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date. When we receive a cash payment at the time of sale, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability. The air traffic liability typically increases during the winter and spring months as advance ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months. \nFuel.\n Fuel expense represented approximately 17% and 20% of our total operating expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The market price for jet fuel is dynamic, which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations. Fuel consumption was higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the prior year period due to the increase in capacity. We expect that fuel consumption for the remainder of 2025 will increase compared to 2024 aligned with capacity, partially offset by improvements in the fuel efficiency from our recent aircraft acquisitions.\nProfit Sharing.\n We paid $1.4 billion in profit sharing payments in February 2025 related to our 2024 pre-tax profit in recognition of our employees' contributions toward achieving the year's financial results.\nOur broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to eligible employees. In determining the amount of profit sharing, the program defines profit as pre-tax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we accrued $986 million in profit sharing expense based on the year-to-date performance and current expectations for 2025 profit.\nSale of Miles to Participating Companies.\n Customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card, retail, ridesharing, car rental and hotel companies with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles. Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period. Our most significant contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. Total cash sales to American Express were $5.9 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year period. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the cash sales from marketing agreements.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | September 2025 Form 10-Q\n27\nItem 2. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity\nInvesting Activities\n \nCapital Expenditures. \nOur capital expenditures were $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion\n \nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We have committed to future aircraft purchases and have obtained, but are under no obligation to use, long-term financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of the aircraft. Our expected 2025 capital spend of approximately $5.0 billion will be primarily for aircraft, including deliveries and advance deposit payments, as well as fleet modifications and technology enhancements.\nFinancing Activities\nDebt and Finance Leases. \nIn the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we had cash outflows of $3.9 billion related to repayments of our debt and finance lease obligations. We continue to seek opportunities to pre-pay our debt, in addition to periodic amortization and scheduled maturities, and refinance higher cost debt.\nIn June 2025, we issued $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amounts of unsecured notes, consisting of $1.0 billion of 4.95% Notes due 2028 and $1.0 billion of 5.25% Notes due 2030 (collectively, the \"Notes\"). The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes were used to repay the PSP1 Loan and for general corporate purposes.\nIn September 2025, we and our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary SkyMiles IP Ltd. entered into an amendment to the SkyMiles term loan credit and guaranty agreement (the \"SkyMiles Credit Facility\"). This amendment, among other things, (i) refinanced the existing term loans with the proceeds of replacement term loans bearing interest at a variable rate equal to an adjusted term SOFR, plus a reduced margin of 1.50% per annum, payable quarterly; (ii) extended the scheduled maturity from October 2027 to October 2028; (iii) reduced the principal amortization payments from 20% to 1% per year, payable quarterly; and (iv) added a prepayment premium of 1.00% payable in connection with a Repricing Event (as defined in the amended SkyMiles Credit Facility) occurring within six months following September 30, 2025.\nIn February 2025, Moody's credit rating agency upgraded its rating for Delta to Baa2, an investment grade rating. In the September 2025 quarter, Fitch Ratings upgraded its outlook for Delta to Positive from Stable.\nSee Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our debt agreements.\nCapital Return to Shareholders. \nOn August 21, 2025 we paid the dividend previously declared in the June 2025 quarter for total cash dividends of $122 million. Total cash dividends for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were $318 million.\nOn September 25, 2025, the Board of Directors approved and we will pay a quarterly dividend of $0.1875 per share on November 6, 2025 to shareholders of record as of October 16, 2025.\nIn the June 2025 quarter, the Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion opportunistic share repurchase program open through June 30, 2028. No shares were repurchased under this program through September 30, 2025.\nCovenants. \nWe were in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements at September 30, 2025.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThere have been no material changes in our Critical Accounting Estimates from the information provided in the \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" section of \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Form 10-K.\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | September 2025 Form 10-Q\n28\nItem 2. MD&A - Supplemental Information\nSupplemental Information\nWe sometimes use information (non-GAAP financial measures) that is derived from the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.\nIncluded below are reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used within this Form 10-Q to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations below may not calculate exactly due to rounding. These reconciliations include certain adjustments to GAAP measures to provide comparability between the reported periods, if applicable, and for the reasons indicated below:\n•\nThird-party refinery sales. \nRefinery sales to third parties, and related expenses, are not related to our airline segment. Excluding these sales therefore provides a more meaningful comparison of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry.\n•\nMTM adjustments and settlements on hedges.\n Mark-to-market (\"MTM\") adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period, and therefore we remove this impact to allow investors to better understand and analyze our core performance. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the applicable period.\n•\nAircraft fuel and related taxes. \nThe volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance. The adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and year-over-year financial performance.\n•\nProfit sharing.\n We adjust for profit sharing because this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry.\nTotal revenue, adjusted reconciliation\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nTotal revenue\n$\n16,673 \n$\n15,677 \nAdjusted for:\nThird-party refinery sales\n(1,476)\n(1,083)\nTotal revenue, adjusted\n$\n15,197 \n$\n14,594 \nOperating expense, adjusted reconciliation\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\nOperating expense\n$\n14,989 \n$\n14,280 \nAdjusted for:\nThird-party refinery sales\n(1,476)\n(1,083)\nMTM adjustments and settlements on hedges\n(11)\n24 \nOperating expense, adjusted\n$\n13,502 \n$\n13,221 \nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | September 2025 Form 10-Q\n29\nItem 2.
