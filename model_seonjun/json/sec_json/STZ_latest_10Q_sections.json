MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nINTRODUCTION\nThis MD&A provides additional information on our businesses, current developments, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. It should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in our 2025 Annual Report. This MD&A is organized as follows:\nOverview\nThis section provides a general description of our business, which we believe is important in understanding the results of our operations, financial condition, and potential future trends.\nStrategy\nThis section provides a description of our strategy, including our 2025 Restructuring Initiative, and significant divestitures, acquisitions, and investments.\nResults of operations\nThis section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented on a business segment basis for the three months ended August 31, 2025, and August 31, 2024, and six months ended August 31, 2025, and August 31, 2024. In addition, a brief description of significant transactions and other items that affect the comparability of the results is provided.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nThis section provides an analysis of our cash flows, outstanding debt, and liquidity position. Included in the analysis of outstanding debt is a discussion of the financial capacity available to fund our on-going operations and future commitments, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an international producer and marketer of beer, wine, and spirits with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy with powerful, consumer-connected, high-quality brands like Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Pacifico, Robert Mondavi Winery, Kim Crawford, The Prisoner Wine Company, High West, Casa Noble, and Mi CAMPO. In the U.S., we are one of the top growth contributors at retail among beverage alcohol suppliers. We are also the second-largest beer company and have the #1 beer brand, Modelo Especial, in dollar sales in the U.S. We continued to strengthen our leadership position in the U.S. beer market as the #1 dollar share gainer in the high-end and the overall \nConstellation Brands, Inc. Q2 FY 2026 Form 10-Q\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR    I    30\nMD&A\nTable of Contents\nU.S. beer market. Within wine and spirits, we have implemented a multi-year strategy that repositioned this business to a portfolio of exclusively higher-end brands that we believe will generate higher growth and higher margins, aligned to our focus on consumer-led premiumization trends, and we continue to progressively expand our supply channels through DTC and international markets. The strength of our brands makes us a supplier of choice to many of our consumers and our customers, which include wholesale distributors, retailers, and on-premise locations. We conduct our business through entities we wholly own as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities.\nO\nur internal management financial reporting consists of \ntwo business divisions: (i) Beer and (ii) Wine and Spirits and \nwe report our operating results in three\n segments: (i)\n \nBeer, (ii)\n \nWine and Spirits, and (iii) Corporate Operations and Other. \nIn the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported beer brands and ABAs. We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to produce our Mexican beer portfolio and to import, market, and sell such portfolio in the U.S. In the Wine and Spirits segment, we sell a \nportfolio comprised of \nexclusively \nhigher-end wine and\n spirits brands. Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of corporate communications, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate strategy, executive management, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, IT, legal, and public affairs, \nas well as our investments such as those made through our corporate venture capital function\n. All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are, therefore, not allocated to the other reportable segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our CODM’s evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments. \nThe business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.\nGoodwill impairment\nAs of August 31, 2024, in connection with negative trends within our Wine and Spirits business primarily attributable to our U.S. wholesale market, driven by declines in both the overall wine market and in our then-owned mainstream and premium wine brands, management updated its Fiscal 2025 outlook for this reporting unit. Based on the aforementioned factors, we performed an interim quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment which indicated that the carrying value of the Wine and Spirits reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, resulting in a $2,250.0 million goodwill impairment. This loss from impairment was included in goodwill impairment within our consolidated results for Second Quarter 2025 and Six Months 2025. See Notes 7, 8, and 12 for further discussion.\nSTRATEGY\nOur overall strategic vision is to consistently deliver industry-leading total stockholder returns over the long-term through a focus on these key pillars:\n•\ncontinue building strong brands people love with advantaged routes to market;\n•\nbuild a culture that is consumer-obsessed and leverages robust innovation capabilities to stay on the forefront of consumer trends;\n•\ndeploy capital in line with disciplined and balanced priorities;\n•\ndeliver on impactful environmental, social, and governance initiatives that we believe are not only good business, but also good for the world; and\n•\nempower the whole enterprise to achieve best-in-class operational efficiency.\nWe will continue to strive for success by ensuring consumer-led decision making drives all aspects of our business; building a strong talent pipeline with best-in-class people development; investing in infrastructure that supports and enables our business, including data systems and architecture; and exemplifying intentional and proactive fiscal management. We place focus on positioning our portfolio on higher-margin, higher-growth categories of the beverage alcohol industry to align with our strategy to address consumer-led premiumization, product, and purchasing trends, which we anticipate will continue to drive faster growth rates relative to the industry. To continue capitalizing on \nConstellation Brands, Inc. Q2 FY 2026 Form 10-Q\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR    I    31\nMD&A\nTable of Contents\nconsumer-led premiumization trends, become more competitive, and grow our business, we have employed a strategy dedicated to organic growth and supplemented by targeted investments and acquisitions. Our ongoing digital acceleration initiatives are aimed at driving results by enhancing our technology capabilities in key areas. In Fiscal 2026, we continue to focus on end-to-end digital supply chain planning, logistics, procurement, revenue growth management, and consumer insights and analytics. Additionally, we believe our continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet provides a solid financial foundation to support our broader strategic initiatives.\nOur business strategy for the Beer segment focuses on upholding our leadership position in the U.S. beer market, including as a leader in the high-end segment, and continuing to grow our high-end imported beer brands through maintenance of leading margins, enhancements to our results of operations and operating cash flow, and exploring new avenues for growth. In Fiscal 2026, we intend to increase distribution for key brands, optimize growth through differentiated brand positioning, price pack architecture, and market prioritization as well as continue to invest in the next phase of modular capacity additions necessary to support our anticipated future growth expectations. Expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities continue under our Mexico Beer Projects. Additionally, we continue to focus on consumer-led innovation by creating new line extensions behind celebrated, trusted brands and package formats, as well as new to world brands, that are intended to meet emerging needs.\nOur business strategy for the Wine and Spirits segment continues to focus on delivering growth and improving margins beyond Fiscal 2026 by driving our higher-end brands and operating efficiencies. We have repositioned this business to a portfolio of exclusively higher-end wine and spirits brands that we believe will generate higher growth and higher margins. We remain a key supplier in U.S. 3-tier brick-and-mortar distribution. In addition, we are advancing our aim to become a global, omni-channel competitor in line with evolving consumer preferences as we continue our efforts to progressively expand into international markets, DTC channels (including hospitality), and 3-tier eCommerce.\nMarketing, sales, and distribution of our products are primarily managed on a geographic basis allowing us to leverage leading market positions. In addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets. Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, ABA, and branded wine and spirits categories, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i)\n \nour beer portfolio and (ii)\n \nour wine and spirits portfolio. The environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.\nWe remain committed to our long-term financial model of: growing sales, expanding margins, and increasing cash flow in order to continue to achieve comparable earnings per share growth as well as our target ratios for (i) comparable net leverage and (ii) dividend payout; investing to support the growth of our business; and delivering additional returns to stockholders through periodic share repurchases. Our results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be affected by the evolving consumer demand environment largely driven by what we believe to be ongoing socioeconomic factors. These factors may include subdued spend, depressed sentiment, value-seeking behaviors, and reductions in the discretionary income available to purchase our products among consumers, elevated unemployment, changing prices, inflation, other unfavorable global and regional economic conditions, demographic trends in the U.S., global supply chain disruptions and constraints, and geopolitical events, including the impact of military conflicts.\nRecent developments in international trade relations, including significant changes in U.S. trade policy and actions which include threatened, new, and increased tariffs on other countries and retaliatory tariffs and actions imposed on certain U.S. goods have produced heightened uncertainty with respect to trade and tariff policies and regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, which could continue to alter the global trade environment. For example, the U.S. government has imposed tariffs on product imports, including on raw and packaging materials, from certain countries (such as Mexico, the European Union including Italy, and New Zealand) and certain other countries have implemented tariffs on U.S. goods, such as the tariffs on certain product imports originating from the U.S. imposed by the Canadian government, although some of these tariffs were subsequently modified or delayed.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. Q2 FY 2026 Form 10-Q\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR    I    32\nMD&A\nTable of Contents\nWe expect some or all of these market conditions and their impacts to continue in Fiscal 2026 which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We intend to continue to monitor the evolving consumer demand and socioeconomic environments and their impacts on our business. In addition, we have implemented the 2025 Restructuring Initiative, which is an enterprise-wide cost savings and restructuring initiative designed to help optimize the performance of our business, including through enhanced organizational efficiency and optimized expenditures across our organization. We also intend to continue our commodity and foreign exchange hedging programs. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately respond to softer consumer demand trends or fully mitigate rising costs, including as a result of new or increased tariffs, through increased selling prices, cost, productivity, efficiency, and inventory management initiatives, optimized marketing plans, and/or our commodity and foreign exchange hedging programs. Furthermore, to the extent severe weather events that impact our business, such as wildfires, droughts, floods, extreme heat, and/or late frosts, or other weather conditions that constrain purchasing occasions for our consumers, continue to occur or accelerate in future periods, it could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\n2025 Restructuring Initiative\nWe have implemented the 2025 Restructuring Initiative which is expected to yield over $200 million in net annualized cost savings by Fiscal 2028. The majority of the work associated with the 2025 Restructuring Initiative is expected to be completed within Fiscal 2026 and is estimated to result in $80 million to $100 million of cumulative pre-tax costs once all phases are fully implemented. In connection with the 2025 Restructuring Initiative, we recognized $21.6 million of pre-tax restructuring costs in Six Months 2026 and $71.3 million of cumulative pre-tax costs since the inception of this initiative. These costs were included in selling, general, and administrative costs within our consolidated results. For additional information on the 2025 Restructuring Initiative, refer to Note 3.\nDivestitures, Acquisitions, and Investments\nBeer segment\nMexicali Brewery sale\nIn July 2024, we sold the remaining assets classified as held for sale at the canceled Mexicali Brewery.\nWine and Spirits segment\n2025 Wine Divestitures\nOn June 2, 2025, we sold and, in certain instances, exclusively licensed the trademarks of a portion of our wine and spirits business, primarily centered around our then-owned mainstream wine brands and associated inventory, wineries, vineyards, offices, and facilities for $846.5 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The net cash proceeds from the 2025 Wine Divestitures were used for the repayment of debt. Prior to the completion of the 2025 Wine Divestitures, we recorded the results of operations of the divested and exclusively licensed brands in the Wine and Spirits segment.\nSVEDKA Divestiture\nOn January 6, 2025, we sold the SVEDKA brand and related assets, primarily including inventory and equipment. The net cash proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including funding share repurchases, capital expenditures, and repayment of debt. Prior to the completion of the SVEDKA Divestiture, we recorded the results of operations of the SVEDKA brand in the Wine and Spirits segment.\nNelson’s Green Brier investment\nIn October 2024, we purchased the remaining 25% noncontrolling interest in Nelson’s Green Brier, a portfolio of Tennessee-based craft bourbon and whiskey products.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. Q2 FY 2026 Form 10-Q\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR    I    33\nMD&A\nTable of Contents\nSea Smoke acquisition\nIn June 2024, we acquired the Sea Smoke business, including a California-based luxury wine brand, vineyards, and a production facility. This transaction also included the acquisition of goodwill, inventory, and a trademark. The results of operations of Sea Smoke are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.\nThese Wine and Spirits segment activities support our strategic focus on consumer-led premiumization trends and meeting the evolving needs of our consumers.\nCorporate Operations and Other segment\nCorporate ventures investments\nAs of August 31, 2025, and August 31, 2024, we evaluated certain equity method investments, made through our corporate venture capital function, and determined there were other-than-temporary impairments due to business underperformance, for the respective periods.\nCanopy investment\nWe have an investment in Canopy, a North American cannabis and CPG company providing medical and adult-use cannabis products, which expands our portfolio into adjacent categories.\nExchangeable Shares\nIn April 2024, we elected to convert our Canopy common shares and exchange a portion of the principal amount of a promissory note issued to us by Canopy. As a result of these transactions, we (i) have 26.3 million Exchangeable Shares and (ii) recognized an $83.3 million net gain based on the fair value of Exchangeable Shares on the date of the conversion and exchange. This net gain is included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results for Six Months 2025.\nAs of February 28, 2025, we evaluated the Exchangeable Shares for impairment primarily due to the continued decline in Canopy’s common share price. We concluded that an impairment did exist, and accordingly, the Exchangeable Shares were written down to their estimated fair value of $21.2 million.\nFor additional information on these divestitures, acquisitions, and investments refer to Notes 2, 10, and 11.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFinancial Highlights\nReferences to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impacts of the 2025 Wine Divestitures and the SVEDKA Divestiture, collectively referred to as the “Wine and Spirits Divestitures,” where appropriate.\nSecond Quarter 2026 compared to Second Quarter 2025\nNet sales decreased 15%\n \ndue to (i) the loss of net sales as a result of the Wine and Spirits Divestitures, (ii) a decrease in Beer net sales driven primarily by a shipment volume decline, partially offset by a favorable impact from pricing, and (iii) a decline in organic Wine and Spirits net sales driven by changes in financial and volume related contractual obligations with distributors.\nOperating income increased 171%\n largely due to a Second Quarter 2025 Wine and Spirits goodwill impairment and a successful execution of efficiency and cost optimization initiatives within the Beer segment, partially offset by the (i) loss of net sales as a result of the Wine and Spirits Divestitures and (ii) declines in Beer and organic Wine and Spirits segments net sales.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

The net gain (loss) is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. At settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing the results of our operating segments to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.\nStrategic business reconfiguration costs\nWe recognized costs primarily in connection with losses on write-downs of excess inventory resulting from our initiatives to streamline, increase efficiencies, and reduce our cost structure primarily within our Wine and Spirits segment (Second Quarter 2026, Six Months 2026).\nFlow through of inventory step-up\nIn connection with acquisitions, the allocation of purchase price in excess of book value for certain inventories on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up. Inventory step-up represents an assumed manufacturing profit attributable to the acquired business prior to acquisition.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nGain (loss) on sale of business\nWe recognized a net loss from the sales of businesses largely in connection with the 2025 Wine Divestitures (Second Quarter 2026, Six Months 2026).\nTransition services agreements activity\nWe recognized costs in connection with transition services agreements related to the previous sales of portions of our wine and spirits business.\n2025 Restructuring Initiative\nWe recognized costs in connection with an enterprise-wide cost savings and restructuring initiative designed to help optimize the performance of our business (Second Quarter 2026, Six Months 2026).\nStrategic business reconfiguration costs\nWe recognized costs in connection with certain activities which are intended to streamline, increase efficiencies, and reduce our cost structure.\nOther gains (losses)\nWe recognized other gains (losses) primarily from (i) a net gain from the sale of assets (Second Quarter 2026, Six Months 2026) and (ii) a net loss on foreign currency as a result of the resolution of various tax examinations and assessments (Second Quarter 2025, Six Months 2025).\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

The decrease in organic net sales is largely driven by (i) $12.3 million of unfavorable product mix, (ii) a $12.1 million decrease in branded wine and spirits shipment volume, and (iii) an $8.7 million decrease in contractual distributor payments as compared to Second Quarter 2025. The decrease in unfavorable product mix and branded wine and spirits shipment volume are both attributable to our U.S. wholesale and international markets driven by the continued change in cadence of shipments to better align with ongoing weaker consumer demand. Additionally, we believe our branded wine and spirits shipment volume was negatively impacted by both tariffs imposed by the U.S. government and by retaliatory tariffs and actions in certain international markets.\nGross profit\nSecond\nQuarter\n2026\nSecond\nQuarter\n2025\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\n(in millions)\nBeer\n$\n1,240.0 \n$\n1,366.4 \n$\n(126.4)\n(9\n%)\nWine and Spirits\n54.8 \n164.0 \n(109.2)\n(67\n%)\nComparable Adjustments\n15.2 \n(18.6)\n33.8 \nNM\nConsolidated gross profit\n$\n1,310.0 \n$\n1,511.8 \n$\n(201.8)\n(13\n%)\nThe decrease in Beer gross profit is largely due to (i) a $118.3 million decline in shipment volume and (ii) $42.9 million of increased cost of product sold, partially offset by the $35.8 million favorable impact from pricing. The increase in cost of product sold is primarily due to (i) $22.6 million in tariffs on aluminum cans, (ii) $10.0 million of unfavorable fixed cost absorption related to decreased production levels as compared to Second Quarter 2025, (iii) $8.0 million of increased transportation costs, and (iv) $6.7 million of higher depreciation resulting from the Mexico Beer Projects. To partially offset the increase in cost of product sold we are executing efficiency and cost optimization initiatives focused largely on procurement and logistics that resulted in nearly $65 million of net benefit for Second Quarter 2026.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. Q2 FY 2026 Form 10-Q\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR    I    38\nMD&A\nTable of Contents\nThe decrease in Wine and Spirits gross profit is due to $83.4 million from the Wine and Spirits Divestitures that is no longer part of our business and a $25.8 million decrease in organic gross profit.

Our ability to consistently generate robust cash flow from our operations is one of our most significant financial strengths. It enables us to invest in our people and our brands, make capital investments and strategic acquisitions, provide a cash dividend program, and repurchase shares of our common stock. Our largest use of cash in our operations is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. Historically, we have used this cash flow to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. Additionally, our commercial paper program is used to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets. We use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures, among other things.\nWe seek to maintain adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and planned capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.\nWe have an agreement with a financial institution for payment services and to facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program through this participating financial institution. The program is available to certain of our suppliers allowing them the option to manage their cash flow. We are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institution and the suppliers in connection with the program.

This decrease consisted of:\nDebt repayment\nDebt issuance\nBank facilities\nIn May 2025, we entered into the 2025 Term Credit Agreement, which provides for a six-month delayed draw $500.0 million term loan facility, available in up to two draws. The balance is due and payable two years after the initial funding date, if any, occurs. There are no borrowings outstanding under the 2025 Term Credit Agreement.\nIn April 2025, we entered into the 2025 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated our then-existing senior credit facility. The 2025 Restatement Agreement resulted in (i) refinancing the existing $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, (ii) extending its maturity to April 28, 2030, and (iii) refining certain negative covenants. There are no borrowings outstanding under the 2025 Credit Agreement.\nSenior notes\nOn July 2, 2025, we repaid the 4.75% December 2015 Senior Notes using proceeds from the 2025 Wine Divestitures and cash on hand. On June 12, 2025, we repaid the 5.00% February 2023 Senior Notes using proceeds from the 2025 \nConstellation Brands, Inc.

Each of these notes were redeemed prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nIn May 2025, we issued the 4.80% May 2025 Senior Notes. Proceeds from this offering, net of discount and debt issuance costs, of $496.0 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of commercial paper and other indebtedness, working capital, funding capital expenditures, and other business opportunities.\nGeneral\nThe majority of our outstanding borrowings as of August 31, 2025, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2025 to calendar 2050.\nAdditionally, we have a commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.25 billion of commercial paper. Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2025 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility.\nWe do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. If the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when commercial paper borrowings mature, we expect to utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2025 Credit Agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings. We do not expect that fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility.\nWe had the following remaining borrowing capacity available under our 2025 Credit Agreement:\nAugust 31,\n2025\nSeptember 30,\n2025\n(in millions)\nRevolving credit facility \n(1)\n$\n1,986.0 \n$\n2,144.2 \n(1)\nNet of outstanding revolving credit facility borrowings and outstanding letters of credit under our 2025 Credit Agreement and outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program (excluding unamortized discount) of $252.7 million and $94.5 million as of August 31, 2025, and September 30, 2025, respectively.\nThe financial institutions participating in our 2025 Credit Agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe they will comply with any future funding requests. However, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.\nAs of August 31, 2025, we and our subsidiaries were subject to covenants that are contained in our 2025 Credit Agreement and the 2025 Term Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional subsidiary indebtedness, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio, both as defined in our 2025 Credit Agreement. As of August 31, 2025, under our 2025 Credit Agreement, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net leverage ratio was 4.0x.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default set forth in our 2025 Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to those set forth in our 2025 Credit Agreement.\nOur indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to: (i) a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii) a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions, and (iii) restrictions on mergers, consolidations, and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

Shares may be repurchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions. We may fund future share repurchases with cash generated from operations, proceeds from borrowings, and/or divestiture proceeds. Any repurchased shares will become treasury shares, including shares previously repurchased under the 2025 Authorization.\nWe currently expect to return $4.0 billion in share repurchases to stockholders from Fiscal 2026 through Fiscal 2028, but such repurchases are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our 2025 Annual Report.\nFor additional information, refer to Note 17 of our consolidated financial statements included in our 2025 Annual Report and Note 13.\nAccounting Guidance\nAccounting guidance adopted for Six Months 2026 did not have a material impact on our Financial Statements.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.
