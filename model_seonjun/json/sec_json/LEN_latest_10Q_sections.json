While our deliveries were just below our goal and we sold more homes than expected during the quarter, it was at the expense of margin deterioration. Sales volume was difficult to maintain and required additional incentives in order to achieve our expected pace and avoid a buildup of excess inventory. Accordingly, we remained focused on volume and even flow production, although at a slightly slower pace. We will maintain responsible volume to maintain an affordable cost structure and relieve pressure on sales and deliveries which will establish a floor on margin as the overall housing market continues to remain short on supply. \nThe macroeconomic landscape remains challenging, and diminished consumer confidence is being affected by a wide range of uncertainties, both domestic and global. We have begun to see interest rates drift downwards and we’re just beginning to see consumers return to the market. Against that backdrop, supply remains constrained in most markets driven by years of underproduction. New construction has slowed as builders have pulled back on production due to slow sales and affordability concerns therefore exacerbating the chronic supply shortage. Demand is still high as people want and need homes, but affordability and waning confidence around buying now have been constraining that demand. We are optimistic that if mortgage rates approach the 6% level, or even lower, we will soon see some firming in the market, and we will benefit from stronger affordability and therefore demand. \nOperationally, we will continue to drive growth, production and volume to fill the housing shortage that we know persists across our markets. We remain focused on leveraging advanced technology throughout our homebuilding operations. We look to position ourselves as the leading technology-enabled, low-cost homebuilding manufacturer. We are now situated with a lower cost structure, efficient product offerings, and strong market positions to accommodate pent-up demand as rates moderate and confidence ultimately returns. Financially, we are focused on driving an efficient, land-light balance sheet to effectively have land banks and third parties hold and develop our land assets while we build cash flow. \nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2025, we anticipate selling between 20,000 to 21,000 homes and delivering between 22,000 and 23,000 homes. Our average sales price is expected to be between $380,000 and $390,000, as we continue to see pricing pressure on homes sold during the quarter. We are focused on driving sales and closings and maintaining strong current cash flow even at reduced profitability. We expect our margin to come in at approximately 17.5%, depending on market conditions. \nWhile the short-term road ahead may seem choppy, we are optimistic about our future. We are well-prepared with a strong national footprint, increasing community count, and growing volume. Our strong balance sheet and land banking relationships, along with our technology-enabled solutions, will afford us flexibility and advantaged opportunities for strategic growth. \n(1) Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in quarterly results. Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Our homebuilding business is seasonal in nature and generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second and third fiscal quarters and increased deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year. However, a variety of factors can alter seasonal patterns.\nOur net earnings attributable to Lennar were $591.0 million, or $2.29 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to our third quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2024 of $1.2 billion, or $4.26 per diluted share. Excluding mark-to-market gains of $99.2 million on technology investments, third quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2025 were $516.0 million, or $2.00 per diluted share. Excluding mark-to-market gains of $39.1 million on technology investments and one-time items of $89.0 million in our Multifamily segment, third quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2024 were $1.1 billion or $3.90 per diluted share.\n31\nFinancial information relating to our operations was as follows:\nThree Months Ended August 31, 2025\n(In thousands)\nHomebuilding\nFinancial

Prior year information includes only stand-alone data for Lennar Corporation for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2024.\nThree Months Ended August 31, 2025 versus Three Months Ended August 31, 2024 \nRevenues from home sales decreased 9% in the third quarter of 2025 to $8.2 billion from $9.0 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Revenues were lower primarily due to a 9% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries were 21,584 homes in the third quarter of 2025, compared to 21,516 homes in the third quarter of 2024. The average sales price of homes delivered was $383,000 in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $422,000 in the third quarter of 2024. \n33\nThe decrease in average sales price of homes delivered in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to continued weakness in the market.\nGross margins on home sales were $1.4 billion, or 17.5%, in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $2.0 billion, or 22.5%, in the third quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2025, gross margins decreased primarily due to a lower revenue per square foot and higher land costs year over year, which were partially offset by a decrease in construction costs, reflecting our continued focus on cost-saving initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $676.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $600.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 8.2% in the third quarter of 2025, from 6.7% in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to less leverage as a result of lower revenues and an increase in marketing and selling expenses. \nDuring the three months ended August 31, 2025, our homebuilding operating earnings included $8.7 million of interest income, compared to $33.8 million of interest income in the three months ended August 31, 2024. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower cash balances year over year.\nOperating earnings for the Financial Services segment were $177.4 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $143.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to higher profit per locked loan in the mortgage business as a result of higher margins.\nOperating loss for the Multifamily segment was $16.4 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to operating earnings of $79.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, which were positively impacted by a $179.0 million one-time net gain from the sale of assets in our LMV Fund I, partially offset by a one-time $90.0 million write-down of non-core assets. \nOperating earnings for the Lennar Other segment were $62.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to operating earnings of $20.1 million in the third quarter of 2024. The Lennar Other operating earnings for both the third quarter of 2025 and 2024 were primarily related to $99.2 million and $39.1 million mark-to-market gains on our technology investments, respectively.\nIn the third quarter of 2025 and 2024, we had tax provisions of $190.9 million and $347.9 million, which resulted in an overall effective income tax rate of 24.4% and 23.0%, respectively. For both periods, our effective income tax rate included state income tax expense and non-deductible executive compensation, partially offset by tax credits. The increase in our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a decrease in tax credits. On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the \"Act\") was enacted, introducing various changes to U.S. federal tax law. We do not expect the Act to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2025 and are currently evaluating the potential impact of the Act on our future periods. \nNine Months Ended August 31, 2025 versus Nine Months Ended August 31, 2024 \nRevenues from home sales were $23.2 billion and $24.3 billion in the nine months ended August 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Revenues decreased primarily due to a 7% decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered, partially offset by a 3% increase in the number of homes delivered. New home deliveries increased to 59,549 homes in the nine months ended August 31, 2025 from 58,004 homes in the nine months ended August 31, 2024. The average sales price of homes delivered was $393,000 in the nine months ended August 31, 2025, compared to $421,000 in the nine months ended August 31, 2024. The decrease in average sales price of homes delivered in the nine months ended August 31, 2025 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to continued weakness in the market.\nGross margins on home sales were $4.2 billion, or 18.0%, in the nine months ended August 31, 2025, compared to $5.4 billion, or 22.3%, in the nine months ended August 31, 2024. During the nine months ended August 31, 2025, gross margins decreased primarily due to lower revenue per square foot and higher land costs year over year, which were partially offset by a decrease in construction costs, reflecting our continued focus on cost-saving initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $2.0 billion in the nine months ended August 31, 2025, compared to $1.8 billion in the nine months ended August 31, 2024. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and \n34\nadministrative expenses increased to 8.5% in the nine months ended August 31, 2025, from 7.4% in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, primarily due to less leverage as a result of lower revenues and an increase in marketing and selling expenses. \nDuring the nine months ended August 31, 2025, our homebuilding operating earnings included $45.7 million of interest income, compared to $134.6 million of interest income in the nine months ended August 31, 2024. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower cash balances year over year.\nOperating earnings for the Financial Services segment were $476.9 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2025, compared to $420.5 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2024. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to higher profit per locked loan in the mortgage business as a result of higher margins.\nOperating loss for the Multifamily segment was $30.9 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2025, compared to operating earnings of $43.1 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2024, which was positively impacted by a $179.0 million one-time net gain from the sale of assets in our LMV Fund I, partially offset by a one-time $90.0 million write-down of non-core assets. \nOperating loss for the Lennar Other segment was $79.7 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2025, compared to operating loss of $47.3 million in the nine months ended August 31, 2024. The Lennar Other operating loss for nine months ended August 31, 2025 was primarily due to losses from certain strategic investments, partially offset by mark-to-market gains on our technology investments. The Lennar Other operating loss for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 was primarily related to operating losses from certain strategic investments, which was partially offset by $12.5 million of mark-to-market gains on our technology investments and a $46.5 million one-time gain on the sale of a technology investment.\nFor the nine months ended August 31, 2025 and 2024, we had tax provisions of $520.5 million and $859.2 million, respectively, which resulted in overall effective income tax rates of 24.7% and 23.2%, respectively. For both periods, our effective income tax rate included state income tax expense and non-deductible executive compensation, partially offset by tax credits. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended August 31, 2025 from the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in tax credits and a decrease in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.\n35\nHomebuilding Segments\nAt August 31, 2025, our reportable Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other are outlined in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

During the nine months ended August 31, 2025, two additional LMV I rental operation projects were sold to third-party buyers.\n40\nLennar Other Segment\nOur Lennar Other segment includes fund investments we retained subsequent to our sale of the Rialto investment and asset management platform, as well as strategic investments in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industries to better serve homebuyers and homeowners and increase efficiencies. At August 31, 2025 and November 30, 2024, we had $844.6 million and $894.9 million, respectively, of assets in our Lennar Other segment, which included investments in unconsolidated entities of $372.3 million and $379.4 million, respectively. We have/had investments in Blend Labs, Inc. (“Blend Labs”), Hippo Holdings, Inc. (“Hippo”), Opendoor Technologies, Inc.(“Opendoor”), SmartRent, Inc. (“SmartRent”), Sonder Holdings, Inc. (“Sonder”) and Sunnova Energy International, Inc. (“Sunnova”), which are held at market and the carrying value of which will therefore change depending on the value of our shareholdings in those entities on the last day of each quarter. All of the investments are accounted for as investments in equity securities which are held at fair value and the changes in fair values are recognized through earnings. Details of these investments are included within Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a detail of Lennar Other realized and unrealized gains from sales of shares and mark-to-market adjustments on our publicly traded technology investments:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\n(In thousands)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nBlend Labs (BLND)\n$\n— \n2,270 \n(3,737)\n5,921 \nHippo (HIPO)\n27,754 \n6,609 \n(598)\n33,795 \nOpendoor (OPEN)\n71,345 \n(564)\n39,638 \n(16,156)\nSmartRent (SMRT)\n— \n(5,634)\n(4,483)\n(12,206)\nSonder (SOND)\n— \n71 \n(19)\n82 \nSunnova (NOVA)\n124 \n36,371 \n(23,521)\n1,036 \nLennar Other realized and unrealized gains from technology investments (1)\n$\n99,223 \n39,123 \n7,280 \n12,472 \n(1)\nDuring the nine months ended August 31, 2025, we generated $44.7 million of cash and realized a loss of $25.9 million on the sale of our shares in Blend Labs, Hippo, SmartRent, Sonder and Sunnova.\n(2) Financial Condition and Capital Resources\nAt August 31, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash related to our homebuilding, financial services, multifamily and other operations of $1.8 billion, compared to $5.0 billion at November 30, 2024 and $4.3 billion at August 31, 2024.\nWe finance all of our activities, including homebuilding, financial services, multifamily, other and general operating needs, primarily with cash generated from our operations, debt issuances and cash borrowed under our warehouse lines of credit and our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). At August 31, 2025, we had $1.4 billion of homebuilding cash and cash equivalents and ended the third quarter of 2025 with total liquidity of $5.1 billion.\nOperating Cash Flow Activities\nDuring the nine months ended August 31, 2025 and 2024, cash (used in) provided by operating activities totaled ($1.5) billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. During the nine months ended August 31, 2025, cash used in operating activities was impacted by (1) an increase in inventories due to land purchases and construction costs of $1.3 billion; (2) an increase in deposits and pre-acquisition costs on real estate of $1.2 billion as we increased the percentage of controlled homesites primarily as a result of option contracts with Millrose; (3) an increase in other assets of $210 million; and (4) a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of $978 million. This was partially offset by our net earnings and a decrease in loans held-for-sale of $240 million primarily related to the sale of loans originated by our Financial Services segment.\nDuring the nine months ended August 31, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was impacted primarily by our net earnings, a decrease in loans held-for-sale of $245 million primarily related to the sale of loans originated by our Financial Services segment. This was offset by (1) an increase in inventories due to strategic land purchases, land development and construction costs of $708 million; (2) an increase in deposits and pre-acquisition costs on real estate of $985 million as we increased the percentage of controlled homesites; and (3) a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities of $176 million.\nInvesting Cash Flow Activities\nDuring the nine months ended August 31, 2025 and 2024, cash provided by (used in) investing activities totaled $176 million and ($177) million, respectively. During the nine months ended August 31, 2025, our cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to (1) $233 million received from the sale of an investment in a joint venture, $87 million proceeds from the sale of investments and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities of $236 million, which primarily included \n41\n(1) $86 million from Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) $129 million from Multifamily entities and (3) $21 million from our Lennar Other unconsolidated entities and $115 million proceeds from the sale of notes receivables. This was partially offset by the $254 million acquisition of Rausch, net of cash acquired. In addition, we had cash contributions of $203 million to unconsolidated entities, which included (1) $169 million to Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) $10 million to Lennar other unconsolidated entities and (3) $24 million to Multifamily unconsolidated entities and $103 million of net additions of operating properties and equipment.\nDuring the nine months ended August 31, 2024, our cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash contributions of $312 million to unconsolidated entities, which included (1) $164 million to Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) $131 million to Lennar Other unconsolidated entities, and (3) $17 million to Multifamily unconsolidated entities and $130 million of net additions of operating properties and equipment. This was partially offset by distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities of $237 million, which primarily included (1) $53 million from Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, (2) $18 million from our Lennar Other unconsolidated entities, and (3) $166 million from Multifamily entities.\nFinancing Cash Flow Activities\nDuring the nine months ended August 31, 2025 and 2024, cash used in financing activities totaled $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. During the nine months ended August 31, 2025, cash used in financing activities was primarily due to (1) $1.8 billion of repurchases of our common stock, which included $1.7 billion of repurchases under our repurchase program and $66 million of repurchases related to our equity compensation plan; (2) $394 million of dividend payments; (3) $479 million of net payments from liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned due to activity with land banks; (4) $416 million net cash in connection with the Millrose spin-off; (5) redemption of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% senior notes due May 2025; and (6) $67 million of net repayments under our Financial Services' warehouse facilities. The cash used in financing activities was partially offset by the receipt of proceeds of the sale of $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.20% senior notes due 2030 and $1.1 billion of net borrowings under our unsecured revolving Credit Facility.\nDuring the nine months ended August 31, 2024, cash used in financing activities was primarily due to (1) $1.7 billion of repurchases of our common stock, which included $1.6 billion of repurchases under our repurchase program and $86 million of repurchases related to our equity compensation plan; (2) $414 million of dividend payments; (3) $618 million of net repayments under our Financial Services' warehouse facilities; (4) redemption of $454 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% senior notes due April 2024; (5) $100 million of partial repurchase of our 4.75% senior notes due 2027; and (6) $125 million of net payments from liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned due to activity with land banks.\nDebt to total capital ratios are financial measures commonly used in the homebuilding industry and are presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our homebuilding operations. Homebuilding debt to total capital and net Homebuilding debt to total capital are calculated as follows:\nAt\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAugust 31, 2025\nNovember 30, 2024\nAugust 31, 2024\nHomebuilding debt\n$\n3,523,766 \n2,258,283 \n2,263,256 \nStockholders’ equity\n22,570,320 \n27,870,135 \n27,412,520 \nTotal capital\n$\n26,094,086 \n30,128,418 \n29,675,776 \nHomebuilding debt to total capital\n13.5 \n%\n7.5 \n%\n7.6 \n%\nHomebuilding debt\n$\n3,523,766 \n2,258,283 \n2,263,256 \nLess: Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents\n1,406,215 \n4,662,643 \n4,037,405 \nNet Homebuilding debt\n$\n2,117,551 \n(2,404,360)\n(1,774,149)\nNet Homebuilding debt to total capital (1)\n8.6 \n%\n(9.4)\n%\n(6.9)\n%\n(1)\nNet homebuilding debt to total capital is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net homebuilding debt (homebuilding debt less homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net homebuilding debt plus stockholders' equity). We believe the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in homebuilding operations. However, because net homebuilding debt to total capital is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement our GAAP results.\nAt August 31, 2025, Homebuilding debt to total capital was higher compared to November 30, 2024 and August 31, 2024, primarily as a result of a decrease in stockholders' equity due to the spin-off of Millrose and share repurchases, an increase in Homebuilding debt due to issuance of senior notes and outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility, and net earnings.\n42\nWe are continually exploring various types of transactions to manage our leverage and liquidity positions, take advantage of market opportunities and increase our revenues and earnings. These transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness, the repurchase of our outstanding indebtedness, the repurchase of our common stock, the acquisition of homebuilders and other companies, the purchase or sale of assets or lines of business, the issuance of common stock, strategic transactions to accelerate our land light strategy or securities convertible into shares of common stock, and/or the pursuit of other financing alternatives. In connection with some of our non-homebuilding businesses, we are also considering other types of transactions such as sales, restructurings, and joint ventures as we continue to move towards being a pure play homebuilding company. \nOn February 7, 2025, we successfully completed the taxable spin-off of Millrose from Lennar through a distribution of approximately 80% of Millrose's stock to our stockholders. We temporarily retain, but do not vote, the remaining 20% of the total outstanding shares of Millrose common stock, which we expect to dispose of through a split-off, a stock sale or another transaction. In connection with the spin-off, we contributed to Millrose $5.6 billion in land assets and cash of $1.0 billion, which included $584 million of cash deposits related to option contracts. The spin-off transaction accelerates our longstanding strategy of becoming a pure-play, asset-light, new home manufacturing company.\nOn February 10, 2025, we acquired Rausch, a residential homebuilder based in Fayetteville, Arkansas. We acquired Rausch’s homebuilding operations while Millrose acquired Rausch's land assets and we have options on the land. With this acquisition, we have expanded our footprint into new markets in Arkansas (Bentonville/Fayetteville, Little Rock and Jonesboro), Oklahoma (Tulsa and Stillwater), Alabama (Birmingham and Tuscaloosa), and Kansas/Missouri (Kansas City), while adding to our existing footprint in Texas (Houston and San Antonio), Oklahoma (Oklahoma City), Alabama (Huntsville) and Florida (Gulf Coast).\nOur Homebuilding senior notes and other debt payable as well as letters of credit and surety bonds are summarized within Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Homebuilding average debt outstanding and the average rates of interest was as follows:\nNine Months Ended August 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2025\n2024\nHomebuilding average debt outstanding\n$\n2,929,259 \n2,512,139 \nAverage interest rate\n5.0%\n4.8%\nInterest incurred\n$\n128,203 \n100,056 \nIn May 2025, we issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.20% senior notes due 2030 (the \"5.20% senior notes\") at a price of 99.969% of the principal amount. Proceeds from the offering, after payment of expenses, totaled $695.6 million. The 5.20% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated, but are guaranteed by substantially all of our 100% owned homebuilding subsidiaries. Interest on the 5.20% Senior Notes is due semi-annually beginning January 30, 2026. \nWe utilized the net proceeds from the sale of the 5.20% senior notes primarily to pay off $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% senior notes due May 2025. The redemption price, which was paid in cash, was 100% of the principal amount outstanding.\nIn May 2025, we entered into a new unsecured delayed draw term loan facility with an initial committed borrowing availability of approximately $1.6 billion (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility”), which can be increased by an additional $500 million via an accordion feature. In July 2025, the total commitment under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility was increased by $100 million, thereby increasing the borrowing available capacity to $1.7 billion. The credit agreement governing our new unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility permits us to draw up to six times in the first 180 days after the effective date of the credit agreement. Once drawn, we may at any time prepay the loan, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The term loan’s maturity date is three years from the initial effectiveness date of the credit agreement or May 2028, and at our discretion, it can be extended for an additional year until May 2029, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, interest rates are equal to the adjusted term SOFR determined for the interest period plus the \n43\napplicable margin. As of August 31, 2025, there were no borrowings under the credit agreement governing the new unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility.\nThe maximum available borrowings on our Credit Facility were as follows:\n(In thousands)\nAt August 31, 2025\nCommitments - maturing in May 2027\n$\n225,000 \nCommitments - maturing in November 2029\n2,900,000 \nTotal commitments\n$\n3,125,000 \nAccordion feature\n375,000 \nTotal maximum borrowings capacity\n$\n3,500,000 \nThe proceeds available under the Credit Facility, which are subject to specified conditions for borrowing, may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. In the first quarter of 2025, we received an additional $150 million in commitments. In the third quarter of 2025, we secured an additional $100 million in commitments. The Credit Facility also provides that up to $477.5 million in commitments may be used for letters of credit. The maturity, debt covenants and details of the Credit Facility are unchanged from the disclosure in the Financial Condition and Capital Resources section in our 2024 Form 10-K. In addition to the Credit Facility, we have other letter of credit facilities with different financial institutions.\nUnder the agreements governing our Credit Facility and Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, we are required to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio and either a liquidity or an interest coverage ratio. \nThese ratios are calculated per the Credit Facility and Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility \nagreements\n, which involve adjustments to GAAP financial measures. We believe we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of August 31, 2025. The following summarizes our debt covenant requirements and our actual levels or ratios with respect to those covenants as calculated per the Credit Facility and Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility agreements as of August 31, 2025:\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCovenant Level\nLevel Achieved\nMinimum net worth test\n$\n10,000,000 \n16,675,053 \nMaximum leverage ratio\n60.0%\n14.2%\nLiquidity test\n1.00 \n50.00 \n44\nFinancial Services Warehouse Facilities\nOur Financial Services segment uses residential mortgage loan warehouse facilities to finance its residential lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to investors and the proceeds are collected. The facilities are non-recourse to us and are expected to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. The LMF Commercial warehouse facilities finance LMF Commercial loan origination and securitization activities and are secured by up to 80% interests in the originated commercial loans financed. These facilities and the related borrowings and collateral are detailed in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChanges in Capital Structure\nIn January 2024, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to our stock repurchase program to enable us to repurchase up to an additional $5 billion in value of our outstanding Class A or Class B common stock. Repurchases are authorized to be made in open-market or private transactions. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date. At August 31, 2025, we have a remaining authorization to repurchase $1.7 billion in value of our Class A or Class B common stock. The details of our Class A and Class B common stock repurchases under the authorized repurchase program for the nine months ended August 31, 2025 and August 31, 2024 are included in Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring the nine months ended August 31, 2025, treasury shares increased by 14.8 million shares primarily due to our repurchase of 14.1 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock through our stock repurchase program. During the nine months ended August 31, 2024, treasury shares increased by 11.2 million shares primarily due to our repurchase of $10.6 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock through our stock repurchase program.\nOn February 7, 2025, we distributed a stock dividend consisting of 120,980,401 shares of Millrose Class A common stock and 11,819,811 shares of Millrose Class B common stock (representing approximately 80% of the total outstanding shares of Millrose common stock) to the holders of Lennar Class A or Class B common stock as of the close of business on January 21, 2025, the record date of the Millrose spin-off.\nOn September 26, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share on both our Class A and Class B common stock, payable on October 27, 2025 to holders of record at the close of business on October 10, 2025. On July 18, 2025, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.50 per share for both our Class A and Class B common stock to holders of record at the close of business day July 3, 2025. We approved and paid cash dividends of $0.50 per share for each of the four quarters of 2024 for both our Class A and Class B common stock. \nBased on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long-term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity.\nSupplemental Financial Information\nOur outstanding senior notes are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, which are primarily homebuilding subsidiaries. These guarantees are full and unconditional. The guarantors of our senior notes are currently those subsidiaries that also guarantee Lennar Corporation's letter of credit facilities, its Credit Facility and Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, which are disclosed in Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the indentures governing our senior notes, guarantees may be suspended or released under certain circumstances.\nSupplemental information for the Obligors, which excludes non-guarantor subsidiaries and intercompany transactions, at August 31, 2025 is included in the following tables. Intercompany balances and transactions within the Obligors have been eliminated and amounts attributable to the Obligors' investment in consolidated subsidiaries that have not issued or guaranteed the senior notes have been excluded. Amounts due from and transactions with nonobligor subsidiaries and related parties are separately disclosed:\n(In thousands)\nAt August 31, 2025\nAt November 30, 2024\nDue from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n14,201,862 \n18,396,060 \nEquity method investments\n2,316,865 \n1,078,635 \nTotal assets\n40,461,039 \n50,251,091 \nTotal liabilities\n9,008,390 \n10,067,424 \nNine Months Ended\n(In thousands)\nAugust 31, 2025\nTotal revenues\n$\n22,131,952 \nOperating earnings\n2,245,294 \nEarnings before income taxes\n1,720,963 \nNet earnings attributable to Lennar\n1,295,435 \n45\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe regularly monitor the results of our Homebuilding, Multifamily and Lennar Other unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. We also monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investments. We believe that substantially all of the joint ventures were in compliance with applicable debt covenants at August 31, 2025. \nHomebuilding: Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nAs of August 31, 2025, we had equity investments in 53 active Homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities (of which 4 had recourse debt, 15 had non-recourse debt and 34 had no debt) compared to 51 active Homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2024. Historically, we have invested in unconsolidated entities that acquired and developed land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third-party homebuyers. Through these entities, we have primarily sought to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while obtaining access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures. The use of these entities also, in some instances, has enabled us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Participants in these joint ventures have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners’ capital. Joint ventures with strategic partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise (e.g. commercial or infill experience) of our partners. Each joint venture is governed by an executive committee consisting of members from each partner. Details regarding these investments, balances and debt are included in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table summarizes the principal maturities of our Homebuilding unconsolidated entities (“JVs”) debt as per current debt arrangements as of August 31, 2025. It does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances. Many JV loans have extension options in the loan agreements that would allow the loans to be extended into future years.\nPrincipal Maturities of Unconsolidated JVs by Period\n(In thousands)\nTotal JV Debt\n2025\n2026\n2027\nThereafter\nOther\nBank debt without recourse to Lennar\n$\n1,444,787 \n217,262 \n151,462 \n403,654 \n672,409 \n— \nMaximum recourse debt exposure to Lennar\n31,423 \n— \n9,513 \n— \n21,910 \n— \nDebt issuance costs\n(5,320)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n(5,320)\nTotal\n$\n1,470,890 \n217,262 \n160,975 \n403,654 \n694,319 \n(5,320)\nWe own an approximately 40% interest in FivePoint Holdings, LLC., a NYSE listed company, and companies it manages, which own three large multi-use properties in California.\nWe temporarily hold an approximately 20% investment in the total outstanding shares of Millrose common stock, which we expect to dispose of through a split-off, a stock sale or another transaction.\nMultifamily: Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nAt August 31, 2025, Multifamily had equity investments in 25 active unconsolidated entities that are engaged in multifamily residential developments (of which 18 had non-recourse debt and 7 had no debt) compared to 23 active unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2024. We invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land to construct multifamily rental properties. Through these entities, we are focusing on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets. Initially, we participated in building multifamily developments and selling them soon after they were completed. Participants in these joint ventures have been financial partners. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our development and construction expertise with access to our partners’ capital. Each joint venture is governed by an operating agreement that provides significant substantive participating voting rights on major decisions to our partners.\nThe Multifamily segment includes LMV I, LMV II, the CPPIB Fund and the Institutional JV, which are long-term multifamily development investment vehicles involved in the development and construction of class-A multifamily assets. Details of each fund as of and during the nine months ended August 31, 2025 are included in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n46\nThe following table summarizes the principal maturities of our Multifamily unconsolidated entities debt as per current debt arrangements as of August 31, 2025. It does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances.\nPrincipal Maturities of Unconsolidated JVs by Period\n(In thousands)\nTotal JV Debt\n2025\n2026\n2027\nThereafter\nOther\nDebt without recourse to Lennar\n$\n2,503,442 \n112,260 \n1,140,644 \n879,090 \n371,448 \n— \nDebt issuance costs\n(23,595)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n(23,595)\nTotal\n$\n2,479,847 \n112,260 \n1,140,644 \n879,090 \n371,448 \n(23,595)\nLennar Other: Investments in Unconsolidated Entities\nAs part of the sale of the Rialto investment and asset management platform, we retained the right to receive a portion of payments with regard to carried interests if certain funds meet specified performance thresholds. We periodically receive advance distributions related to the carried interests in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from allocations of taxable income to the carried interests. These distributions are not subject to clawbacks but reduce future carried interest payments to which we become entitled from the applicable funds and are recorded as equity in earnings (losses) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. Our investment in the Rialto funds totaled $134.3 million and $140.1 million as of August 31, 2025 and November 30, 2024, respectively. \nAs of August 31, 2025 and November 30, 2024, we had strategic technology investments in unconsolidated entities of $238.0 million and $239.3 million, respectively, accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our strategic technology investments through our LEN\nX \nbusiness help to enhance the homebuying and homeownership experience, and are an important part of our focus on using technology to reduce costs. Details regarding these investments are included in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOption Contracts\nWe often obtain access to land through option contracts, which generally enable us to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land banks) and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise the options. Since fiscal year 2020, we have been increasing the percentage of our total homesites that we control through option contracts rather than own.\nThe table below indicates the number of homesites to which we had access through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated JVs (i.e., controlled homesites) and homesites owned (excluding homes in inventory):\nYears of\nAugust 31, 2025\nControlled Homesites\nOwned Homesites\nTotal Homesites\nSupply Owned (1)\nEast\n111,916 \n913 \n112,829 \nCentral\n135,050 \n3,789 \n138,839 \nSouth Central\n164,849 \n1,919 \n166,768 \nWest\n95,300 \n3,133 \n98,433 \nOther\n4,649 \n1,561 \n6,210 \nTotal homesites\n511,764 \n11,315 \n523,079 \n0.1 \n% of total homesites\n98%\n2%\nYears of\nAugust 31, 2024\nControlled Homesites\nOwned Homesites\nTotal Homesites\nSupply Owned (1)\nEast \n90,402 \n16,172 \n106,574 \nCentral\n89,462 \n30,788 \n120,250 \nSouth Central\n107,395 \n16,645 \n124,040 \nWest\n77,239 \n21,152 \n98,391 \nOther\n4,828 \n1,891 \n6,719 \nTotal homesites\n369,326 \n86,648 \n455,974 \n1.1 \n% of total homesites\n81%\n19%\n(1)\nBased on trailing twelve months of homes delivered.\nDetails on option contracts, transactions with land banks and Millrose and related consolidated inventory not owned and exposure are included in Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n47\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nOur contractual obligations and commercial commitments have not changed materially from those reported in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2024 Form 10-K, except for a decrease of $1.0 billion in land purchase contract obligations and an increase of $1.3 billion in Homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable, net.\n(3) Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.\n(4) Critical Accounting Policies\nThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended August 31, 2025 as compared to those we disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2024 Form 10-K."
