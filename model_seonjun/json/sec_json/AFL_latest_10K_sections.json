Business\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOVERVIEW\nAflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) was incorporated in 1973 under the laws of the state of Georgia. The Parent Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) provide financial protection to millions of policyholders and customers in Japan and the United States (U.S.). The Company’s principal business is supplemental health and life insurance products with the goal to provide customers the best value in supplemental insurance products in Japan and the U.S.  When a policyholder or insured gets sick or hurt, the Company pays cash benefits fairly and promptly for eligible claims. Throughout its 69-year history, the Company’s supplemental insurance policies have given policyholders the opportunity to focus on recovery, not financial stress.  \nThe Company has continued to develop and expand its product offerings over time. In Japan, the Company is cultivating an innovation-driven culture to meet the rapidly changing customer and societal needs. In the U.S., the Company continues to make broad-based investments in digital enhancements and innovation within the U.S. platform. In recent years, the Company invested in distribution opportunities through acquisitions and partnerships and pivoted to digital sales methods. For information on the reporting segments see the Result of Operations by Segment section of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A).\nThe Company is authorized to conduct insurance business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, several U.S. territories, and Japan. The Company’s website is: www.aflac.com. Information included on the Company’s website is not incorporated by reference into this filing. The Company makes available free of charge through its website, its annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nREVENUE-GENERATING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company's strategy for growth in the U.S. and Japan has remained straightforward and consistent for many years. The Company develops relevant supplemental health insurance products offering financial protection from the rising out-of-pocket expenses associated with medical events that are not covered by the insureds' primary coverage. The Company also offers a complement of other voluntary health and life insurance products to fit the needs of its customers. Additionally, the Company aims to obtain more customers by selling where the customer prefers to purchase protection, whether through an agent or broker, a distribution partner or directly from the Company. To help promote its insurance products, the Company’s marketing campaigns feature the Aflac Duck.\nLONG-TERM GROWTH STRATEGY\n2\nItem 1. Business\nIn 1999, the Company had been running commercials for nearly a decade, but its brand awareness was hovering at about 10%. An innovative marketing campaign with something unique and memorable that would build brand awareness was needed. The Aflac Duck’s first commercial in the U.S., “Park Bench,” aired on January 1, 2000 and taught consumers how to pronounce “Aflac.” The Aflac Duck made its international debut in Japan in 2003. In the time since its U.S. debut, the Aflac Duck has become one of the most familiar advertising icons in the world, appearing in many commercials and countless print ads in both the U.S. and Japan. Today, the Aflac Duck is a helpmate who increases brand knowledge and connection.  \nThe Company's insurance business consists of two reporting segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S.  The primary insurance subsidiary in the Aflac Japan segment is Aflac Life Insurance Japan Ltd. (ALIJ). Aflac U.S. includes the insurance subsidiaries American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac); Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC), branded as Aflac Group Insurance (AGI); American Family Life Assurance Company of New York (Aflac New York); Tier One Insurance Company (TOIC); and Aflac Benefits Solutions, Inc. (ABS), which provides a platform for Aflac Dental and Vision in the U.S.\nFor information on the Company's results of operations and financial information by segment, see Item 7. MD&A and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAFLAC JAPAN\nAflac Japan is the principal contributor to the Parent Company's consolidated earnings and the largest insurer in Japan in terms of cancer and medical (third sector insurance products) policies in force. For information on Aflac Japan's operating results, see the Aflac Japan Segment section of Item 7. MD&A.\nInsurance Products\nAflac Japan's third sector insurance products are supplemental products designed to help consumers pay for medical and nonmedical costs that are not reimbursed under Japan's national health insurance system. Changes in Japan's economy and an aging population have put increasing pressure on Japan's national health care system. As a result, more costs have been shifted to Japanese consumers, who in turn have become increasingly interested in insurance products that help them manage those costs. Aflac Japan has responded to this consumer need by enhancing existing products and developing new products. The focus at Aflac Japan remains on maintaining leadership in third sector insurance products that are less interest rate sensitive and have strong and stable margins. At the same time, Aflac Japan complements this core business with similarly profitable first sector products as outlined below. \nThird Sector Insurance Products\nCancer\nCancer Insurance\n \nAflac Japan pioneered the cancer insurance market in Japan in 1974, and remains the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan today. Aflac Japan's cancer insurance products provide a lump-sum benefit upon initial diagnosis of cancer and fixed daily benefits for subsequent hospitalization and outpatient treatments due to cancer, as well as cancer-related surgical and convalescent care benefits. In August 2022, Aflac Japan launched a new cancer insurance product, WINGS, which provides coverage for the latest cancer treatments and support for early detection. Additionally, in January 2023, Aflac Japan further strengthened its products and services by launching Aflac Yorisou Cancer Consultation Support, a new service that provides comprehensive support from the moment a policyholder suspects cancer through treatment and recovery.\nMedical and Other Health\nMedical Insurance\n  Aflac Japan's medical insurance products provide benefits for hospitalization, surgeries and outpatient treatment of various illnesses, as well as lump sum benefits related to three critical illnesses: cancer, heart attack, and stroke. In September 2023, Aflac Japan launched a new medical insurance product designed to appeal to younger policyholders with basic needs and existing policyholders who desire additional or updated coverage.\nOther\nNursing Care Insurance\n  Aflac Japan's Nursing Care Insurance provides coverage for out-of-pocket costs incurred when receiving public nursing care services.\n3\nItem 1. Business\nFirst Sector Insurance Products\nLife \nProtection-Type Life Insurance \nWhole Life\n  Aflac Japan launched Prepare Smart Whole-Life Insurance in 2018, a whole life insurance product with low cash surrender value, which offers non-smoking policyholders further discounted premiums, and it provides beneficiaries, typically a designated family member, with a pre-determined benefit payment upon the death of the insured.\nGIFT\n  GIFT is a term life insurance product that provides a designated family member with a fixed amount of money every month upon a breadwinner’s death or serious disability as family support.\nSavings-Type Life Insurance\nTsumitasu\n  Launched in June 2024, \nTsumitasu\n is an insurance product designed primarily for post-retirement preparation, with asset formation features and coverage for nursing care and other benefits.\nWAYS and Child Endowment\n  WAYS is an insurance product which has features that allow policyholders to convert a portion of their life insurance to medical, nursing care or fixed annuity benefits at a predetermined age. Aflac Japan's child endowment insurance product offers a death benefit until a child reaches age 18. This product also pays a lump-sum at the time of the child's entry into high school, as well as an educational annuity for each of the four years during his or her college education. \nDistribution Channels\nTraditional Sales Channel\n \nThis distribution channel includes individual agencies, independent corporate agencies and affiliated corporate agencies. Aflac Japan was represented by approximately 6,600 sales agencies at the end of 2024, with approximately 114,000 licensed sales associates employed by those agencies, including individual agencies.\nDai-ichi Life\n \nAflac Japan's alliance with Dai-ichi Life was launched in 2001, and approximately 37,000 Dai-ichi Life representatives offer Aflac's cancer products. Dai-ichi Life is included in Aflac Japan's affiliated corporate agencies distribution channel.\nJapan Post Group\n \nAflac Japan's alliance with Japan Post Group, which is included in Aflac Japan's affiliated corporate agencies distribution channel, was launched in 2008. After the alliance strengthened in 2013, the number of postal outlets of Japan Post Co. Ltd. (Japan Post Co.) selling Aflac Japan's cancer product increased to more than 20,000. Japan Post Insurance Co., Ltd. (Japan Post Insurance) offers Aflac Japan cancer products through its 76 directly managed offices responsible for corporate sales and 623 service departments in charge of individual sales.\nDaido Life\n \n \nIn 2013, Aflac Japan and Daido Life Insurance entered into an agreement for Daido to sell Aflac Japan's cancer insurance products specifically to the Hojinkai market, which is an association of small businesses. Currently, Daido also sells Aflac Japan's cancer insurance products to the market in the tax payment association, which is a not-for-profit association for small businesses to support tax related matters. Daido Life is included in Aflac Japan's affiliated corporate agencies distribution channel.\nBanks\n \nConsumers in Japan rely on banks to provide not only traditional bank services, but also as one key source to provide insurance solutions and other services. At December 31, 2024, Aflac Japan had agreements with approximately 90% of the total number of banks in Japan to sell its products.\n4\nItem 1. Business\nCompetitive Markets\nThe Company competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service, price, product design and sales efforts, as the number of insurance companies offering stand-alone cancer and medical insurance has more than doubled since the deregulation of the Japan market in 2001. However, based on Aflac Japan's size of annualized premiums in force and diversified distribution network, the Company believes it is well-positioned to continue to adapt to increased competition. Furthermore, the Company believes the continued development and maintenance of operating efficiencies will allow Aflac Japan to offer affordable products that appeal to consumers. The Company believes Aflac Japan will remain a leading provider of third sector products such as cancer and medical insurance coverage in Japan, principally due to its experience in the market, well-known brand, low-cost operations, expansive marketing system and product expertise.\nGovernment Regulation\nFinancial Services Agency (FSA)\n  The financial and business affairs of Aflac Japan are subject to examination by Japan's FSA. Aflac Japan files annual and interim reports and financial statements for the Japanese insurance operations based on a March 31 fiscal year end, prepared in accordance with Japanese regulatory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the FSA. Japanese regulatory basis earnings are determined using accounting principles that differ materially from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). For additional information, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nTwo FSA regulations applicable to Aflac Japan are outlined below.  \n▪\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity\nWith regard to personal information obtained from policyholders, the insured, or others, Aflac Japan is regulated in Japan by the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) and guidelines issued by FSA and other governmental authorities.\n•\nFSA Solvency Standard\nThe FSA maintains a solvency standard, the solvency margin ratio (SMR), which is used by Japanese regulators to monitor the financial strength of insurance companies. Aflac Japan's SMR is sensitive to interest rate, credit spread and foreign exchange rate changes. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 7. MD&A for additional information on SMR, including a discussion of measures the Company has taken to mitigate the sensitivity of Aflac Japan's SMR and the introduction of an economic value-based solvency regime based on the Insurance Capital Standards (ICS) for insurance companies effective for Aflac Japan's 2025 fiscal year.\nCompanies Act of Japan\n \nAflac Japan dividend distributions to the Parent Company are subject to permitted dividend capacity under the Companies Act of Japan. \nPolicyholder Protection\n \n \nThe Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. For additional information, see the Policyholder Protection section of Item 7. MD&A.\nFor additional information regarding Aflac Japan's operations and regulations, see the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of Item 7. MD&A and Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAFLAC U.S.\nThe Company designs its U.S. insurance products to provide supplemental coverage for people who already have major medical or primary insurance coverage, as Aflac U.S. insurance policies pay benefits regardless of other insurance. Aflac U.S. products are distributed in the individual and group supplemental insurance markets. Aflac's individual policies are portable, meaning that individuals may retain their full insurance coverage upon separation from employment or affiliation with a group, generally at the same premium. Individual policies are typically guaranteed-renewable for the lifetime of the policyholder (to age 75 for short-term disability policies). \n5\nItem 1. Business\nInsurance Products\nAccident\nAccident Insurance\n \nAflac U.S. offers accident coverage on both an individual and group basis. These policies pay cash benefits in the event of a covered injury. The accident portion of the policy includes lump-sum benefits for accidental death, dismemberment and specific injuries as well as fixed benefits for hospital confinement. Additional benefits are also available for home modifications, wellness and increased benefits for injuries related to participation in an organized sporting activity.\nDisability\nDisability Insurance\n \nAflac U.S. offers short-term disability benefits on both an individual and group basis and long-term disability benefits on a group basis. These plans provide coverage for covered injury, illness or mental health conditions.\nCritical Care\nCancer Insurance\n \n Aflac U.S.'s cancer insurance products provide a lump-sum benefit upon initial diagnosis of cancer and subsequent benefits for treatment received due to cancer. Aflac U.S. offers cancer insurance on an individual basis.\nCritical Illness Insurance\n \nAflac U.S. offers coverage for critical illness plans on both an individual and group basis. These policies are designed to pay cash benefits in the event of critical illnesses such as heart attack, stroke or cancer. \nHospital Indemnity\nHospital Indemnity Insurance\n \nAflac U.S. offers hospital indemnity coverage on both an individual and group basis. Hospital indemnity products provide policyholders fixed dollar benefits triggered by hospitalization due to accident or sickness. Indemnity benefits for inpatient and outpatient surgeries, as well as various other diagnostic events, are also available. Aflac U.S. also offers a lump sum rider for a range of critical illness events that can be added to its individual accident, short-term disability and hospital indemnity products.\nDental and Vision\nDental and Vision Insurance\n  Aflac U.S. offers network dental and vision products on a group basis, as well as fixed-benefit dental coverage on an individual basis. Aflac U.S. also offers Aflac Vision Now\nSM\n, an individually issued policy that provides benefits for serious eye health conditions and loss of sight as well as coverage for corrective eye materials and exam benefits.\nLife\nLife Insurance\n \n \nAflac U.S. offers term- and whole-life policies on both an individual and group basis. \nSeasonality\nIn recent years, new annualized premium sales are generally higher in the fourth quarter for Aflac U.S. group business due to the timing of open enrollment for many employers. As a result, approximately half of total new annualized premium sales for Aflac U.S. group business are generated in the fourth quarter, which typically results in over one third of total Aflac U.S. total sales being generated in the fourth quarter.\nDistribution Channels\nIndependent Associates/Career Agents\n \nThe career agent channel in Aflac U.S. focuses on marketing Aflac to the small business market, defined as employers of between three and 99 employees. Sales associates in the U.S. are independent contractors and are paid commissions and other variable compensation based on first-year and renewal premiums from their sales of insurance products. \n6\nItem 1. Business\nBrokers\n \n \nThe broker channel of Aflac U.S. focuses on selling to the mid- and large-case market, which is comprised of employers with 100 or more employees and typically an average size of 1,000 employees or more. Brokers in the U.S. are independent contractors and are paid commissions based on first-year and renewal premiums from their sales of insurance products.\nIn 2024, the Aflac U.S. sales force included an average of approximately 6,000 U.S. agents, including brokers, who were actively producing business on a weekly basis. For additional information, see the Aflac U.S. Segment subsection of Item 7. MD&A.\nConsumer Markets\n \nWhile Aflac U.S. primarily markets its insurance products at the worksite, Aflac U.S. is also expanding its distribution strategy to directly reach consumers outside of the traditional worksite through digital lead generation.  \nCompetitive Markets\nAflac U.S. competes against several supplemental insurance carriers on a national and regional basis. Aflac U.S. believes its policies, premium rates, platforms, value-added services and sales commissions are competitive by product type. Moreover, Aflac U.S. believes that its products are distinct from competitive offerings given its product focus (including features, benefits and claims service model), distribution capabilities and brand awareness. \nSince Aflac products provide an additional level of financial protection for policyholders, the Company believes the increased financial exposure some employees may face creates a favorable opportunity for Aflac U.S. products. However, given the profitability erosion some major medical carriers are facing in their core lines of business, the Company has seen a more competitive landscape as these carriers seek entry into Aflac's supplemental product segments and leverage their core benefit offerings by bundling and discounting products in order to gain market share.\nGovernment Regulation\nState Insurance Regulation\n \nThe Parent Company and its U.S. insurance subsidiaries, Aflac, CAIC, TOIC (Nebraska-domiciled insurance companies), Aflac New York (a New York-domiciled insurance company) and ABS (a licensed third-party administrator in most U.S. jurisdictions and a pre-paid limited health service organization in Florida) are subject to state regulations in the U.S. as an insurance holding company system. Such regulations generally provide that certain transactions between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable. In addition, transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries and certain transactions between companies within the system, including management fees, loans and advances are subject to prior notice to, or approval by, state regulatory authorities. These laws generally require, among other things, the insurance holding company and each insurance company directly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance departments of their respective domiciliary states and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system.\nLike all U.S. insurance companies, Aflac, CAIC, TOIC and Aflac New York are subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business. In general, the insurance laws of the various jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to, among other things:\n•\ngranting and revoking licenses to transact business\n•\nregulating trade and claims practices\n•\nlicensing of insurance agents and brokers\n•\napproval of policy forms and premium rates\n•\nstandards of solvency and maintenance of specified policy benefit reserves and minimum loss ratio requirements\n•\ncapital requirements\n•\nlimitations on dividends to shareholders\n•\nthe nature of and limitations on investments\n•\ndeposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders\n•\nfiling of financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory insurance accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities\n•\nperiodic examinations of the market conduct, financial, and other affairs of insurance companies\nThe insurance laws of Nebraska that govern the Company's activities provide that the acquisition or change of “control” of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the Nebraska Department of Insurance (NDOI). A person seeking to acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domestic insurance company or of any person controlling a domestic insurance company (in the case of Aflac, CAIC and TOIC, the \n7\nItem 1. Business\nParent Company) must generally file with the NDOI an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy to the Company. In Nebraska, control is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, acquires 10% or more of an insurance company or of any other person or entity controlling the insurance company. The 10% presumption is not conclusive and control may be found to exist at less than 10%. Similar laws apply in New York, the domiciliary jurisdiction of Aflac's New York insurance subsidiary.\nState insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). In 2024, the NDOI and the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) commenced full-scope, risk-focused financial examinations on their respective state domiciled insurance entities covering the reporting period January 1, 2020 – December 31, 2023 that are currently ongoing. Additionally, in 2023, the NYSDFS commenced a routine market conduct examination on Aflac New York covering the five-year period ended on December 31, 2022 that is currently ongoing.\nNAIC Risk-Based Capital\n \nThe NAIC continually reviews regulatory matters, such as risk-based capital (RBC) modernization, group capital calculations and liquidity risk assessment. The NAIC uses an RBC formula relating to insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk to facilitate identification by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mix of risk inherent in the insurer's operations. The formulas for determining the amount of RBC specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company's regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level RBC as defined by the NAIC. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The levels are company action, regulatory action, authorized control, and mandatory control. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 7. MD&A for additional information on RBC.\nGuaranty Association and Similar Arrangements\n \n \nUnder state insurance guaranty association laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions, the Company is subject to assessments, based on the share of business the Company writes in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. In the U.S., some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. The Company's policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domicile's statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium upon which the assessment is based is written. In most states, the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction. \nFederal Regulation\n \n \nFederal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including health care reform legislation, financial services reform legislation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation, can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. Certain federal regulations applicable to Aflac U.S. are outlined below.  \n•\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA), federal health care reform legislation, gave the U.S. federal government direct regulatory authority over the business of health insurance. The ACA, as enacted, does not require material changes in the design of the Company's insurance products. However, indirect consequences of, or changes to, the legislation and regulations could present challenges that could potentially have an impact on the Company's sales model, financial condition and results of operations. Certain provisions of the ACA have been and may continue to be subject to challenge through litigation, the ultimate effects of which on the ACA are uncertain. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for the risk factor entitled, \"Extensive regulation and changes in legislation can impact profitability and growth\" for additional information. \n•\nDodd-Frank Act\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank) and regulations issued thereunder, in particular rules to require central clearing for certain types of derivatives, may have an impact on the Company's derivative activity, including activity on behalf of Aflac Japan. \n8\nItem 1. Business\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) under the U.S. Department of the Treasury to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance. \n•\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity \nIn the absence of a comprehensive federal privacy law, states are making a push towards privacy legislation. Personally identifiable information is used in support of many of the Company's business processes. For many years, the standard for protection and treatment of that data was benchmarked by privacy and security provisions of the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) and in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). As consumers have grown more concerned about the protection of their data, as well as how their data is used by organizations, jurisdictions within and outside of the U.S. have created legislation and issued regulations that apply or may in the future apply to aspects of Aflac U.S. operations and allow consumers the right to access, correct, delete, or opt out of the sale, share, or use of their data. Although not all apply to Aflac U.S. operations, examples of these types of legislation include the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), UK Data Protection Act of 2018 (UK DPA), Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CDPA), Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA), Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA), Colorado Privacy Act (CPA), Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA), Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MCDPA) and Nebraska Data Privacy Act (NDPA).\nCybersecurity continues to be an area of evolving focus for legislation and regulatory activity. In addition to the information required by Item 1C. Cybersecurity of this report, industry regulators as well as the federal government have updated existing standards and increased their focus on enforcement. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued an updated version of the Cybersecurity Framework as well as guidelines on managing risks associated with the use of artificial intelligence and the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published additional security guidelines related to ransomware and software security. Additionally, certain states are adopting the NAIC Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers.\nThe Company has a cross-functional team that tracks and monitors new and emerging legislation and regulations to ensure privacy and cybersecurity programs are evaluated and comply with regulatory requirements. This includes a robust third-party risk management and assessment program. Over the last several years, processes have developed to support the data subject request process required by CCPA, privacy impact assessments have been implemented as required by CPRA and a dedicated privacy and security center has been added to the Company website to provide consumers with information about the use of and protection of their data.\nFor further information concerning Aflac U.S. operations, see the Aflac U.S. Segment subsection of Item 7. MD&A and Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCORPORATE AND OTHER\nThe Company's other operations include the Parent Company, Aflac Global Ventures LLC and its subsidiaries, asset management subsidiaries, results of reinsurance activities including Aflac Re Bermuda Ltd. (Aflac Re), and a printing subsidiary. \nInvestments of Aflac U.S., as well as certain sub-advised assets of Aflac Japan, are managed by the Company’s U.S. asset management subsidiary, Aflac Asset Management LLC (AAM), and investments of Aflac Japan are managed pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between Aflac Japan and the Company's asset management subsidiary in Japan, Aflac Asset Management Japan Ltd. (AAMJ). AAMJ is licensed as a discretionary asset manager under the Japan Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and is subject to rules of the Japan Investment Advisors Association, a self-regulatory organization with mandatory membership for Japan investment managers. AAM is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. AAM and AAMJ are reported in Corporate and other; however, the assets that they manage are reported in the respective Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. segments.\nAflac Re is a Bermuda domiciled insurer that reinsures certain policies issued by ALIJ. Aflac Re is subject to regulation in Bermuda, where the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) has broad administrative powers relating to granting and revoking licenses to transact reinsurance business, approval of specific reinsurance transactions, capital requirements and solvency standards, limitations on dividends to shareholders, the nature of and limitations on investments, and the filing of financial statements in accordance with prescribed or permitted accounting practices.\n9\nItem 1. Business\nFor additional information on the Company's other operations, see the Corporate and other subsection of Item 7. MD&A and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nHUMAN CAPITAL\nThe Company’s overarching human capital philosophy is, “If you take care of your employees, your employees will take care of the business.” The Company's compensation and benefit expense totaled approximately $2.0 billion in 2024 and $1.9 billion in 2023. The Company believes its employee relations are generally satisfactory.\nThe following table details the number of full-time employees as of December 31.\n2024\nAflac Japan\n6,737\n \nAflac U.S.\n5,041\n \nCorporate and other\n916\n \nTotal\n12,694\n \nTalent\nThe Company uses internal and external resources to attract, retain and develop talent across a variety of backgrounds and demographics. \nAflac Japan seeks top-tier talent through annual recruitment of new university graduates as well as mid-career recruitment of those with specialty skills or expertise. For its employees, Aflac Japan implements standard and unified training and development programs focusing on a range of business skills.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nPerformance Highlights \nFor the full year of 2024, total revenues were up 1.2% to $18.9 billion, compared with $18.7 billion for the full year of 2023. Net earnings were $5.4 billion, or $9.63 per diluted share, for the full year of 2024, compared with $4.7 billion, or $7.78 per diluted share, for the full year of 2023. \nNet earnings in 2024 included net investment gains of $1.3 billion, compared with net investment gains of $590 million in 2023. Net investment gains in 2024 included an increase in credit loss allowances of $256 million; $1.1 billion of net gains from certain derivative and foreign currency gains or losses; $140 million of net gains on equity securities; and $259 million of net gains from sales and redemptions.\nThe average yen/dollar exchange rate\n(1)\n in 2024 was 150.97, or 6.9% weaker than the rate of 140.57 in 2023.\nAdjusted earnings\n(2)\n for the full year of 2024 were $4.1 billion, or $7.21 per diluted share, compared with $3.7 billion, or $6.23 per diluted share, in 2023. The weaker yen/dollar exchange rate negatively impacted adjusted earnings per diluted share by $.18.\nIn 2024, Aflac Incorporated repurchased $2.8 billion, or 30.4 million of its common shares. At December 31, 2024, the Company had 47.3 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. \nShareholders’ equity was $26.1 billion, or $47.45 per share, at December 31, 2024, compared with $22.0 billion, or $38.00 per share, at December 31, 2023. Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2024 included a cumulative increase of $2.0 billion from the effect of changes in discount rate assumptions on insurance contracts, compared with a corresponding cumulative decrease of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2023, and a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $4 million, compared with a net unrealized gain of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2023. Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2024 also included an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of $5.0 billion, compared with an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of $4.1 billion at December 31, 2023. The annualized return on average shareholders’ equity in 2024 was 22.6%.\nShareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)\n(2)\n (adjusted book value) was $29.1 billion, or $52.87 per share, at December 31, 2024, compared with $27.5 billion, or $47.55 per share, at December 31, 2023. Adjusted book value excluding foreign currency remeasurement\n(2)\n was $23.4 billion, or $42.46 per share, at December 31, 2024, compared with $23.8 billion, or $41.15 per share, at December 31, 2023. The annualized adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency remeasurement\n(2)\n in 2024 was 17.3%.\n(1) \nYen/U.S. dollar exchange rates are based on the published MUFG Bank, Ltd. telegraphic transfer middle rate (TTM).\n(2) \nSee the Results of Operations section of this MD&A for a definition of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure.\nINDUSTRY TRENDS \nThe Company is impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight and a variety of trends that affect the industries where it competes.\nFinancial and Economic Environment\nThe Company’s business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on the Company, in part because the Company has a large investment portfolio and its insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for the risk factor entitled, \"Difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy could have a material adverse effect on the Company's investments, capital position, revenue, profitability, and liquidity and harm the Company's business.\"\n33\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nDemographics\nAflac Japan Segment\nWith Japan’s aging population and the rise in healthcare costs, supplemental health care insurance products remain attractive. Additionally, as Japan enters an era of 100-year lifespans, customers' needs for asset formation and retirement coverage, including nursing care, are increasing. Japan’s existing customers and potential customers seek products that are easily understood, cost-effective and can be accessed through technology-enabled devices.\nAflac U.S. Segment\nCustomer demographics continue to evolve and new opportunities present themselves in different customer segments such as the millennial and multicultural markets. Customer expectations and preferences are changing. Trends indicate existing customers and potential customers seek cost-effective solutions that are easily understood and can be accessed through technology-enabled devices. Additionally, income protection and the health needs of retiring baby boomers are continuing to shape the insurance industry.\nRegulatory Environment\nSee Item 1. Business - Aflac Japan Government Regulation and Aflac U.S. Government Regulation for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the Company and the associated risks.\nCompetitive Environment\nSee Item 1. Business - Aflac Japan Competitive Markets and Aflac U.S. Competitive Markets for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which the Company competes in each of its segments.\n2025 OUTLOOK \nThe Company’s strategy to drive long-term shareholder value is to pursue growth and strong profit margins and to exercise tactical capital deployment. The Company's approach to pursue growth is through product development and distribution expansion and to achieve efficiencies by modernizing its technology and streamlining its operations.  \nThe Company's objectives in 2025 include maintaining strong pretax margins with increased sales production through product refreshments and growth initiatives in both its Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. segments. For Aflac Japan, this includes continuing to focus on third sector products as well as introducing policies to new and younger customers. For Aflac U.S., this includes continuing to focus on realizing benefits from its buy to build initiatives and other platform investments, maintaining strong expense management discipline and strengthening the number of career agents for Aflac U.S. The Company believes that its strategy of positioning itself for future growth and efficiency while defending and leveraging its market-leading position, powerful brand recognition and varied distribution in Japan and the U.S. will provide support toward these objectives.\nIn December 2024, the board of directors announced a 16.0% increase in the quarterly cash dividend, effective with the first quarter of 2025.  The Company intends to maintain strong capital ratios in Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. in support of its commitment to shareholder dividends while remaining tactical in its deployment of capital in the form of share repurchases and opportunistic investments. The Company's economic solvency ratio (ESR) target range is 170% to 230% for Aflac Japan and a target combined RBC range of 350% to 450%, over time, for Aflac U.S., which is consistent with the Company's risk management practices. \nAflac Japan Segment\nFor Aflac Japan, the Company anticipates that favorable morbidity experience and the shift in premiums over the last several years from first sector savings products to third sector cancer and medical products and first sector protection products will result in stable benefit ratios in the Aflac Japan segment with a slightly higher expense ratio reflecting growth and strategic initiatives. The Company also expects that benefit and expense ratios will continue to experience some level of revenue pressure due to the impact of paid up policies and internal reinsurance transactions. For the 2025 through 2027 period, the Company expects Aflac Japan to generate a\n benefit ratio in the range of 64% to 66% and an expense ratio in the range of 20% to 23%. For 2025, the Company expects the benefit ratio to be toward the higher end of the 64% to 66% range and the expense ratio to be on the lower end of the 20% to 23% range.\n34\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nAflac U.S. Segment\nFor Aflac U.S., the Company expects growth in life and disability to increase benefit ratios. This growth as well as realized benefits from the buy to build initiatives are expected to decrease expense ratios over time. For the 2025 through 2027 period, the Company expects Aflac U.S. to generate a benefit ratio in the range of 48% to 52% and an expense ratio in the range of 36% to 39%. For 2025, the Company expects the benefit ratio to be at the lower end of the 48% to 52% range and the expense ratio to be at the higher end of the 36% to 39% range.\nCorporate and other\nThe Company's objectives for Corporate and other in 2025 include maintaining strong pretax adjusted earnings as compared with 2024, assuming that U.S. interest rates remain stable and excluding the impact of tax credit investments, as tax benefits are recognized in a corresponding lower income tax expense.\nFor important disclosures applicable to statements made in this 2025 Outlook, please see the statement on Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of Item 1. Business, the Risk Factors identified in Item 1A. and this Item 7. MD&A.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company earns its revenues principally from insurance premiums and investments. The Company’s operating expenses primarily consist of insurance benefits provided and reserves established for anticipated future insurance benefits, general business expenses, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing its products. Profitability for the Company depends principally on its ability to price its insurance products at a level that enables the Company to earn a margin over the costs associated with providing benefits and administering those products. Profitability also depends on, among other items, actuarial and policyholder behavior experience on insurance products, and the Company's ability to attract and retain customer assets, generate and maintain favorable investment results, effectively deploy capital and utilize tax capacity, and manage expenses.  \nThis document includes references to the Company’s financial performance measures which are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) (non-U.S. GAAP). The financial measures exclude items that the Company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations.\nDue to the size of Aflac Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. A significant portion of the Company’s business is conducted in yen and never converted into dollars but translated into dollars for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, which results in foreign currency impact to earnings, cash flows and book value on a U.S. GAAP basis. Management evaluates the Company's financial performance both including and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation to monitor, respectively, cumulative currency impacts and the currency-neutral operating performance over time. The average yen/dollar exchange rate is based on the published MUFG Bank, Ltd. telegraphic transfer middle rate (TTM).\n35\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nThe Company defines the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this document as follows:\n•\nAdjusted earnings\n are adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses. Adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are the adjusted earnings for the period divided by the weighted average outstanding shares (basic or diluted) for the period presented. The adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that are outside of management’s control because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or are related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations. Adjusted revenues are U.S. GAAP total revenues excluding adjusted net investment gains and losses. Adjusted expenses are U.S. GAAP total acquisition and operating expenses including the impact of interest from derivatives associated with notes payable but excluding any non-recurring or other items not associated with the normal course of the Company’s insurance operations and that do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance. Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to evaluate the financial performance of the Company’s insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of these financial measures is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company’s insurance business. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.\n•\nAdjusted net investment gains and losses \nare net investment gains and losses adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, ii) net interest income/expense from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are both reclassified to net investment income, and iii) the impact of interest from derivatives associated with notes payable, which is reclassified to interest expense as a component of total adjusted expenses. The Company considers adjusted net investment gains and losses important as it represents the remainder amount that is considered outside management’s control, while excluding the components that are within management’s control and are accordingly reclassified to net investment income and interest expense. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted net investment gains and losses is net investment gains and losses.\n•\nAmortized hedge costs/income\n represent costs/income incurred or recognized as a result of using foreign currency derivatives to hedge certain foreign exchange risks in the Company's Japan segment or in Corporate and other. These amortized hedge costs/income are estimated at the inception of the derivatives based on the specific terms of each contract and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the derivative. The Company believes that amortized hedge costs/income measure the periodic currency risk management costs/income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income. There is no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for amortized hedge costs/income.\n•\nAdjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact\n are computed using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior-year period, which eliminates fluctuations driven solely by foreign currency exchange rate changes. Adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact important because a significant portion of the Company's business is conducted in Japan and foreign exchange rates are outside management’s control; therefore, the Company believes it is important to understand the impact of translating foreign currency (primarily Japanese yen) into U.S. dollars. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively. \n•\nAdjusted book value \nis the U.S. GAAP book value (representing total shareholders’ equity), less AOCI as recorded on the U.S. GAAP balance sheet. Adjusted book value per common share is adjusted book value at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share important as they exclude AOCI, which fluctuates due to market movements that are outside management’s control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.\n36\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \n•\nAdjusted book value excluding foreign currency remeasurement \nis the U.S. GAAP book value (representing total shareholders’ equity), less AOCI as recorded on the U.S. GAAP balance sheet and excluding the cumulative [beginning January 1, 2021] foreign currency gains/losses associated with i) foreign currency remeasurement and ii) sales and redemptions of invested assets. Adjusted book value excluding foreign currency remeasurement per common share is adjusted book value excluding foreign currency remeasurement at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value excluding foreign currency remeasurement and adjusted book value excluding foreign currency remeasurement per common share important as they exclude both AOCI and the cumulative foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value excluding foreign currency remeasurement and adjusted book value excluding foreign currency remeasurement per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.\n•\nAdjusted return on equity\n is annualized adjusted earnings divided by average shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI. Management uses adjusted return on equity to evaluate the financial performance of the Company’s insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of this financial measure is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company’s insurance business. The Company considers adjusted return on equity important as it excludes components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity is return on average equity (ROE) as determined using annualized net earnings and average total shareholders’ equity.\n•\nAdjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency remeasurement \nis annualized adjusted earnings divided by average shareholders’ equity, excluding both AOCI and the cumulative [beginning January 1, 2021] foreign currency gains/losses associated with i) foreign currency remeasurement and ii) sales and redemptions of invested assets. The Company considers adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency remeasurement important because it excludes both AOCI and the cumulative foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency remeasurement is ROE as determined using annualized net earnings and average total shareholders’ equity.\n•\nU.S. dollar-denominated investment income excluding foreign currency impact\n represents amounts excluding foreign currency impact on U.S. dollar-denominated investment income using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior year period. The Company considers U.S. dollar-denominated investment income excluding foreign currency impact important as it eliminates the impact of foreign currency changes on the Aflac Japan segment results, which are outside management’s control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for U.S. dollar-denominated investment income excluding foreign currency impact is the corresponding net investment income amount from the U.S. dollar denominated investments translated to yen.\n37\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nThe following table is a reconciliation of items impacting adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures of net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, respectively, for the years ended December 31.\nReconciliation of Net Earnings to Adjusted Earnings\nIn Millions\nPer Diluted Share\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet earnings\n$\n5,443\n \n$\n4,659 \n$\n9.63\n \n$\n7.78 \nItems impacting net earnings:\nAdjusted net investment (gains) losses \n(1)\n(1,495)\n(914)\n(2.65)\n(1.53)\nOther and non-recurring (income) loss\n23\n \n(39)\n.04\n \n(.07)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense on items \n  excluded from adjusted earnings\n101\n \n26 \n.18\n \n.04 \nAdjusted earnings\n4,072\n \n3,733 \n7.21\n \n6.23 \nCurrent period foreign currency impact \n(2)\n103\n \nN/A\n.18\n \nN/A\nAdjusted earnings excluding current period \n   foreign currency impact\n$\n4,175\n \n$\n3,733 \n$\n7.39\n \n$\n6.23 \n(1)\n See reconciliation of net investment (gains) losses to adjusted net investment (gains) losses below.\n(2)\n Prior period foreign currency impact reflected as “N/A” to isolate change for current period only.\nReconciling Items\nNet Investment Gains and Losses\nThe following table is a reconciliation of items impacting adjusted net investment (gains) losses to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures of net investment (gains) losses for the years ended December 31.\nReconciliation of Net Investment (Gains) Losses to Adjusted Net Investment (Gains) Losses\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet investment (gains) losses\n$\n(1,271)\n$\n(590)\nItems impacting net investment (gains) losses:\nAmortized hedge costs\n(26)\n(157)\nAmortized hedge income\n113\n \n121 \nNet interest income (expense) from derivatives associated with certain \n   investment strategies\n(338)\n(328)\nImpact of interest from derivatives associated with notes payable\n27\n \n41 \nAdjusted net investment (gains) losses\n$\n(1,495)\n$\n(914)\nThe Company's investment strategy is to invest primarily in fixed maturity securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the Company’s profitability. This investment strategy incorporates asset-liability matching (ALM) to align the expected cash flows of the portfolio to the needs of the Company's liability structure. The Company does not purchase securities with the intent of generating investment gains or losses. However, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and/or general portfolio management and rebalancing. The realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of the Company's insurance products. \nNet investment gains and losses excluded from adjusted earnings include the following: \n•\nSecurities Transactions \n•\nCredit Losses \n•\nChanges in the Fair Value of Equity Securities\n•\nCertain Derivative and Foreign Currency Activities.\n38\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nSecurities Transactions, Credit Losses and Changes in the Fair Value of Equity Securities\nSecurities transactions include gains and losses from sales and redemptions of investments where the amount received is different from the amortized cost of the investment. Credit losses include losses for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities, available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, loan receivables, loan commitments and reinsurance recoverables. Changes in the fair value of equity securities are the result of gains or losses driven by fluctuations in market prices.\nCertain Derivative and Foreign Currency Activities\nThe Company's derivative activities include:\n•\nforeign currency forwards and options used in hedging foreign exchange risk on U.S. dollar-denominated investments in Aflac Japan's portfolio, with options used on a standalone basis and/or in a collar strategy;\n•\nforeign currency forwards and options used to economically hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen and hedge the Company's long term exposure to a weakening yen;\n•\ncross-currency interest rate swaps, also referred to as foreign currency swaps, associated with certain senior notes and subordinated debentures; \n•\nforeign currency swaps that are associated with variable interest entity (VIE) bond purchase commitments, and investments in special-purpose entities, including VIEs where the Company is the primary beneficiary;\n•\ninterest rate swaps used to economically hedge interest rate fluctuations in certain variable-rate investments;\n•\ninterest rate swaptions used to hedge changes in the fair value associated with interest rate fluctuations for certain U.S. dollar-denominated available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities; and\n•\nbond purchase commitments at the inception of investments in consolidated VIEs.\nGains and losses are recognized as a result of valuing these derivatives, net of the effects of hedge accounting. \nThe Company also excludes from adjusted earnings the accounting impacts of foreign currency remeasurement associated with changes in the foreign currency exchange rate. \nFor additional information regarding net investment gains and losses, including details of reported amounts for the periods presented, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther and Non-recurring Items\nThe U.S. insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. The system can result in periodic charges to the Company as a result of insolvencies/bankruptcies that occur with other companies in the life insurance industry. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. These charges neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance, but result from external situations not controlled by the Company. The Company excludes any charges associated with U.S. guaranty fund assessments and the corresponding tax benefit or expense from adjusted earnings.\nIn Japan, the government also requires the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers; however, these costs are calculated and administered differently than in the U.S.  In Japan, these costs are not directly related to specific insolvencies or bankruptcies, but are rather a regular operational cost for an insurance company. Based on this structure, the Company does not remove the Japan policyholder protection expenses from adjusted earnings.\nThe Company considers the costs associated with the early redemption of its debt to be unrelated to the underlying fundamentals and trends in its insurance operations. Additionally, these costs are driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to the issuance of the debt, and the Company considers these interest rate changes to represent economic conditions not directly associated with its insurance operations.\n39\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nIn 2024, as part of the U.S. defined benefit plan freeze, the Company offered lump sum payments to certain participants. The lump sum payments were distributed in the fourth quarter of 2024 and resulted in a settlement charge of $18 million in 2024 due to the payments being greater than the settlement threshold. The settlement charge was both unusual and non-recurring and unrelated to other recurring benefit costs associated with the plan; therefore, the Company excluded the settlement charge from adjusted earnings.\nIn June 2023, the Company amended the U.S. defined benefit plan to freeze future benefits under the plan for all participants effective January 1, 2024, which resulted in the Company recognizing a curtailment gain of approximately $49 million in 2023. The curtailment gain was both unusual and non-recurring and unrelated to other recurring benefit costs associated with the plan; therefore, the Company excluded the curtailment gain from adjusted earnings.\nIn 2023, other items excluded from adjusted earnings included an impairment for certain finite-lived intangible assets of approximately $11 million as a result of the Company exiting the third-party administration business acquired in connection with the purchase of Aflac Benefits Solutions, Inc. in 2019. The impairment of these intangible assets was not related to the ongoing operations of the business and occurs infrequently; therefore, the Company excluded the impairment from adjusted earnings. \nForeign Currency Translation\nAflac Japan’s premiums and a significant portion of its investment income are received in yen, and its claims and most expenses are paid in yen. Aflac Japan purchases yen-denominated assets and U.S. dollar-denominated assets, which may be hedged to yen, to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. Yen-denominated income statement accounts are translated to U.S. dollars using the weighted average Japanese yen/U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate for the reporting period, except realized gains and losses on securities transactions which are translated at the exchange rate on the trade date of each transaction. Yen-denominated balance sheet accounts are translated to U.S. dollars using the spot Japanese yen/U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.\nIn recent periods, the Japanese yen has weakened against the U.S. dollar. Although the Company is unable to predict the timing or extent of future movements of the Japanese yen/U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate, the Company maintains hedging strategies (see the Hedging Activities section of this MD&A) that are intended to mitigate the impacts of yen fluctuation on the Company’s financial position and results of operations. See the risk factor entitled “The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information.\nIncome Taxes \nThe Company's combined U.S. and Japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was \n15.2% in 2024 and \n11.5% in 2023. The combined effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to historic and solar tax credits and the exclusion of foreign currency translation gains and losses on certain Aflac Japan U.S. dollar-denominated assets held in the Delaware Statutory Trust (DST). Total income taxes were $974 million in 2024 and $603 million in 2023. Japanese income taxes on Aflac Japan's results account for most of the Company's consolidated income tax expense. \nFor additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Estimates - Income Taxes section of this MD&A. The effective tax rate continues to be subject to future tax law changes both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. See the risk factor entitled \"Tax rates applicable to the Company may change\" in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.\n40\nItem 7.

The impact is the difference of adjusted return on equity - reported compared with adjusted return on equity, excluding from shareholders' equity, gains/losses associated with foreign currency remeasurement.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT\nU.S. GAAP financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual and interim period financial statements. Furthermore, the Company is required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets. The Company's insurance business consists of two segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. Aflac Japan is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings. In addition, the Parent Company, other business units that are not individually reportable, and business activities, including reinsurance activities, not included in Aflac Japan or Aflac U.S. are included in Corporate and other. See Item 1. Business for a summary of each segment's products and distribution channels. \nConsistent with U.S. GAAP guidance for segment reporting, pretax adjusted earnings is the Company's U.S. GAAP measure of segment performance. The Company believes that a presentation of this measure is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of its business. Additional performance measures used to evaluate the financial condition and performance of the Company's segments are listed below. \n•\nOperating Ratios\n•\nNew Annualized Premium Sales\n•\nNew Money Yield \n•\nReturn on Average Invested Assets\n•\nAverage Weekly Producer\n•\nPremium Persistency\nFor additional information on the Company’s performance measures included in this MD&A, see the Glossary of Selected Terms found directly following Part IV. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the reconciliation of segment results to the Company's consolidated U.S. GAAP results and additional information.\n42\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nAFLAC JAPAN SEGMENT\nAflac Japan Pretax Adjusted Earnings\nChanges in Aflac Japan's pretax adjusted earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \n•\nTotal benefits and claims decreased primarily due to ¥50 billion of reserve remeasurement gains related to assumption updates in the third quarter of 2024 as well as internal reinsurance activity.\n•\nTotal adjusted expenses decreased primarily due to internal reinsurance activity.\n•\nPretax adjusted earnings increased primarily due to the decrease in both total benefits and claims and total adjusted expenses, partially offset by the decrease in total adjusted revenues.\nAnnualized premiums in force decreased 3.0% to ¥1.21 trillion as of December 31, 2024, compared with ¥1.25 trillion in 2023. The decrease in annualized premiums in force in yen of 3.0% in 2024 was driven primarily by limited-pay products reaching premium paid-up status. Annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year-end exchange rates, were $7.6 billion in 2024, compared with $8.8 billion in 2023. As of December 31, 2024, Aflac Japan exceeded 22 million individual policies in force in Japan, with more than 14 million cancer policies in force in Japan.\nAflac Japan's investment portfolios include U.S. dollar-denominated securities and reverse dual-currency securities (yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). In years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total adjusted revenues, and pretax adjusted earnings in yen terms. In years when the yen weakens, translating U.S. dollar-denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total adjusted revenues, and pretax adjusted earnings in yen terms. \nThe following table illustrates the effect of translating Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had foreign currency exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year. Amounts excluding foreign currency impact on U.S. dollar-denominated investment income were determined using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior year period.

Additionally, the Company believes that sales of first sector products, including \nTsumitasu\n, WAYS and Child Endowment, position Aflac Japan for potential future long-term sales opportunities by marketing these products to a younger demographic as well as potential cross-selling opportunities of Aflac Japan's third sector products.\nAflac Japan continues to promote digital and web-based sales to groups and use of its system that enables smart device-based insurance application by allowing the customer and an Aflac Japan operator to see the same screen through their smart devices.

At December 31, 2024, Aflac Japan was represented by approximately 6,600 sales agencies, with approximately 114,000 licensed sales associates employed by those agencies. The number of sales agencies has declined in recent years due to Aflac Japan's focus on supporting agencies with strong management frameworks, high productivity and more producing agents.\nAt December 31, 2024, Aflac Japan had agreements to sell its products at 360 banks, approximately 90% of the total number of banks in Japan.\nStrategic Alliance with Japan Post Holdings\nOn May 10, 2024, the Parent Company reported that the shares owned by the J&A Alliance Trust (Trust) represented, in aggregate, 20% of the voting power of the Parent Company's common stock. The Shareholders Agreement, entered into on February 28, 2019, by the Parent Company, Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd., J&A Alliance Holdings Corporation, solely in its capacity as trustee of the Trust and General Incorporated Association J&A Alliance, provides voting restrictions that require the Trust to vote (i) all shares representing voting rights in excess of 20% of the voting rights in the Parent Company and (ii) all of its shares in connection with a change in control transaction, in each case, in a manner proportionally equal to votes of shares not beneficially owned by the Trust. Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd. does not have a board seat on the Parent Company’s board of directors and does not have rights to control, manage or intervene in the management of the Parent Company. According to a Form 13F filed by Japan Post Holdings with the SEC on January 16, 2025, Japan Post Holdings owned 52.3 million Aflac Incorporated common shares as of December 31, 2024.\nAs previously reported, on December 19, 2018, the Parent Company and Aflac Japan entered into a Basic Agreement with Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation (Japan Post Holdings). Pursuant to the terms of the Basic Agreement, among other items, Japan Post Holdings and Aflac Japan agreed to reconfirm existing initiatives regarding cancer insurance and to consider new joint initiatives. In June 2021, the Parent Company, Aflac Japan and Japan Post Group agreed to pursue several specific initiatives toward building a \"'Co-creation Platform' to support customers and local communities,\" consistent with Japan Post Group's medium-term management plan announced in May 2021. The initiatives are directed at, among other items, the promotion of Aflac Japan cancer insurance, digital transformation within the Japan Post Group, and certain diversity efforts.\nOn May 1, 2023, the Parent Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 that registered the sale of its common stock from time to time by J&A Alliance Holdings Corporation in its capacity as trustee of the Trust. The filing was made pursuant to a contractual requirement contained in the Shareholders Agreement. The Trust has agreed not to own more than the greater of 10% of the Parent Company’s outstanding shares or such shares representing 22.5% of the voting rights in the Parent Company.\nThe foregoing is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Basic Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed December 19, 2018, and the Shareholders Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.50 to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed April 26, 2019, the terms of which exhibits are incorporated herein by reference. \nAflac Japan Investments\nThe level of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations, the timing of investing the cash flow, yields on new investments, the effect of yen/dollar exchange rates on U.S. dollar-denominated investment income, and other factors.\nAs part of the Company's portfolio management and asset allocation process, Aflac Japan invests in yen and U.S. dollar-denominated investments. Yen-denominated investments primarily consist of JGBs, public and private fixed maturity \n46\nItem 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nIn 2024, operating results compared to the previous year were as follows:\n•\nNet earned premiums increased primarily due to higher net earned premiums from growth initiatives including group life and disability and consumer markets businesses.\n•\nAdjusted net investment income increased primarily due to higher fixed rate income and higher variable income.\n•\nTotal adjusted revenues increased primarily due to the increase in both net earned premiums and adjusted net investment income.\n•\nTotal benefits and claims increased primarily due to a decrease of approximately $139 million in reserve remeasurement gains related to assumption updates in the third quarter of 2024 and higher incurred claims.\n•\nTotal adjusted expenses decreased primarily due to improved expense efficiency.\n•\nPretax adjusted earnings decreased primarily due to the increase in total benefits and claims, partially offset by the increase in total adjusted revenues and the decrease in total adjusted expenses.\nAnnualized premiums in force increased 3.6% in 2024 and 3.3% in 2023. Annualized premiums in force at December 31 were $6.4 billion in 2024, compared with $6.2 billion in 2023.\nThe following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac U.S. for the years ended December 31 followed by a discussion of the significant drivers of changes in operating ratios compared to the previous year.\n \nRatios to total adjusted revenues:\n2024\n2023\nTotal benefits and claims\n40.5\n \n%\n36.7 \n%\nAdjusted expenses:\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\n7.9\n \n7.4 \nInsurance commissions\n8.4\n \n8.5 \nInsurance and other expenses\n22.3\n \n24.8 \nTotal adjusted expenses\n38.5\n \n40.6 \nPretax adjusted earnings\n21.1\n \n22.7 \nRatios to total premiums:\nTotal benefits and claims\n46.8\n \n%\n42.8 \n%\nAdjusted expenses:\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs\n9.1\n \n8.6 \n•\nIn 2024, the total benefits and claims to total premiums ratio increased primarily due to the decrease in reserve remeasurement gains related to assumption updates in the third quarter of 2024 as well as higher incurred claims.\n•\nThe total adjusted expense ratio decreased in 2024 primarily due to expense efficiency efforts. \n•\nIn total, the pretax adjusted profit margin decreased in 2024 primarily due to the increase in total benefits and claims partially offset by higher total adjusted revenues and lower total adjusted expenses.\nThe following table presents premium persistency for Aflac U.S. on a 12-month rolling basis as of December 31.\n2024\n2023\nPremium persistency\n79.3\n \n%\n78.6 \n%\nAflac U.S. Sales\nThe following table presents Aflac's U.S. new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31.\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nNew annualized premium sales\n$\n1,543\n \n$\n1,558 \nIncrease (decrease) over prior period\n(1.0)\n%\n5.0 \n%\nThe decrease in new annualized premium sales for Aflac U.S. in 2024 primarily reflects lower sales of group voluntary benefit products impacted by a continued focus on profitable growth, as well as softer sales of network dental.\n    \n49\nItem 7.

Tax credits on these investments of $164 and $334 in 2024 and 2023, respectively, have been recorded as an income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of earnings. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these investments.\n51\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nIn 2024, operating results compared to the previous year were as follows:\n•\nNet earned premiums increased primarily due to higher reinsurance activity resulting from agreements established in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2023. \n•\nAdjusted net investment income increased primarily due to $178 million from a lower volume of federal historic rehabilitation and solar tax credit investments, with offsetting tax benefits recognized as a corresponding lower income tax expense, and higher Aflac Re consolidated investment income of $68 million primarily due to a higher volume of assets as part of the reinsurance agreements established in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2023. \n•\nTotal adjusted revenues increased primarily due to higher net earned premiums and higher adjusted net investment income.\n•\nTotal benefits and claims decreased primarily due to the impact of $163 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to a novation agreement under which Aflac Re assumed the duties, obligations and liabilities through a reinsurance of business ALIJ previously ceded to an external reinsurer, which was partially offset by higher benefits from the reinsurance agreements established in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2023.\n•\nTotal adjusted expenses increased primarily due to the higher reinsurance activity of $137 million and higher interest expense of $12 million.\n•\nPretax adjusted earnings increased primarily due to higher total adjusted revenues and lower total benefits and claims partially offset by higher total adjusted expenses.\nThe Parent Company invests in partnerships that specialize in rehabilitating historic structures or the installation of solar equipment in order to receive federal historic rehabilitation and solar tax credits. These investments are classified as limited partnerships and included in other investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in value of each investment is recorded as a reduction to net investment income. Tax credits generated by these investments are recorded as an income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of earnings. \nINVESTMENTS\nThe Company’s investment strategy utilizes disciplined asset and liability management while seeking long-term risk-adjusted investment returns and the delivery of stable income within regulatory and capital objectives, and preserving shareholder value. In attempting to optimally balance these objectives, the Company seeks to maintain on behalf of Aflac Japan a diversified portfolio of yen-denominated investment assets, a U.S. dollar-denominated investment portfolio hedged back to yen and a portfolio of unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated assets. As part of the Company's portfolio management and asset allocation process, Aflac U.S. invests in fixed maturity investments and growth assets, including public equity securities and alternative investments in limited partnerships. Aflac U.S. invests in both publicly traded and privately originated investment-grade and below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities and loans.  \nFor additional information concerning the Company's investments, see Notes 3, 4, and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n52\nItem 7.

The Company's TRE and CML investments are collateralized by commercial real estate, including some office properties. The Company considers these investments to be well diversified by geography and among property types. Further, the Company believes that the portfolio is generally well positioned with exposures concentrated in high quality underlying properties with institutional investors who are experienced in managing their assets during periods of market volatility.\nWhile generally resilient, the Company's investments in TREs and CMLs have been affected by conditions in the commercial real estate market, with a greater impact on mortgages secured by office properties. The Company invested in certain TREs and CMLs that are currently in default of interest or maturity payments. The Company works with the affected borrowers to resolve specific situations through loan continuance with potential modifications, through loan sales, or through the process of foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure. Since the third quarter of 2023, the Company has taken possession, through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, of certain commercial real estate properties, which secured defaulted loans. Properties acquired by the Company through foreclosure and deed in lieu of foreclosure are reported as real estate owned (REO) in other investments in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. \nIn 2024, the Company completed foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure on TREs collateralized with commercial real estate properties with an amortized cost of $502 million. As a result of the amortized cost of the TREs exceeding the estimated fair value of the collateral upon consummating the foreclosures or deed in lieu of foreclosure transactions, the Company recognized a net loss of $34 million in net investment gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2024. In 2023, the Company completed foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure on TREs collateralized with commercial real estate properties with an amortized cost of $284 million. As a result of the amortized cost of the TREs exceeding the estimated fair value of the collateral upon consummating the foreclosures or deed in lieu of foreclosure transactions, the Company recognized a net loss of $66 million in net investment gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n54\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nThe Company utilizes third-party asset managers to source, underwrite and manage each loan, as well as any resulting REO. The Company closely monitors the activities of these managers. In the event that a loan workout is necessary, the Company believes these external managers have the experience and resources to manage the process to maximize recovery.\nThe Company also monitors its commercial mortgage and other loan investments internally on an ongoing basis, including a review of loans' credit quality indicators and payment status as current, past due, restructured or under foreclosure. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning credit quality indicators, information on loans that are on nonaccrual status, and REO obtained through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure. See also Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risk factors associated with the Company's investments.\nThe ratings of the Company's securities referenced in the table below are based on the ratings designations provided by major rating organizations such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch or, if not rated, are determined based on the Company's internal analysis of such securities. When the ratings issued by the rating agencies differ, the Company utilizes the second lowest rating when three or more rating agency ratings are available or the lowest rating when only two rating agency ratings are available. \nThe distributions of fixed maturity securities the Company owns, by credit rating, as of December 31 were as follows:\nComposition of Fixed Maturity Securities by Credit Rating\n  \n2024\n2023\n \nAmortized\nCost\n  Fair    \n  Value    \nAmortized\nCost\n  Fair    \n  Value    \nAAA\n1.5\n \n%\n1.5\n \n%\n1.6 \n%\n1.6 \n%\nAA\n6.0\n \n6.3\n \n5.7 \n5.9 \nA\n68.0\n \n66.1\n \n68.1 \n67.2 \nBBB\n22.9\n \n24.4\n \n22.9 \n23.5 \nBB or lower\n1.6\n \n1.7\n \n1.7 \n1.8 \nTotal\n100.0\n \n%\n100.0\n \n%\n100.0 \n%\n100.0 \n%\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's direct and indirect exposure to securities in its investment portfolio that were guaranteed by third parties was immaterial both individually and in the aggregate.\nThe following table presents the 10 largest unrealized loss positions in the Company's portfolio as of December 31, 2024.\n(In millions)\nCredit\nRating\nAmortized\nCost\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized Loss \nJapan National Government\nA+\n$\n33,822 \n$\n32,844 \n$\n(978)\nUrban Renaissance Agency\nA+\n154 \n114 \n(40)\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines\nB+\n126 \n90 \n(36)\nJP Morgan Chase and Co.\nA-\n186 \n156 \n(30)\nBanco de Chile\nA\n126 \n103 \n(23)\nPrologis LP\nA-\n143 \n121 \n(22)\nSNCF Reseau\nAA-\n68 \n46 \n(22)\nTokyo Gas Co Ltd\nA+\n95 \n74 \n(21)\nWest Japan Railway Company\nA+\n66 \n46 \n(20)\nMitsui Fudosan Co.

See the Unrealized Investment Gains and Losses section in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of unrealized losses related to financial institutions and other corporate investments.\n55\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nBelow-Investment-Grade Securities\nThe Company's portfolio of below-investment-grade securities includes debt securities purchased while the issuer was rated investment grade plus other loans and bonds invested in as part of an allocation to that segment of the market.

Most of these securities were rated below-investment-grade at the time of purchase, but the Company also purchased several that were rated investment grade which, because of market pricing, offer yields commensurate with below-investment-grade risk profiles. The objective of this allocation was to enhance the Company's yield on invested assets and further diversify credit risk. All investments in this program must have a minimum rating at purchase of low BB using the Company's above described rating methodology and are managed by the Company's internal credit portfolio management team.\nThe Company invests in middle market loans primarily to U.S. corporate borrowers, most of which have below-investment-grade ratings. The objectives of this program include enhancing the yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates and hedge costs through the acquisition of floating rate assets. \n56\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nFixed Maturity Securities by Sector\nThe Company maintains diversification in investments by sector to avoid concentrations to any one sector, thus managing exposure risk.

These securities are generally either privately negotiated arrangements or issued under medium-term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings of the issuer, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and/or event-risk covenants were required. Many of these investments have protective covenants appropriate to the specific investment. These may include a prohibition of certain activities by the borrower, maintenance of certain financial measures, and specific conditions impacting the payment of the Company's notes.\nHEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company uses derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. The Company uses various strategies, including derivatives, to manage these risks. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information about market risk and the Company’s use of derivatives.\nDerivatives are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while minimizing the impact on financial results. The Company’s derivatives programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for:\n•\nA description of the Company's derivatives, hedging strategies and underlying risk exposure.\n•\nInformation about the notional amount and fair market value of the Company's derivatives.\n•\nImpact on earnings and other comprehensive income (loss) from various qualifying and non-qualifying hedging relationships.\n58\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Hedge Program\nThe Company has deployed the following hedging strategies to mitigate exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk:\n•\nAflac Japan hedges U.S. dollar-denominated investments back to yen (see \nAflac Japan’s U.S. Dollar-Denominated Hedge Program \nbelow).\n•\nAflac Japan maintains certain unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of the Company's investment in Aflac Japan, while utilizing foreign currency options to mitigate against significant movements in the yen/U.S. dollar exchange rate (see \nAflac Japan’s U.S. Dollar-Denominated Hedge Program \nbelow).\n•\nThe Parent Company designates yen-denominated liabilities (notes payable and loans) as non-derivative hedging instruments and designates certain foreign currency forwards and options as derivative hedges of the Company’s net investment in Aflac Japan \n(\nsee \nEnterprise Corporate Hedging Program \nbelow)\n.\n•\nThe Parent Company enters into forward and option contracts to accomplish a dual objective of hedging foreign currency exchange rate risk related to dividend payments by its subsidiary, ALIJ, and reducing enterprise-wide hedge costs \n(\nsee \nEnterprise Corporate Hedging Program \nbelow\n).\nThe following table presents metrics related to Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-denominated hedge program and the Parent Company's enterprise corporate hedging program, including associated amortized hedge costs/income, for the years ended December 31.

Amortized hedge costs/income have fluctuated in recent periods due to changes in the previously mentioned factors.\nAflac Japan’s U.S. Dollar-Denominated Hedge Program (U.S. Dollar Program)\nAflac Japan buys U.S. dollar-denominated investments, typically corporate bonds, and hedges them back to yen with foreign currency forwards and options to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk. This economically creates yen assets that match yen liabilities during the life of the derivative and provides favorable capital treatment under the Japan SMR calculations. The currency risk being hedged is generally based on fair value of hedged investments. The following table summarizes the U.S. dollar-denominated investments held by Aflac Japan as of December 31.\n59\nItem 7.

The Company uses one-sided foreign currency put options to mitigate the settlement risk on U.S. dollar-denominated assets related to extreme foreign currency rate changes. From time to time, Aflac Japan also maintains a collar program on a portion of its U.S. Dollar Program to mitigate against more extreme moves in foreign exchange and therefore support SMR. As of December 31, 2024, none of the Company's foreign currency options hedging Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-denominated assets were in-the-money. \nForeign exchange derivatives used for hedging are periodically settled, which results in cash receipt or payment at maturity or early termination. The following table presents the settlements associated with the Company's currency derivatives used for hedging Aflac Japan’s U.S. dollar-denominated investments for the years ended December 31.\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet cash inflows (outflows)\n$\n(508)\n$\n(598)\nEnterprise Corporate Hedging Program\nThe Company has designated certain yen-denominated liabilities and foreign currency forwards and options of the Parent Company as accounting hedges of its net investment in Aflac Japan. The Company's consolidated yen-denominated net asset position was partially hedged at $5.9 billion as of December 31, 2024, with hedging instruments comprised of $4.1 billion of yen-denominated debt and $1.8 billion of foreign currency forwards, compared with $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2023, with hedging instruments comprised of $3.7 billion of yen-denominated debt and $3.1 billion of foreign currency forwards and options.\nThe Company makes its accounting designation of net investment hedge at the beginning of each quarter. If the total of the designated Parent Company non-derivative and derivative notional is equal to or less than the Company's net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective, and the currency exchange effect on the yen-denominated liabilities and the change in estimated fair value of the derivatives are reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. The Company's net investment hedge was effective during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For additional information on the Company's net investment hedging strategy, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn order to economically mitigate risks associated with the enterprise-wide exposure to the yen and the level and volatility of hedge costs, the Parent Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts. By buying U.S. dollars and selling yen, the Parent Company is effectively lowering its overall economic exposure to the yen. In addition to reducing yen exposure from dividend payments by Aflac Japan to the Parent Company, this strategy also reduces enterprise-wide hedge costs. This activity is reported in Corporate and other. The Company continually evaluates the program’s efficacy. \n60\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nAs part of the Company’s internal reinsurance platform, Aflac Re enters into foreign currency forwards with the Parent Company, and may enter into such forwards with third parties, to economically manage the currency mismatch between Aflac Re's assets, which are mostly denominated in U.S. dollars, and liabilities, which are mostly denominated in yen, in order to support and optimize BMA capital requirements. For additional information on the Company's internal reinsurance platform, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A.\nInterest Rate Risk Hedge Program\nAflac Japan and Aflac U.S. use interest rate swaps from time to time to mitigate the risk of investment income volatility for certain variable-rate investments. Additionally, to manage interest rate risk associated with its U.S. dollar-denominated investments held by Aflac Japan, from time to time the Company utilizes interest rate swaptions.  \nFor additional discussion of the risks associated with the foreign currency exposure refer to the Currency Risk section in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and Item 1A. specifically to the Risk Factors titled “The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate“ and “Lack of availability of acceptable yen-denominated investments could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\" \nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's hedging activities.\nPOLICY LIABILITIES\nThe following table presents policy liabilities by segment and in total for the years ended December 31.\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nJapan segment:\nFuture policy benefits\n$\n60,885\n \n$\n73,638 \nOther policy liabilities\n6,664\n \n7,529 \nTotal Japan policy liabilities\n67,549\n \n81,167 \nU.S. segment:\nFuture policy benefits\n10,584\n \n11,234 \nOther policy liabilities\n479\n \n365 \nTotal U.S. policy liabilities\n11,063\n \n11,600 \nConsolidated:\nFuture policy benefits\n70,381\n \n83,718 \nOther policy liabilities\n7,127\n \n7,881 \nTotal consolidated policy liabilities \n(1)\n$\n77,508\n \n$\n91,599 \n(1) \nThe sum of the Japan and U.S. segments exceeds the total due to reinsurance and retrocession activity. \nSee Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's policy liabilities.\nBENEFIT PLANS\nAflac Japan and Aflac U.S. have various benefit plans. For additional information on the Company's Japanese and U.S. plans, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n61\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nPOLICYHOLDER PROTECTION\nPolicyholder Protection Corporation\nThe Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. Legislation enacted regarding the framework of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC) included government fiscal measures supporting the LIPPC. In March 2022, Japan's Diet passed legislation that extended the government's fiscal support of the LIPPC through March 2027. In March 2022, the LIPPC reached the required balance for the total life industry of ¥400 billion as specified by its Articles of Incorporation. As a result, additional contributions are not expected to be required unless the balance is reduced due to payments made by the LIPPC to the policyholders of insolvent insurers. Accordingly, Aflac Japan did not recognize an expense for LIPPC assessments for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nGuaranty Fund Assessments\nUnder U.S. state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. The amount of the guaranty fund assessment that an insurer is assessed is based on its proportionate share of premiums in that state. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on guaranty fund assessments. Guaranty fund assessments for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were immaterial.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the Company. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of the businesses, fund business growth and provide for an ability to withstand adverse circumstances. Financial leverage (leverage) refers to a strategy of utilizing debt in managing the Company's capital structure and cost of capital. The Company targets and actively manages liquidity, capital and leverage in the context of a number of considerations, including:\n•\nbusiness investment and growth needs \n•\nstrategic growth objectives \n•\nfinancial flexibility and obligations\n•\ncapital support for hedging activity \n•\na constantly evolving business and economic environment \n•\na balanced approach to capital allocation and shareholder deployment. \nThe governance framework supporting liquidity, capital, and leverage includes global senior management and board committees that review and approve all significant capital related decisions.\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents include unrestricted cash on hand, money market instruments, and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased, all of which have minimal market, settlement or other risk exposure. The target minimum amount for the Parent Company’s cash and cash equivalents is approximately $1.8 billion to provide a capital buffer and liquidity support at the holding company. The Company remains committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. At December 31, 2024, the Company held $6.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents for stress conditions, which includes the Parent Company's target minimum amount of $1.8 billion. \nAflac Japan and Aflac U.S. generate cash flows from their operations and provide the primary sources of liquidity to the Parent Company through management fees and dividends, with Aflac Japan being the largest contributor. The primary uses of cash by the Parent Company are shareholder dividends, the repurchase of its common stock, interest on its outstanding indebtedness and operating expenses.\n The following table presents the amounts provided to the Parent Company for the years ended December 31.\nLiquidity Provided by Subsidiaries to Parent Company\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nManagement fees paid by subsidiaries\n$\n163\n \n$\n151 \nDividends declared or paid by subsidiaries\n3,841\n \n3,516 \n62\nItem 7.

Further, the Company plans to continue to maintain a population of unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated investments at Aflac Japan and to consider whether the amount of such investments should be increased or decreased relative to the Company’s view of economic equity surplus in Aflac Japan in light of potentially rising hedge costs and other factors. See the Hedging Activities subsection of this MD&A for additional information.  \nThe Company believes that its balance of cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy both its short-term and long-term cash requirements and plans for cash, including material cash requirements from known contractual obligations and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. \nIn addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Company also maintains credit facilities, both intercompany and with external partners, and a number of other available tools to support liquidity needs on a global basis. In September 2024, the Parent Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows the Company to issue an indefinite amount of debt securities, in one or more series, from time to time until September 2027. The Company believes outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available. The Company was in compliance with all of the covenants of its notes payable and lines of credit at December 31, 2024. For additional information, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nAs part of enterprise-wide capital management and optimization, the Company also utilizes the intercompany reinsurance platform to execute internal reinsurance transactions with Aflac Re. For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table presents the estimated payments of the Company's material cash requirements from known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024.

Therefore, the sum of the cash outflows exceeds the corresponding liability amount. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, actual cash outflow amounts and timing will differ, possibly materially, from these estimates.\n(3) \nThese cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and, as a result, the sum of the cash outflows exceeds the corresponding liability amount. \n63\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nFor additional information on the Company's major contractual obligations, see the applicable Note in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as indicated in the line items in the table above.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements convey its financing arrangements during the periods presented. The Company has not engaged in material intra-period short-term financings during the periods presented that are not otherwise reported in its balance sheet or disclosed therein. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. The Company has not entered into transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase financial assets that have been accounted for as a sale under applicable accounting standards, including securities lending transactions. See Notes 1, 3, and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's securities lending and derivative activities. With the exception of disclosed activities in those referenced footnotes and the Risk Factors entitled, \"The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate\" and \"Lack of availability of acceptable yen-denominated investments could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity,\" the Company is not aware of any trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that would reasonably result in its liquidity increasing or decreasing by a material amount.\nConsolidated Cash Flows\nThe Company consistently generates positive cash flows from operations, and has the ability to adjust cash flow management from other sources of liquidity including reinvestment cash flows and selling investments in order to meet short-term cash needs.\nThe Company translates cash flows for Aflac Japan's yen-denominated items into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. In years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. \nThe following table summarizes consolidated cash flows by activity for the years ended December 31.\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nOperating activities\n$\n2,707\n \n$\n3,190 \nInvesting activities\n2,781\n \n817 \nFinancing activities\n(3,486)\n(3,723)\nExchange effect on cash and cash equivalents\n(79)\n79 \nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,923\n \n$\n363 \nOperating Activities\nThe principal cash inflows for the Company's insurance activities come from insurance premiums and investment income. The principal cash outflows are the result of policy claims, operating expenses, income tax, as well as interest expense. As a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. Therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. \nThe Company expects its future cash flows from premiums and investment portfolios to be sufficient to meet its cash needs for benefits and expenses. Consolidated cash flow from operations decreased 15.1% in 2024, compared with 2023.\n64\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nInvesting Activities\nThe Company's investment objectives provide for liquidity primarily through the purchase of publicly traded investment-grade debt securities. Prudent portfolio management dictates that the Company attempts to match the duration of its assets with the duration of its liabilities. Currently, when the Company's fixed maturity securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, the long-term nature of the Company's business and its strong cash flows provide the Company with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and/or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. From time to time or when market opportunities arise, the Company disposes of selected fixed maturity securities that are available-for-sale to improve the duration matching of assets and liabilities, improve future investment yields, and/or rebalance its portfolio. As a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year.\nAs part of its overall corporate strategy, the Company has committed up to $400 million to Aflac Ventures, LLC (Aflac Ventures), as opportunities emerge. As of December 31, 2024, of the $400 million committed, approximately $285 million has been deployed. Aflac Ventures is a subsidiary of Aflac Global Ventures, LLC (Aflac Global Ventures) which is reported in Corporate and other. The central mission of Aflac Global Ventures is to support the organic growth and business development needs of Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. with an emphasis on digital applications designed to improve the customer experience, gain efficiencies, and develop new markets in an effort to enhance and defend long-term shareholder value. Investments are included in equity securities or the other investments line in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs part of an arrangement with Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB), Aflac U.S. obtains low-cost investment funding from FHLB supported by acceptable forms of collateral pledged by Aflac U.S. In 2024, Aflac U.S. borrowed and repaid $466 million under this program. As of December 31, 2024, Aflac U.S. had outstanding borrowings of $589 million reported in its balance sheet.\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on certain investment commitments.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and from time to time debt issuances and redemptions.\nIn April 2024, ALIJ redeemed ¥30.0 billion of its .963% subordinated bonds due April 2049.\nIn March 2024, the Parent Company issued five series of senior notes totaling ¥75.0 billion through a private placement. The first series, which totaled ¥18.3 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.600% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in March 2034. The second series, which totaled ¥15.0 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.740% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in March 2036. The third series, which totaled ¥16.5 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.920% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in March 2039. The fourth series, which totaled ¥5.7 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.160% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in March 2044. The fifth series, which totaled ¥19.5 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.400% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in March 2054. These notes are redeemable at the Parent Company's option (i) in whole at any time or (ii) in part from time to time in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the notes to be redeemed.\nIn March 2024, the Parent Company issued three series of senior notes totaling ¥48.6 billion through a public debt offering under its U.S. shelf registration statement. The first series, which totaled ¥13.0 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.048% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in March 2029. The second series, which totaled ¥27.9 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.412% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in March 2031. The third series, which totaled ¥7.7 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.682% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in March 2034. These notes are redeemable at the Parent Company’s option at any time, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain changes affecting U.S. taxation, as specified in the indenture governing the terms of the issuance. In addition, the notes maturing in March 2029, March 2031 and March 2034 are redeemable at the Parent Company's option, in whole or in part from time to time, on or after December 21, 2028, December 31, 2030 and September 21, 2033, respectively, at a redemption price equal to the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be redeemed to, but excluding, the date of redemption.\n65\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nIn December 2023, ALIJ issued ¥30.0 billion (par value) of subordinated bonds that will mature in December 2053. The bonds bear interest at an initial rate of 1.958% per annum until December 5, 2028. Thereafter, the rate of interest of the bonds will be reset every five years to a rate of interest equal to the then-current five-year JGB rate plus (i) 1.650% per annum on and after the day immediately following December 5, 2028 to December 5, 2033, and (ii) 2.650% per annum on and after the day immediately following December 5, 2033 to December 5, 2053. The bonds are redeemable, in whole but not in part, (i) at any time upon the occurrence of certain regulatory or tax events, as specified in the indenture governing the terms of the bonds or (ii) on each interest rate reset date on or after December 5, 2028.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the debt issuances discussed above.\nCash returned to shareholders through treasury stock purchases and dividends was $3.9 billion in 2024, compared with $3.8 billion in 2023.\nThe following tables present a summary of treasury stock activity during the years ended December 31.\nTreasury Stock Purchased\n(In millions of dollars and thousands of shares)\n2024\n2023\nTreasury stock purchases\n$\n2,800\n \n$\n2,801 \nNumber of shares purchased:\nShare repurchase program\n30,428\n \n38,896 \nOther\n494\n \n364 \n   Total shares purchased\n30,922\n \n39,260 \nTreasury Stock Issued\n(In millions of dollars and thousands of shares)\n2024\n2023\nStock issued from treasury:\n   Cash financing\n$\n14\n \n$\n17 \n   Noncash financing\n67\n \n59 \n   Total stock issued from treasury\n$\n81\n \n$\n76 \nNumber of shares issued\n1,042\n \n1,164 \nAs of December 31, 2024, a remaining balance of 47.3 million shares of the Company's common stock was available for purchase under share repurchase authorizations by its board of directors. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCash dividends paid to shareholders in 2024 of $2.00 per share increased 19.0% over 2023.

The first quarter 2025 cash dividend of $.58 per share is payable on March 3, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 19, 2025.\n66\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nRegulatory Restrictions\nAflac Japan\nAflac Japan is required to meet certain financial criteria as governed by the Companies Act of Japan in order to provide dividends to the Parent Company. Under these criteria, dividend capacity at Aflac Japan is defined as total equity excluding common stock and capital reserves (representing statutorily required amounts in Japan) but reduced for net after-tax unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities. These dividend capacity requirements are generally aligned with the SMR. Japan's FSA maintains its own solvency standard which is quantified through the SMR. Aflac Japan's SMR is sensitive to interest rate, credit spread, and foreign exchange rate changes; therefore, the Company continues to evaluate alternatives for reducing this sensitivity, including the reduction of subsidiary dividends paid to the Parent Company and Parent Company capital contributions. In the event of a rapid change in market risk conditions causing SMR to decline, the Company has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of ¥100 billion as a capital contingency plan. Additionally, subject to market conditions, the Company expects that it could take action to enter into derivatives on unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated investments with foreign currency options or forwards or execute additional reinsurance transactions. See Notes 8 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Company has already undertaken various measures to mitigate the sensitivity of Aflac Japan's SMR. For example, the Company employs policy reserve matching (PRM) investment strategies, which is a Japan-specific accounting treatment that reduces SMR interest rate sensitivity since PRM-designated investments are carried at amortized cost consistent with corresponding liabilities. In order for a PRM-designated asset to be held at amortized cost, there are certain criteria that must be maintained. The primary criterion relates to maintaining the duration of designated assets and liabilities within a specified tolerance range. If the duration difference is not maintained within the specified range without rebalancing, then a certain portion of the assets must be reclassified as available-for-sale and held at fair value with any associated unrealized gain or loss recorded in surplus. To rebalance, assets may need to be sold in order to maintain the duration with the specified range, resulting in realizing a gain or loss from the sale. For U.S. GAAP, PRM investments are categorized as available-for-sale. The Company also uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge a portion of its U.S. dollar-denominated investments.\n \nSee Notes 3, 4 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's investment strategies, hedging activities, and reinsurance, respectively. \nAflac Japan's SMR remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. As of December 31, 2024, Aflac Japan's SMR was 1,221%, compared with 1,219% at December 31, 2023. The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels, consistent with maintaining current insurance financial strength and credit ratings.  \nThe FSA will introduce an economic value-based solvency regime based on the Insurance Capital Standards (ICS) for insurance companies in Japan. The final specifications were published in May 2024 with the new capital regime and initial ESR report becoming effective for Aflac Japan's 2025 fiscal year. \nAs of December 31, 2024, Aflac Japan's estimated ESR was above 270%.\nAflac U.S.\nA life insurance company’s statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the NAIC, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from U.S. GAAP and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. The continued long-term growth of the Company's business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of its insurance operations. The Company's insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings, reduced dividends paid to the Parent Company, capital contributions by the Parent Company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings, or reinsurance transactions. The NAIC’s RBC formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies. The RBC formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer’s operations.\nThe combined RBC ratio for Aflac U.S. as of December 31, 2024 was 677%, compared with 710% as of December 31, 2023. The Company calculates its combined RBC ratio to include all U.S. regulated life insurance entities as if a single combined U.S. RBC entity net of intercompany items related to capital resources and risk. \nThe table below presents RBC ratios for the Company’s U.S. life insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, the most recent statutory fiscal year-end for the subsidiaries for which RBC was filed. \n67\nItem 7.

The SMI focused on key issues such as capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, reinsurance, statutory accounting and financial reporting matters. The NAIC still has some ongoing initiatives related to SMI, such as monitoring the international efforts on group capital requirements as well as RBC. The NAIC utilizes a group capital calculation (GCC) that conceptually uses an RBC aggregation methodology for all entities within the insurance company holding system. The GCC is intended to be a regulatory tool used by regulators as a means to standardize group capital requirements.\nAflac, CAIC and TOIC are domiciled in Nebraska and are subject to its regulations. The NDOI imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances to the Parent Company. Under Nebraska insurance law, prior approval of the NDOI is required for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. Dividends declared by Aflac during 2025 in excess of $912 million would be considered extraordinary and require such approval. Similar laws apply in New York, the domiciliary jurisdiction of Aflac New York.\nCorporate and Other\nAflac Re is licensed by the BMA as a long-term insurer and is subject to the Bermuda Insurance Act of 1978 (Bermuda Insurance Act). Aflac Re is required to file an annual return for its Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR) which utilizes an Economic Balance Sheet (EBS) framework to determine Aflac Re’s Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR). Aflac Re is also subject to a Minimum Margin of Solvency (MMS) related to its statutory financial statements. The MMS is equal to the greater of $500,000, 1.5% of the total statutory assets, or 25% of ECR.\nUnder the EBS framework, Aflac Re is required to value assets equal to U.S. GAAP fair values, and insurance reserves are valued using technical provisions which consist of a best estimate liability plus a risk margin. The best estimate liability can be calculated by applying the standard approach or, with regulatory approval, the scenario-based approach. The standard approach uses discount rates for insurance reserves as prescribed by the BMA. The scenario-based approach uses a discount rate based on the yield of eligible assets owned by the insurer as determined using a series of prescribed stress scenarios. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Aflac Re was in compliance with the ECR and MMS requirements.\nUnder the Bermuda Insurance Act, Aflac Re is prohibited from paying dividends in an amount that exceeds 25% of the prior year's statutory capital and surplus without an affidavit stating that Aflac Re will continue to meet its solvency margin. Further, Aflac Re may not reduce its total statutory capital by 15% or more without prior regulatory approval. Additionally, Aflac Re is not permitted to pay any dividends that would cause Aflac Re to fail to meet its minimum capital requirements.\nOther\nFor information regarding commitments and contingent liabilities, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdditional Information\nInvestors should note that the Company announces material financial information in its SEC filings, press releases and public conference calls. In accordance with SEC guidance, the Company may also use the Investor Relations section of the Company's website (http://investors.aflac.com) to communicate with investors about the Company. It is possible that the financial and other information the Company posts there could be deemed to be material information. The information on the Company's website is not part of this document. Further, the Company's references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\n68\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles are established primarily by the FASB. In this MD&A, references to U.S. GAAP issued by the FASB are derived from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification™ (ASC). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. The estimates that the Company deems to be most critical to an understanding of its results of operations and financial condition are those related to the valuation of investments and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), liabilities for future policy benefits, and income taxes. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management’s analyses and judgments. Calculations of DAC and the LFPB require the use of estimates based on actuarial valuation techniques. The application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 92% of the Company's assets and 78% of its liabilities are reported as of December 31, 2024, and thus has a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders' equity. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.\nValuation of Investments, Including Derivatives\nThe Company's investments, primarily consisting of debt and equity securities, include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. For publicly issued securities, the Company determines the fair values from quoted market prices readily available from public exchange markets and price quotes and valuations from third-party pricing vendors. For the majority of privately issued securities and derivatives associated with VIEs within the Company's investment portfolio, a third-party pricing vendor has developed valuation models that the Company utilizes to determine fair values. These models and associated processes and controls are executed by Company personnel. For the remaining privately issued securities, the Company uses non-binding price quotes from outside brokers. The Company's valuation model for private placements explicitly incorporates currency basis swap adjustments (market observable data) to assumed interest rate curves where appropriate.\nThe Company estimates the fair values of its securities on a monthly basis. The Company monitors the estimated fair values obtained from its pricing vendors and brokers for consistency from month to month, while considering current market conditions. The Company also periodically discusses with its pricing brokers and vendors the pricing techniques they use to monitor the consistency of their approach and periodically assess the appropriateness of the valuation level assigned to the values obtained from them. If a fair value appears unreasonable, the Company will re-examine the inputs and assess the reasonableness of the pricing data with the vendor. Additionally, the Company may compare the inputs to relevant market indices and other performance measurements. Based on management's analysis, the valuation is confirmed or may be revised if there is evidence of a more appropriate estimate of fair value based on available market data. The Company has performed verification of the inputs and calculations in any valuation models to confirm that the valuations represent reasonable estimates of fair value. Inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency forward and spot rates, foreign currency volatility, and interest rate volatility.\nThe Company estimates an expected lifetime credit loss on investments measured at amortized cost including held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities, loan receivables and certain loan commitments on a quarterly basis. For the Company’s available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, the Company evaluates estimated credit losses only when the fair value of the available-for-sale fixed maturity security is below its amortized cost basis\nThe Company’s approach to estimating credit losses is complex and incorporates significant judgments. In addition to a security, an asset class, or issuer-specific credit fundamentals, it considers past events, current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The Company's estimates are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nSee the tabular disclosure entitled \"Sensitivity of Fair Values of Financial Instruments to Interest Rate Change\" in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n69\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Liability for Future Policy Benefits\nThe majority of the supplemental health and life insurance policies the Company issues are classified as long-duration contracts. The contract provisions generally cannot be changed or canceled during the contract period; however, the Company may adjust premiums for supplemental health policies issued in the U.S. within prescribed guidelines and with the approval of state insurance regulatory authorities.\nInsurance premiums for most of the Company's health and life policies, including cancer, accident, hospital, critical illness, supplemental dental and vision, term life, whole life, long-term care and disability, are recognized as earned premiums over the premium-paying periods of the contracts when due from policyholders. When earned premiums are reported, the related amounts of benefits and expenses are charged against such revenues. This association is accomplished by means of annual increases or decreases to the LFPB and the deferral and subsequent amortization of policy acquisition costs.\nPremiums from the Company's products with limited-pay features, including cancer, medical and nursing care, term life, whole life, WAYS, and child endowment, are collected over a significantly shorter period than the contract term (i.e., the period during which benefits are provided). Premiums for these products are recognized as earned premiums over the premium-paying periods when due from policyholders. Any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recorded as a deferred profit liability, a component of the LFPB, which is subsequently amortized in net earned premiums such that profits are recognized in a constant relationship with insurance in force. Benefits are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. An LFPB is recorded when premiums are recognized using the net premium method.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of DAC is computed using the same contract groupings (also referred to as cohorts) and mortality and termination assumptions that are used in computing the LFPB and these assumptions are reviewed and updated at least annually. The effects of changes in assumptions are recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term as a revision of the future amortization pattern, while current period amortization is calculated based on the actual experience during the quarter. For additional information, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nThe Company's LFPB is determined in accordance with applicable guidelines as defined under U.S. GAAP and Actuarial Standards of Practice and represent claims that are expected to occur in the future and already incurred claims (which represent claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to the Company) and are measured using the net level premium method. Future policy benefits are calculated using assumptions and estimates including mortality, morbidity, termination (also referred to as lapses), expense, and discount rates. The assumptions and estimates that the Company uses depend on its judgment regarding the likelihood of future events and are inherently uncertain. \nCash flow assumptions (mortality, morbidity, and termination) are established at policy inception and are evaluated each quarter to determine if an update is needed. To facilitate a more detailed review of cash flow assumptions, experience studies are performed annually during the third quarter. Changes in cash flow assumptions are recognized in reserve remeasurement (gains) losses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Expense assumptions are established at policy inception and are not updated. Actual experience is reflected in the calculation of future policy benefits each quarter, and changes in the liability due to actual experience are recognized in reserve remeasurement (gains) losses in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nDiscount rates used to calculate net premiums are locked in at policy inception and represent the basis to recognize interest expense accreted on insurance reserves in benefits and claims, excluding reserve remeasurement in the consolidated statements of earnings. Discount rates used to measure the carrying value of LFPB in the consolidated balance sheets are updated each reporting period, and the differences between the liability balances calculated using the locked-in discount rates and the updated discount rates are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The discount rate methodology is designed to prioritize observable inputs based on market data available in the local debt markets where the respective policies were issued in the currency in which the policies are denominated. For the discount rates applicable to tenors for which the single-A debt market is not liquid or there is little or no observable market data, the Company uses various estimation techniques consistent with the fair value guidance in ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurement, which include, but are not limited to: (i) for tenors where there is less observable market data and/or the observable market data is available for similar instruments, estimating tenor-specific single-A credit spreads and \n70\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \napplying them to risk-free government rates; (ii) for tenors where there is very limited or no observable single-A or similar market data, interpolation and extrapolation techniques.\nIf interest rates decreased by 100 basis points, the Company's LFPB balance as of December 31, 2024 would increase by $9.6 billion, and if interest rates increased by 100 basis points, the Company's LFPB balance as of December 31, 2024 would decrease by $7.6 billion.\nFor additional information on future policy benefits, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing the Company's income tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the Company expects the temporary differences to reverse. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with U.S. GAAP is a two-step process. Under the first step, the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The second step is measurement, whereby a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized. The determination of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. \nIn evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Company's management considers all available evidence, including taxable income in open carry back years, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, future taxable temporary difference reversals, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event the Company determines it is not more likely than not that it will be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Future economic conditions and market volatility, including increases in interest rates or widening credit spreads, can adversely impact the Company’s tax planning strategies and in particular the Company’s ability to utilize tax benefits on previously recognized capital losses. The Company's judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions. \nAn increase or decrease in the Company's effective tax rate by one percentage point would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the Company's 2024 income tax expense of $49 million.\nFor additional information on income taxes, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report. \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted LDTI employing a modified retrospective transition method, which required the amended guidance be applied as of the beginning of the earliest period presented beginning on the January 1, 2021 transition date (Transition Date). The Transition Date impact from adoption resulted in a decrease in AOCI of approximately $18.6 billion and a decrease in retained earnings of approximately $0.3 billion. \nFor information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on the Company's financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",
