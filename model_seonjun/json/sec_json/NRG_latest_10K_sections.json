  "item1": "Item 1 — Business\nGeneral\nNRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a leading energy and smart home company fueled by market-leading brands, proprietary technologies and complementary sales channels. Across the U.S. and Canada, NRG delivers innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under brand names such as NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain Energy and Vivint, while also advocating for competitive energy markets and customer choice. The Company has a customer base that includes approximately 8 million residential customers (comprised of 6 million retail energy customers and 2 million smart home customers) in addition to commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers, supported by approximately 13 GW of generation as of December 31, 2024.\nNRG sold 154\n TWhs \nof electricity and 1,833 MMDth of natural gas in 2024, making it one of the largest competitive energy retailers in the U.S. As of the end of 2024, NRG had recurring electricity and/or natural gas sales in 25 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and 8 provinces in Canada, and Vivint Smart Home served customers in all 50 U.S. states. NRG's retail brands, collectively, have the largest share of competitively served residential electric customers in Texas and is one of the largest business-to-business providers of power and natural gas in North America, including to manufacturing, industrial, and data center facilities.\nStrategy\nNRG's strategy is to maximize shareholder value by being a leader in the emerging convergence of energy and smart automation in the home and business. Through a diversified supply strategy, the Company sells reliable electricity and natural gas to its customers in the markets it serves, while also providing innovative home solutions to customers. NRG's unique combination of assets and capabilities enables the Company to develop and sell highly differentiated offerings that bring together every day essential services like powering and securing the home through a seamless and integrated experience. This strategy is intended to enable the Company to optimize its unique integrated platform to delight customers, generate recurring cash flow, significantly strengthen earnings and cost competitiveness, and lower risk and volatility. Sustainability is a philosophy that underpins NRG’s strategy and facilitates value creation across NRG's business. \nTo effectuate the Company’s strategy, NRG is focused on: (i) serving the energy needs of end-use residential, commercial and industrial, and wholesale counterparties in competitive markets and optimizing on additional revenue opportunities through its multiple brands and channels; (ii) offering a variety of energy products and smart home products and services that are differentiated by innovative features, premium service, integrated platforms, sustainability and loyalty/affinity programs; (iii) excellence in operating performance of its assets; (iv) achieving the optimal mix of supply to serve its customer load requirements through a diversified supply strategy; and (v) engaging in disciplined and transparent capital allocation. \nIn 2024, NRG entered into a definitive partnership agreement with Renew Home, a Virtual Power Plant platform (“VPP”) formed by the combination of Google’s Nest Renew and OhmConnect. Leveraging Google Cloud’s AI and cloud platforms, NRG and Renew Home plan to develop a VPP portfolio of up to 1 GW of load management capacity, with instantaneous dispatch value during peak events and tight supply conditions.\nBusiness Overview\nThe Company’s core businesses are the sale of electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial and wholesale customers, supported by the Company's wholesale electric generation, as well as the sale of smart home products and services. NRG manages its electricity and natural gas operations based on the combined results of the retail, wholesale and generation businesses with a geographical focus. Vivint Smart Home operations are reported within the Vivint Smart Home segment. \nThe Company's business is segmented as follows:\n•\nTexas, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in Texas, other than Cottonwood;\n•\nEast, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in the East; \n•\nWest/Services/Other, which primarily includes the following assets and activities: (i) all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in the West and Canada, and (ii) activity related to the Cottonwood facility and other investments; \n•\nVivint Smart Home; and\n•\nCorporate activities. \n7\n                                                     \nIn Texas, the Company’s generation supply is fully integrated with its retail load. This integrated model provides the advantage of being able to supply a portion of the Company’s retail customers with electricity from the Company’s assets, which reduces the need to sell electricity to, and buy electricity from, other institutions and intermediaries, resulting in more stable earnings and cash flows, lower transaction costs and less credit exposure. The integrated model also results in a reduction in actual and contingent collateral through offsetting transactions, thereby reducing transactions with third parties.\n \nThe integrated model consists of three core functions in each geographic segment above: Customer Operations, Market Operations and Plant Operations.\nCustomer Operations\nCustomer Operations is responsible for growing and retaining the customer base and delivering an outstanding customer experience. This includes acquisition and retention of all of NRG’s residential, small commercial, commercial and industrial, and government customers. NRG employs a multi-brand strategy that leverages a wide array of sales and partnership channels, direct face-to-face sales channels, call centers, websites, and brokers. Go-to-market activities include market strategy planning and development, product innovation, offer design, campaign execution, marketing and creative services, and selling. Customer portfolio maintenance and retention activities include fulfillment, billing, payment processing, collections, customer service, issue resolution, and contract renewals. NRG provides energy and related services at either fixed, indexed or month-to-month prices. Home customers typically contract for terms ranging from one month to five years, while Business customers typically contract for terms ranging from one year to five years in length and extended contractual terms are available. Throughout all Customer Operations activities, the customer experience is kept at the forefront to inform decision-making and optimize retention, while creating supporters and advocates for NRG’s brands in the market. Customer Operations primarily comprises two end-use customer facing teams: NRG Home, which serves residential customers, and NRG Business, which serves business customers. \nProduct Offerings\nNRG sells a variety of products to residential and small commercial customers, in a wide variety of sales channels, including retail electricity and energy management, natural gas, line and surge protection products and home protection products, repair and maintenance, and carbon offsets. Home customers make purchase decisions based on a variety of factors, including price, incentive, customer service, brand, innovative offers/features and referrals from friends and family. Through its broad range of service offerings and value propositions, NRG seeks to attract, retain, and increase the value of its customer relationships. NRG's brands are recognized for exemplary customer service, innovative smart energy and environmentally-friendly solutions. \nThe Company provides power and natural gas to the business-to-business markets in North America, as well as retail services, including demand response, commodity sales, energy efficiency and energy management solutions to Business customers. The Company is an integrated provider of supply and distributed energy resources and focuses on distributed products as businesses seek greater reliability, cleaner power and other benefits that they cannot obtain from the grid. These solutions include system power, distributed generation, renewable and low-carbon products, carbon management and specialty services, backup generation, storage and distributed solar, demand response, and energy efficiency and advisory services. \nMarket Operations\nMarket Operations has two primary objectives: to supply energy to customers in the most cost-efficient manner and to maximize the value of the Company's assets in satisfying its customer load requirements. These objectives are intended to reduce supply costs and maximize earnings with predictable cash flows.\nPower and natural gas are the two main commercial groups within Market Operations.\nPower\nThe power commercial group is responsible for end-use electricity supply including power plant optimization and certain fuel supply. To meet the market operations objectives, NRG enters into supply, power and gas hedging agreements via a wide range of products and contracts, including (i) physical and financial commodity instruments, (ii) fuel supply and transportation contracts, (iii) PPAs and Renewable PPAs, and (iv) capacity and other contracted revenue or supply sources, as further discussed below.\nIn addition, because changes in power prices in the markets where NRG operates are generally correlated to changes in natural gas prices, NRG uses hedging strategies that may include power and natural gas forward purchases and sales contracts to manage commodity price risk.\nPhysical and Financial Commodity Instruments\nNRG trades power, natural gas, environmental, weather and other physical and financial commodity related products, including forwards, futures, options and swaps. NRG enters into these instruments primarily to manage price and delivery risk, \n8\n                                                     \noptimize physical and contractual assets in the portfolio, manage working capital requirements, reduce the carbon exposure in its business and comply with laws and regulations.\nFuel Supply and Transportation Contracts\nNRG's fuel requirements consist of various forms of fossil fuel. The prices of fossil fuels can be volatile. The Company obtains its fossil fuels from multiple suppliers and through multiple transporters. Although availability is generally not an issue, localized shortages, transportation availability, delays arising from extreme weather conditions and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. The preceding factors related to the sources and availability of raw materials are fairly uniform across the Company's business and fuel products used. NRG's primary fuel requirements consist of the following:\nNatural Gas\n — NRG operates a fleet of mid-merit and peaking natural gas plants. Fuel needs are managed by the natural gas commercial group, generally on a spot basis, as the Company does not believe it is prudent to forward purchase natural gas for these types of units as the dispatch is highly unpredictable. Natural gas storage and transportation contracts are utilized to reduce daily volatility.\nCoal\n — NRG actively manages its coal requirements based on forecasted generation, market volatility and its inventory on site. The Company believes it is adequately hedged, using forward coal supply agreements, for its domestic coal consumption for 2025. As of December 31, 2024, NRG had purchased forward contracts to provide fuel for the Company's expected requirements for 2025. For the domestic fleet, NRG purchased approximately 13 million tons of coal in 2024, all of which was Powder River Basin coal. For fuel transport, NRG has entered into various rail transportation and rail car lease agreements with varying tenures, which will provide for the Company's transportation requirements of Powder River Basin coal for the next four years.\nRenewable PPAs\nThe Company's strategy is to procure mid to long-term renewable generation through power purchase agreements. NRG has entered into Renewable PPAs totaling approximately 1.9 GW with third-party project developers and other counterparties, of which all are operational as of December 31, 2024. The remaining average tenure of these agreements is nine years. The Company expects to continue evaluating and executing similar agreements that support the needs of the business. The total GW entered into through Renewable PPAs may be impacted by contract terminations when they occur.\nCapacity and Other Contracted Revenue or Supply Sources\nNRG's revenues and/or cash flows, primarily in the East and West, benefit from capacity/demand payments and other contracted revenue sources, originating from market clearing capacity prices, tolling arrangements and other long-term contractual arrangements. \nNatural Gas\nThe natural gas commercial group is responsible for costing, logistics and supply for all of NRG's residential, commercial and industrial, and wholesale customers. NRG has contractual rights to natural gas transportation and storage assets across its footprint that allow for optimal supply economics in support of its various businesses. NRG's diversified load coupled with this asset portfolio enables the Company to deliver supply economically while providing incremental optimization activities when market conditions allow. The scale of the natural gas operation extends from the wellhead (through its producer services business) to end use customers (through NRG's various sales channels). This scale, coupled with the Company's associated assets, gas system platform and people, create significant value across North America.\nPlant Operations\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company owns and leases a diversified wholesale generation portfolio with approximately 13 GW of fossil fuel, and renewable generation capacity at 18 plants. The Company's wholesale generation assets are diversified by fuel-type and dispatch level, which helps mitigate the risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles. NRG continually evaluates its generation portfolio to focus on asset optimization opportunities and the locational value of its generation assets in each of the markets where the Company participates, as well as opportunities for the development of new generation.\n9\n                                                     \nThe following table summarizes NRG's generation portfolio as of December 31, 2024:\n(In MW)\n(a)\nType\nTexas\nEast\nWest/Services/Other\n(b)\nTotal\nNatural gas\n4,353 \n80 \n1,252 \n5,685 \nCoal\n4,174 \n1,948 \n605 \n6,727 \nOil\n— \n455 \n— \n455 \nUtility Scale Solar\n— \n— \n214 \n214 \nTotal generation capacity\n8,527 \n2,483 \n2,071 \n13,081 \n(a)\nUtility Scale Solar is described in MW on an alternating current basis.

The Company follows a consistent set of operating requirements, including a solid base of training, required adherence to specific safety and environmental limits, procedure and checklist usage, and the implementation of continuous process improvement through incident investigations. \nNRG uses industry leading maintenance practices for preventive, predictive and corrective maintenance planning. The Company’s strategic planning process evaluates equipment condition, performance, and obsolescence to support the development of a comprehensive work scope and schedule for long-term performance.\nAsset Management\nNRG manages all aspects of its generation portfolio to \noptimize the lifecycle value of the assets, \nconsistent with the Company’s goals. The Company evaluates capital projects required for continued operation and strategic enhancement of the assets, \nprovides quality assurance on capital outlays, \nand assesses the impact of rules, regulations, and laws on business profitability. In addition, the Company manages its long-term contracts and real estate holdings and provides management services.\nDevelopment, Engineering & Construction\nNRG develops, engineers and executes major plant projects as well as “new build” generation and energy storage projects that enhance the value of its generation portfolio and provide options to meet generation growth needs in the retail markets it serves, in accordance with the Company’s strategic goals. These projects have included gas-fired generation development and construction, coal to gas conversions, grid scale energy storage development, grid scale renewable construction, and asset demolition, remediation and reclamation work. \nTexas Development Priorities \n— During 2024, NRG advanced progress on three new generation projects aimed at expanding its operational capacity to meet growing retail power supply needs in the ERCOT wholesale electric market. These projects include a new 415 MW peaker plant at its T.H. Wharton generating station in Texas, which is scheduled to be operational in 2026 and a new 689 MW combined cycle generating facility at its Cedar Bayou generating station in Texas, which is scheduled to be operational in 2028.\n \nBoth projects are under consideration for financing from the Texas Energy Fund. NRG continues to explore its options for the 443 MW Greens Bayou 6 project. These additions to NRG’s portfolio are strategically aligned with the Company’s commitment to meeting the growing energy needs of its customers. \nVivint Smart Home\nVivint Smart Home is a leading smart home platform that provides customers with technology, products and services to create a smarter, greener, safer home.

The Company sold its interest in STP on November 1, 2023\nCompetition\nWhile there has been consolidation in the competitive retail energy space over the past few years, there is still considerable competition for customers. In Texas, there is healthy competition in deregulated areas and customers can choose providers based on the most appealing offers. Outside of Texas, electricity retailers compete with the incumbent utilities, in addition to other retail electric providers, which can inhibit competition depending on the market rules of the state. There is a high degree of fragmentation, with both large and small competitors offering a range of value propositions, including value, rewards, and sustainability-based offerings.\nWholesale generation is highly fragmented and diverse in terms of industry structure by region. As such, there is wide variation in the capabilities, resources, nature and identities of the Company’s competitors depending on the market. Competitors include regulated utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, other independent power producers, and power marketers or trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions. \nThe smart home market is an expanding global opportunity and is in the early stages of broad consumer adoption. It is highly competitive and fragmented. Major competitors range from large-cap technology companies seeking to expand their core market opportunity who predominantly offer do-it-yourself devices that put a large burden on homeowners to self-install and support many devices, to security-based providers, as well as industrial and telecommunications companies that offer connected home experiences. Vivint Smart Home provides the full smart home experience, with an end-to-end solution that includes a wide range of unique capabilities and use cases. Currently, the vast majority of competitors do not offer comprehensive smart home solutions and accompanying services.\nSeasonality and Price Volatility\nThe sale of power and natural gas to retail customers are seasonal businesses with the demand for power generally peaking during the summer, and the demand for natural gas generally peaking during the winter. As a result, net working capital requirements for the Company's retail operations generally increase during summer and winter months along with the \n13\n                                                     \nhigher revenues, and then decline during off-peak months. Weather may impact operating results and extreme weather conditions could have a material impact. The rates charged to retail customers may be impacted by fluctuations in total power prices and market dynamics, such as the price of natural gas, transmission constraints, competitor actions, and changes in market heat rates.\nAnnual and quarterly operating results of the Company's generation portfolio can be significantly affected by weather and energy commodity price volatility. Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas, interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility. The preceding factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across the regions in which the Company operates.\nMarket Framework \nNRG sells electricity, natural gas and related products and services, and smart home products and services to customers throughout the U.S. and Canada. In most of the states and regions that have introduced retail consumer choice, NRG competitively offers electricity, natural gas and other value-enhancing services to customers. Each retail consumer choice state or province establishes its own retail competition laws and regulations, and the specific operational, licensing, and compliance requirements vary by state or province. Regulated terms and conditions of default service, as well as any movement to replace default service with competitive services, as is done in ERCOT, can affect customer participation in retail competition. In Canada, NRG sells energy and related services to residential and commercial customers in the province of Alberta pursuant both to a regulated rate service governed by provincial regulations as well as a competitive service with rates set by market forces. Sales of energy to commercial customers take place in other provinces as well. The attractiveness of NRG's retail offerings may be impacted by the rules, regulations, market structure and communication requirements from public utility commissions in each state and province.\nNRG's fleet of power plants which it owns, operates or manages are located in organized energy markets, known as RTOs or ISOs. Each organized market administers day-ahead and real-time centralized bid-based energy and ancillary services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT. These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy markets operate, how market participants make bilateral sales with one another and how entities with market-based rates are compensated. Established prices reflect the value of energy at the specific location and time it is delivered, which is known as the Locational Marginal Price. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of locational market power. These market structures facilitate NRG's sale of power and capacity products at market-based rates. \nOther than ERCOT and AESO, each of the ISO regions also operates a capacity or resource adequacy market that provides an opportunity for generating and demand response resources to earn revenues to offset their fixed costs that are not recovered in the energy and ancillary services markets. The ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations.\nTexas\n \nNRG's business in Texas is subject to standards and regulations adopted by the PUCT and ERCOT\n1\n, including the requirement for retailers to be certified by the PUCT in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity. The ERCOT market is one of the nation's largest and, historically, fastest growing power markets. ERCOT is an energy-only market. The majority of the retail load in the ERCOT market region is served by competitive retail suppliers, except certain areas that have not opted into competitive consumer choice and are served by municipal utilities and electric cooperatives. \nEast\nWhile most of the states in the East region of the U.S. have introduced some level of retail consumer choice for electricity and/or natural gas, the incumbent utilities currently provide default service in most of the states and as a result typically serve the majority of residential customers. NRG’s retail activities in the East include both direct sales to end-use customers as well as sales through municipal aggregations, both of which are subject to standards and regulations adopted by the ISOs, state public utility commissions and legislators, including the requirement for retailers to be certified in each state in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity.\n \nPower plants owned, operated or managed by NRG and NRG's demand response assets located in the East region of the U.S. are within the control areas of PJM, NYISO, ISO-NE and MISO. Each of the market regions in the East region provides for robust competition in the day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, the assets in the East region receive a significant portion of their revenues from capacity markets. PJM and ISO-NE use a forward capacity auction, while NYISO uses a month-ahead capacity auction. MISO has an annual auction. Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters, as well as additions of new capacity. PJM and ISO-NE operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time generator performance during certain system conditions. In such markets, NRG’s actual capacity revenues will be the combination of cleared auction prices times the quantity of MW cleared, plus the net of any \n1\n \nThe Cottonwood facility is located in Deweyville, Texas, but operates in the MISO market\n14\n                                                     \nover-performance \"bonus payments\" and any under-performance charges. Additionally, bidding rules allow for the incorporation of a risk premium into generator bids.\nWest\nIn the West region of the U.S., NRG is an LSE and sells electricity at retail in California’s Direct Access marketplace, as well as through community choice aggregations in the state. Additionally, NRG sells natural gas as both a retail supplier and wholesaler principally in California. NRG also owns equity interests in, operates, or manages power plants located entirely within the CAISO footprint. The CAISO operates day-ahead and real-time locational markets for energy and ancillary services, while managing congestion primarily through nodal prices. The CAISO system facilitates NRG's sale and purchase of power, ancillary services and capacity products at market-based rates, either within the CAISO's centralized energy and ancillary service markets or bilaterally. The CPUC also determines capacity requirements for LSEs and for specified local areas utilizing inputs from the CAISO. Both the CAISO and CPUC rules require LSEs to contract with sufficient generation resources in order to maintain minimum levels of generation within defined local areas. Additionally, the CAISO has independent authority to contract with needed resources under certain circumstances, typically either when LSEs have failed to procure sufficient resources, or system conditions change unexpectedly.\nCanada\nIn Canada, NRG sells to residential and commercial retail customers in Alberta, within the AESO footprint, under both regulated rates approved by the AUC as well as through competitive service. The Company's regulated rates are approved through periodic rate applications that establish rates for power and gas sales as well as for recovery of other costs associated with operating the regulated business. In addition, the Company sells energy to commercial customers in other provinces. All sales and operations are subject to applicable federal and provincial laws and regulations.\nVivint Smart Home\nVivint Smart Home operates in all states throughout the U.S. that regulate in some manner the sale, installation, servicing, monitoring or maintenance of smart home and electronic security systems. Vivint Smart Home and its sales representatives are typically required to obtain and maintain licenses, certifications or similar permits from governmental entities as a condition to engaging in the smart home and security service business. Vivint Smart Home is subject to federal and state laws related to consumer financing which may include rules related to fees and charges, disclosures and regulation of the party extending consumer credit. \nEnergy Regulatory Matters\nAs participants in wholesale and retail energy markets and owners and operators of power plants, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include the CFTC, FERC, NRC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where NRG's generation or distributed generation assets are located. In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates. Likewise, certain NRG entities participating in the retail markets are subject to rules and regulations established by the states and provinces in which NRG entities are licensed to sell at retail. NRG must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where NRG operates.\nNRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT.\nState and Provincial Energy Regulation\nMaryland Legislation \n— On May 9, 2024, Maryland Governor Wes Moore signed Senate Bill 1 into law, which restricts the competitive retail electric and natural gas market in Maryland, affecting residential customers but not commercial and industrial customers. Key provisions of the law took effect on January 1, 2025. The legislation imposes a price cap on residential contracts tied to a trailing 12-month historical average of utility rates, with only a limited exception for renewable power products. Renewable products must now have their price pre-approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission and source their renewable electricity certificates from within the PJM region. The law also requires that any variable-price contract not contain a change in price more than once a year, except time-of-use contracts, and limits contract terms to 12 months. It requires affirmative consent for the renewal of customer contracts for renewable power products. The law also imposes licensing requirements on energy salespeople. The law states that it does not impair existing contracts. On October 1, 2024, Green Mountain Energy Company, NRG’s renewable electricity provider, along with a retail trade association to which NRG belongs, filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of Senate Bill 1. On November 18, 2024, the trial court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs, including Green Mountain, have filed an appeal to this denial to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal is pending.\n15\n                                                     \nAlberta Rate of Last Resort \n— On September 27, 2024, the government of Alberta legislative assembly adopted the Rate of Last Resort Regulation to transition the regulated electricity rate from a monthly, variable rate “Regulated Rate Option” to a two-year, fixed rate “Rate of Last Resort” effective January 1, 2025. On November 29, 2024, the Alberta Utilities Commission approved a negotiated settlement between Direct Energy Regulated Services and the Utilities Consumer Advocate to establish the Rate of Last Resort price-setting methodology as well as the rate itself for the first two years of the four-year period. Under the government’s regulation, customers may return to the Rate of Last Resort at any time, and the price for the second two-year term may only vary from the first two-year term by 10%. The new rates may provide risks and benefits to the Company.\nRegional Regulatory Developments\nNRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO regions. For further discussion on regulatory developments, see Item 15 — Note 23, \nRegulatory Matters,\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nERCOT/PUCT\nPublic Utility Commission of Texas’ Actions with Respect to Wholesale Pricing and Market Design — \nThe PUCT continues to analyze and implement multiple options for promoting increased reliability in the wholesale electric market, including the adoption of a reliability standard for resource adequacy and market-based mechanisms to achieve this standard. The Commission adopted a reliability standard that became effective in September 2024.\nIn 2023, the Texas Legislature authorized implementation of the Performance Credit Mechanism (\"PCM\"), which will measure real-time contribution to system reliability and provide compensation for resources to be available, subject to certain \"guardrails\" such as an absolute annual net cost cap, as part of its adoption of the PUCT Sunset Bill (House Bill 1500). The Texas Legislature also directed the PUCT to implement additional market design changes such as the creation of a new ancillary service called Dispatchable Reliability Reserve Service (\"DRRS\") to further increase ERCOT's capability to manage net load variability and firming requirements for new generation resources which penalize poor performance during periods of low grid reserves. The PUCT directed ERCOT to implement DRRS as a standalone product which will delay implementation until 2026 or 2027.\nTexas Energy Fund\n — Through Senate Bill 2627, the Texas Legislature created the Texas Energy Fund, which received voter approval in November 2023, and will provide grants and low-interest loans (3%) to incentivize the development of more dispatchable generation and smaller backup generation in ERCOT. The PUCT adopted a rule in March 2024, which establishes the application and participation requirements and the process by which the Texas Energy Fund loan proceeds for dispatchable generation in ERCOT will be distributed. The initial window for submitting loan applications was opened on June 1, 2024 and closed on July 27, 2024. NRG, through its subsidiaries, filed for loan proceeds for three separate projects, totaling more than 1,500 MWs of capacity. The PUCT also adopted a rule for the completion bonus grant program in April 2024, which provides for opportunities for grants of $120,000 per MW for dispatchable generation projects interconnected before June 1, 2026, or $80,000 per MW for dispatchable generation projects interconnected on or after June 1, 2026 but before June 1, 2029, subject to performance requirements. Applications for completion bonus grants can be submitted beginning in January 2025. Availability of grant funds may be impacted by the 10,000 MW collective cap on the ERCOT loan and grant program.\nOn August 29, 2024, the PUCT approved an initial portfolio of projects to move into a due diligence process with its third-party administrator. NRG THW GT LLC's 415 MW gas peakers, which is projected to become commercially operational in 2026, was among the projects selected to move into diligence, and that process is underway. On December 12, 2024, the PUCT approved two additional projects to move into due diligence, including Cedar Bayou Unit 5’s 689 MW combined cycle generating facility, which is projected to become commercially operational in 2028. Approximately 9,700 MW of projects are currently approved to undergo due diligence.\nReal-time Co-optimization of Energy and Ancillary Services (\"RTC\") \n— ERCOT is progressing with a multi-year project to upgrade its systems to co-optimize the dispatch of energy and ancillary services in real-time. The RTC project will also replace the Operating Reserve Demand Curve with demand curves for each ancillary service product which will act as the primary scarcity pricing mechanism when energy or ancillary services are in shortage. ERCOT anticipates commencing market trials for testing the RTC project in Spring 2025 with production to go-live on December 5, 2025.\nSupreme Court of Texas Ruling on Pricing during Winter Storm Uri\n — On June 14, 2024, the Supreme Court of Texas affirmed the validity of two orders issued by the PUCT on February 15 and 16, 2021, respectively, governing scarcity pricing in the ERCOT wholesale electricity market during Winter Storm Uri. The Supreme Court's order reversed the judgment of the Third Court of Appeals, which had held that the PUCT exceeded its statutory authority by ordering the market price of energy to be set at the high system wide offer cap due to scarcity conditions as a result of firm load shed occurring in ERCOT. In addition to holding that the PUCT's orders were consistent with the agency's statutory authority, the Supreme Court of Texas found that the PUCT had substantially complied with the Administrative Procedure Act's procedural rulemaking requirements in issuing its orders.\n16\n                                                     \nVoluntary Mitigation Plan (“VMP”) Changes \n— On March 13, 2023, the PUCT Staff determined that a portion of NRG's VMP should be terminated due to the increase in procurement of ancillary services by ERCOT, specifically non-spin reserve services, following Winter Storm Uri. As such, PUCT Staff terminated part of the VMP for NRG which provides protection from wholesale market power abuse accusations related to offers for ancillary services. NRG agreed with these changes to the VMP. At the March 23, 2023 open meeting, the PUCT approved the amended VMP. In February 2024, NRG filed a notice of intent with the PUCT and terminated its existing VMP as of March 1, 2024.\nLubbock, Texas Transition to Competition\n — The customers of Lubbock Power and Light (\"LP&L\"), a municipally owned utility, entered the Texas retail competitive market in March 2024. Starting in January 2024, LP&L customers were able to shop for a REP. Customers who did not select a REP by February 15, 2024 were assigned to one of three default REPs, one of which is Reliant. LP&L customers started transitioning to their chosen REP or a default REP on March 4, 2024, which concluded in early April 2024.\nPJM\nCapacity Market Litigation and Reforms \n— On September 27, 2024, various public interest organizations filed a complaint at FERC against PJM seeking changes to the treatment of RMRs in the capacity market. On November 18, 2024, various state consumer advocates filed a complaint at FERC against PJM seeking revisions to several aspects of PJM’s capacity market, including requiring resources previously subject to categorical exemptions to participate in capacity auctions, longer notice periods for deactivating generating resources, and several other changes. On December 9, 2024, PJM submitted a filing at FERC proposing various capacity market updates regarding the treatment of qualifying resources that are retained under RMR agreements as capacity, retention of a dual-fuel fired combustion turbine plant as the reference resource, and updates to the Non-Performance Charge based on the RTO Net CONE for the 2026/2027 and 2027/2028 Delivery Years. On February 14, 2025, FERC approved PJM’s filings. On December 13, 2024, PJM filed tariff changes to add provisions enabling a one-time reliability-based expansion of the eligibility criteria for PJM’s interconnection process intended to allow a limited number of additional resources to participate in an upcoming interconnection queue. On February 11, 2025, FERC approved PJM’s filing. On December 20, 2024, PJM submitted tariff changes that propose to require all Existing Generation Capacity Resources to offer into the capacity auctions beginning with the 2026/2027 Delivery Year as well as certain enhancements to the Market Seller Offer Cap. On February 20, 2025, FERC approved PJM’s filing. On December 30, 2024, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a complaint at FERC alleging that PJM’s demand curve cap is unjust and unreasonable. The complaint seeks to lower the demand curve cap to be 1.5 times net CONE of the reference resource. On January 28, 2025, PJM notified stakeholders that it had reached an agreement with Governor Shapiro, and on February 14, 2025, PJM and Governor Shapiro filed a join settlement agreement establishing the capacity market temporary price cap and price floor for the next two auctions and also filed a motion to dismiss the December 30, 2024 complaint. Any changes approved by FERC could affect future capacity prices.\nRevisions to PJM Locational Deliverability Area (“LDA”) Reliability Requirement\n — The Base Residual Auction (\"BRA\") for the 2024/2025 delivery year commenced on December 7, 2022 and closed on December 13, 2022. On December 19, 2022, PJM announced that it would delay the publication of the auction results. On December 23, 2022, PJM made a filing at FERC to revise the definition of LDA Reliability Requirement in the Tariff. This would allow PJM to exclude certain resources from the calculation of the LDA Reliability Requirement. On February 21, 2023, FERC accepted PJM's filing. Multiple parties, including NRG, filed for rehearing. Rehearing was denied by operation of law, and multiple parties, including the Company, filed appeals to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. On March 12, 2024, the court vacated the portion of the FERC orders that allow PJM to apply the LDA Reliability Requirement to the 2024/2025 capacity auction. On March 29, 2024, PJM filed a petition seeking confirmation as to the capacity commitments rules for the 2024/2025 auction. On April 22, 2024, multiple parties filed a complaint seeking to find the revised rate unjust and unreasonable and implement rates consistent with FERC's February 2023 decision, which was denied on July 9, 2024. Those parties filed an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on November 5, 2024.\nOn May 6, 2024, FERC directed PJM to recalculate the 2024/2025 auction results under the Initial LDA Reliability Requirement rules, and further directed PJM to rerun the Third Incremental Auction. PJM published the revised BRA and Third Incremental Auction results on May 8, 2024 and May 23, 2024, respectively. On June 14, 2024, multiple parties filed appeals to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals seeking review of the May 6, 2024 FERC orders approving PJM's petition to restore the original capacity commitment rules for PJM to recalculate the 2024/2025 BRA and the rerun of the 2024/2025 BRA. As a result, the capacity for the 2024/2025 delivery year in the Delmarva Power and Light South zone resulted in higher prices. This outcome may change depending upon the disposition of the outstanding complaint and appeals.\n17\n                                                     \nPJM Base Residual Auction Revisions and Delay — \nOn October 13, 2023, PJM made two filings at FERC. In the first filing, PJM proposed revisions to the Market Seller Offer Cap, which FERC rejected on February 6, 2024. The second filing proposed to make changes to PJM’s resource adequacy risk modeling and capacity accreditation processes, which FERC approved, with condition, on January 20, 2024. The approved changes were in effect for the 2025/2026 BRA that occurred in July 2024. In November 2024, at PJM’s request, FERC approved delays to future BRAs. The 2026/2027 BRA is currently scheduled for July 2025.\nIndian River RMR Proceeding \n— On June 29, 2021, Indian River notified PJM that it intended to retire Unit 4, effective May 31, 2022, due to expected uneconomic operations. On July 30, 2021, PJM responded to the deactivation notice and stated that PJM had identified reliability violations resulting from the proposed deactivation of Unit 4. NRG filed a cost based RMR rate schedule at FERC on April 1, 2022. FERC accepted the rate schedule with a June 1, 2022 effective date, subject to refund and established hearing and settlement procedures. The Company reached settlement with a number of the intervening parties and the settlement agreement was filed at FERC on April 2, 2024. On January 16, 2025, FERC issued an order approving the settlement agreement. On February 14, 2025, the Independent Market Monitor and the Maryland Office of the People’s Counsel filed a request for a rehearing of the January 16, 2025 FERC order. PJM announced the Delmarva Power transmission upgrades were completed in December 2024 and as a result, PJM sent NRG a termination notice. Indian River Unit 4 retired on February 23, 2025.\nIndependent Market Monitor Market Seller Offer Cap Complaint \n— \nOn March 18, 2021, finding that the calculation of the default Market Seller Offer Cap was unjust and unreasonable, FERC issued an order, which permitted the PJM May 2021 capacity auction for the 2022/2023 delivery year to continue under the existing rules and set a procedural schedule for parties to file briefs with possible solutions. On September 2, 2021, FERC issued an order in response to a complaint filed by the PJM Independent Market Monitor's proposal, which eliminated the Cost of New Entry-based Market Seller Offer Cap, implemented a limited default cap for certain asset classes based on going-forward costs and provided for unit specific cost review by the Independent Market Monitor for all other non-zero offers into the auctions. On October 4, 2021, as required by the Order, PJM submitted its compliance tariff and certain parties filed a motion for rehearing, which was denied by operation of law. On February 18, 2022, FERC addressed the arguments raised on rehearing and rejected the rehearing requests. Multiple parties filed appeals at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and on August 15, 2023, the Court denied the petitions for review. On January 12, 2024, the generator trade association filed a petition for review with the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the August 15, 2023 judgment. On May 28, 2024, the U.S Supreme Court denied the petition for review.\nFinal Rule on Reactive Power Payments \n— On October 17, 2024, FERC issued its final rule on reactive power, eliminating compensation for a generator’s reactive power within the standard power factor. ISOs must make a compliance filing, but FERC will permit ISO-NE, NYISO, and PJM to request a later effective date. This change affects the payments provided to generators providing reactive power service.\nChange to Energy Efficiency in the PJM Capacity Auction \n—\n \nOn November 5, 2024, FERC approved PJM’s proposal to terminate compensation paid through the PJM capacity market to energy efficiency resources beginning in the 2026/2027 auction year. However, energy efficiency resources will be counted as a reduction in the PJM load forecast that is the basis of the PJM capacity auction. FERC's action will eliminate wholesale market financial support for utility-run programs authorized by state utility commissions, as well as certain third-party providers of energy efficiency services. NRG's demand-side programming is not significantly affected by the modification\n.\nOther Regulatory Matters \nFrom time to time, NRG entities may be subject to examinations, investigations and/or enforcement actions by federal, state and provincial licensing and regulatory agencies and may face the risk of penalties for violation of financial services, consumer protection and other applicable laws and regulations.\nEnvironmental Regulatory Matters\nNRG is subject to numerous environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of power plants. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and maintained during operation of power plants. Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent over time. Future laws may require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls, impose restrictions on the Company's operations including unit retirements or impose obligations related to historic coal ash use, storage and disposal. Complying with environmental laws often involves specialized human resources and significant capital and operating expenses, as well as occasionally curtailing operations. NRG decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options and the expected economic returns on capital.\n18\n                                                     \nSeveral regulations that affect the Company have been and continue to be revised by the EPA, including requirements regarding coal ash, GHG emissions, NAAQS revisions and implementation, and effluent limitation guidelines. NRG will evaluate the impact of these regulations as they are revised but cannot fully predict the impact of each until anticipated revisions, legal challenges and reconsiderations are resolved. \nAir\n \nThe CAA and related regulations (as well as similar state and local requirements) have the potential to affect air emissions, operating practices and pollution control equipment required at power plants. Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for certain pollutants including SO\n2\n, ozone, and PM2.5. Many of the Company's facilities are located in or near areas that are classified by the EPA as not achieving certain NAAQS (non-attainment areas). The relevant NAAQS may become more stringent. In March 2024, the EPA increased the stringency of the PM2.5 NAAQS. The Company maintains a comprehensive compliance strategy to address continuing and new requirements. Complying with increasingly stringent air regulations could require the installation of additional emissions control equipment at some NRG facilities or retiring of units if installing such controls is not economic. Significant changes to air regulatory programs affecting the Company are described below. \nCPP/ACE Rules \n— The attention in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal and state regulations. In 2019, the EPA promulgated the ACE rule, which rescinded the CPP, which had sought to broadly regulate CO\n2\n emissions from the power sector. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule (but on February 22, 2021, at the EPA's request, stayed the issuance of the portion of the mandate that would vacate the repeal of the CPP). On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the \"generation shifting\" approach in the CPP exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress. The Court did not address the related issues of whether the EPA may adopt only measures applied at each source. On May 9, 2024, the EPA promulgated a rule that repealed the ACE rule and significantly revised the manner in which new combustion-turbine and existing steam EGU's GHG emissions will be regulated including capturing and storing/sequestering CO\n2\n in some instances. This rule has been challenged by numerous parties in the D.C. Circuit including 27 states with 22 states intervening in support of the rule. The DC Circuit held oral arguments related to this rule in December 2024. On February 5, 2025, the DOJ filed a motion asking the court to hold proceedings in abeyance while the new administration evaluates the rule. The court granted the motion on February 19, 2025.\nCross-State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”)\n — On March 15, 2023, the EPA signed and released a prepublication of a final rule that sought to significantly revise the CSAPR to address the good-neighbor obligations of the 2015 ozone NAAQS for 23 states after earlier having disapproved numerous state plans to address the issue. Several states, including Texas, challenged the EPA's disapproval of their state plans. On May 1, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed the EPA's disapproval of Texas' and Louisiana's state plans, which disapprovals are a condition precedent to the EPA imposing its plan on Texas and Louisiana. Several other states are also similarly situated because of similar stays. Nonetheless, on June 5, 2023, the EPA promulgated this rule. On July 31, 2023, the EPA promulgated an interim final rule that addresses the various judicial orders that have stayed several State-Implementation-Plan disapprovals by limiting the effectiveness of certain requirements of the final rule promulgated on June 5, 2023 in Texas and several other states. On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the final rule in the 11 states where the rule had not already been stayed. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the legal challenges to the: (i) various state disapprovals; (ii) the final rule promulgated on June 5, 2023; and (iii) the interim final rule promulgated on July 31, 2023 that seeks to address the judicial orders. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule.\nRegional Haze Proposal\n — On May 2023, the EPA proposed to withdraw the existing Texas Sulfur Dioxide Trading Program and replace it with unit-specific SO\n2 \nlimits for 12 units in Texas to address requirements to improve visibility at National Parks and Wilderness areas. If finalized as proposed, the rule would result in more stringent SO\n2\n limits for two of the Company's coal-fired units in Texas. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this proposal.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions \n— NRG emits CO\n2\n when generating electricity at its facilities. Nearly all of NRG's domestic GHG emissions are subject to federal (U.S. EPA) GHG reporting requirements. \nNRG's climate goals are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2025, from its current 2014 base year, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Greenhouse gas emissions included in NRG's goals are directly controlled emissions, emissions from purchased electricity for NRG's consumption and emissions from employee business travel. In March 2021, the Science Based Targets initiative validated NRG's 2025 and 2050 goals as aligned with a 1.5 degree Celsius trajectory. This validation was based on NRG’s business in 2020, prior to its acquisition of Direct Energy and Vivint.\n \nFollowing the acquisitions, the magnitude of NRG’s indirect emissions changed, and the Company is currently in the process of analyzing these\n \nemissions.\nFrom the current 2014 base year through 2024, the Company's directly controlled CO\n2\ne emissions decreased from 58 million metric tons to 25 million metric tons, representing a cumulative 57% reduction. The decrease is attributed to reductions in fleet-wide annual net generation and an overall market-driven shift away from coal as a primary fuel to natural gas. The \n19\n                                                     \ncontinued achievement of NRG's 2025 emissions reduction targets could be impacted by volatility within the power markets, driven by market conditions and changes in regulatory policies.\nAs of December 31, 2024, less than 5% of the Company's consolidated revenues were derived from coal-fired operating assets.\nThe following charts reflect the Company’s domestic generation portfolio, including leased facilities and those accounted for through equity method investments, but excluding the battery storage and remaining renewables activity. Prior year information on U.S. CO\n2\ne emissions and U.S. generation was adjusted to remove divested assets. \nMercury and Air Toxics Standards (“MATS”) \n—\n \nOn May 7, 2024, the EPA promulgated a final rule that amends the MATS rule by, among other things, increasing the stringency of the filterable particulate matter standard at coal-burning units. The deadline for complying with this more stringent standard is 2027. Twenty three states have challenged this rule in the D.C. Circuit. Accordingly, the outcome of this rulemaking is uncertain. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule.\nByproducts\nIn April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. On July 30, 2018, the EPA promulgated a rule that amended the ash rule by extending some of the deadlines and providing more flexibility for compliance. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit found, among other things, that the EPA had not adequately regulated unlined ponds and legacy surface impoundments. On August 28, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure,\" which amended the April 2015 Rule to address the August 2018 D.C. Circuit decision and extend some of the deadlines. On November 12, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Closure Part B: Alternative Demonstration for Unlined Surface Impoundments,\" which further amended the April 2015 Rule to, among other things, provide procedures for requesting approval to operate existing ash impoundments with an alternate liner. On May 8, 2024, the EPA promulgated a rule that establishes requirements for: (i) inactive (or legacy) surface impoundments at inactive facilities and (ii) coal combustion residuals (\"CCR\") management units (regardless of how or when the CCR was placed) at regulated facilities. The rule also creates an obligation to conduct site assessments (at all active and certain inactive facilities) to determine whether CCR management units are present. The rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit and the outcome of the legal challenges is uncertain. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule.\nDomestic Site Remediation Matters\nUnder certain federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of a facility, including an electric generating facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. NRG may be responsible for property damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs incurred by a party in connection with hazardous material releases or threatened releases. These laws impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several. Cleanup obligations can often be triggered during the closure or decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills during its operations. \n20\n                                                     \nJewett Mine Lignite Contract \n— \nThe Company's Limestone facility historically burned lignite obtained from the Jewett mine. Active mining ceased as of December 31, 2016; however, the Company remains responsible for reclamation activities and is responsible for all reclamation costs. NRG has recorded an adequate ARO liability. The Railroad Commission of Texas has imposed a bond obligation of approximately $112 million for the reclamation of the Jewett mine, which NRG supports through surety bonds. The cost of the reclamation may exceed the value of the bonds. NRG may provide additional performance assurance if required by the Railroad Commission of Texas.\nWater\n \nThe Company is required under the Clean Water Act to comply with intake and discharge requirements, requirements for technological controls and operating practices. As with air quality regulations, federal and state water regulations have become more stringent and imposed new requirements. \nELG \n— In 2015, the EPA revised the ELG for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from FGD, fly ash, bottom ash and flue gas mercury control. In 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that, among other things, postponed the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA amended the rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA amended the 2015 ELG rule by: (i) altering the stringency of certain limits for FGD wastewater; (ii) relaxing the zero-discharge requirement for bottom ash transport water; and (iii) changing several deadlines. In October 2021, NRG informed its regulators that the Company intends to comply with the ELG by ceasing combustion of coal by the end of 2028 at its domestic coal units outside of Texas, and installing appropriate controls by the end of 2025 at its two plants that have coal-fired units in Texas. On May 9, 2024, the EPA promulgated a rule that revises the ELG by, among other things, further restricting the discharge of (i) FGD wastewater, (ii) bottom ash transport water, and (iii) combustion residual leachate. The rule was challenged in numerous courts, but the cases have been consolidated in the Eighth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. The outcome of the legal challenges is uncertain. On February 19, 2025, the DOJ filed a motion asking the court to hold proceedings in abeyance while the new administration evaluates the rule. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule. \nRegional Environmental Developments\nAsh Regulation in Illinois\n — On July 30, 2019, Illinois enacted legislation that required the state to promulgate regulations regarding coal ash at surface impoundments. On April 15, 2021, the state promulgated the implementing regulation, which became effective on April 21, 2021. NRG has applied for initial operating permits and construction permits (for closure and retrofits) as required by the regulation and is waiting for most of its permits to be issued by the Illinois EPA.\nHouston Nonattainment for 2008 Ozone Standard \n— In 2022, the EPA changed the Houston area’s classification from Serious to Severe nonattainment for the 2008 Ozone Standard. Accordingly, Texas is required to develop a new control strategy and submit it to the EPA.\nCustomers\nNRG sells to a wide variety of customers, primarily end-use customers in the residential, commercial and industrial, and wholesale sectors. The Company owns and operates power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers, such as utilities and other intermediaries. The Company had no customer that comprised more than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2024, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries had 15,637 employees, including 7,028 active smart home direct sales and installation individuals, which are largely seasonal. Approximately 4% of the Company's employees were covered by U.S. collective bargaining agreements. During 2024, the Company did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its facilities.\nNRG believes its employees are vital to its success and is committed to offering employees a rewarding career that provides opportunities for growth and the ability to make valuable contributions toward the achievement of the Company’s business objectives. NRG focuses on safety, health and wellness, employee engagement, talent development and total rewards for its workforce. \n21\n                                                     \nSafety\nSafety is embedded in the culture at NRG. The Company strives to begin meetings with a safety moment and regularly reminds its employees that safety comes first. NRG has achieved its targeted top decile safety record of Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable injury rates in each of the 5 previous years.\nThe following chart reflects the Company's 5 year safety record, excluding Vivint Smart Home which uses different industry specific safety benchmarks. \nHealth and Wellness\nNRG has continued to invest in the health and well-being of its employees and their families by providing programs that holistically support its employees’ physical, emotional, social and financial wellness, allowing employees the opportunity to take control of their well-being and focus on what matters most to them for a healthy, secure future. The Company includes well-being goals as a metric in the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP), ensuring participants are motivated to improve their overall well-being.\nEmployee Engagement\nNRG seeks to create work environments where employees are treated fairly and respectfully and where each voice matters. The Company seeks to build on that position by continually improving its hiring and promotion policies and supporting the growth of Business Resource Groups (“BRGs”). In these BRGs, employees can share, learn, and receive support from colleagues with whom they have an affinity based on shared backgrounds or interests. The Company strives to be a place that empowers employee growth that celebrates the individual employee and his or her unique backgrounds.\nTalent Development\nNRG deploys various talent development strategies and programs to develop leaders who can execute on the Company’s strategy and drive value for all stakeholders. The Board of Directors regularly engages with management on leadership development and succession planning, including providing feedback on development plans and bench strength for key senior leader positions. In 2024, the Company continued its annual Emerging Executive Leaders Program to strengthen the identified pipeline of future executives and create a cohort of high potential candidates to work on active company challenges or opportunities. Additionally, the Company expanded a front-line leader program called Peak Leadership to the entire company with the intent to onboard first-level leaders into their leadership role in select business units, and will look to continue growing the initiative in 2025. The Company has a performance management tool that emphasizes a continuous feedback loop and a robust online training curriculum covering topics such as leadership, communication and productivity. \n22\n                                                     \nTotal Rewards\nNRG seeks to provide market competitive compensation and benefits benchmarked against the industries in which the Company operate: energy, consumer services and, where appropriate, the entire market. To ensure incentives are properly aligned with business needs and can attract and retain qualified employees, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors actively reviews the Company's total rewards programs, including benchmarking, risk assessment, and program design. NRG offers full-time employees incentives designed to motivate and reward success, and it continues to evaluate its benefits and offerings taking into consideration the needs of its employees to ensure they are competitive and best serve its employees. Every two years, the Company engages an independent third-party to benchmark its compensation and benefits programs against its peers and report the results to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\nFor further discussion and recent available data regarding the Company’s efforts and programs please see the Company’s 2024 Proxy Statement and 2023 Sustainability Report, which are available on the Company’s website at: \nwww.nrg.com\n.

This change, along with additional financial statement disclosures, is meant to address investor inquiries by enhancing transparency to easier match expenses with revenues. The Company previously recorded amortization of capitalized contract costs related to fulfillment in cost of operations and amortization of capitalized contract costs related to customer acquisition primarily in selling, general and administrative costs in the consolidated statements of operations. Amounts for prior years were adjusted for comparative purposes. See Item 15 — Note 2 , \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n for further detail. The adjustments had no impact on the Company’s total operating costs and expenses, and total cash flows.\nThe Company has elected to omit discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by the consolidated financial statements presented. A discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2022 may be found in Part II, Item 7 \n— \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024, and is not materially impacted by the adjustments noted above.\nThe following discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to NRG’s plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions, and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the disclosures under Item 1A — \nRisk Factors\n of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nExecutive Summary\nNRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a leading energy and smart home company fueled by market-leading brands, proprietary technologies and complementary sales channels. Across the U.S. and Canada, NRG delivers innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under the brand names such as NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain Energy, and Vivint, while also advocating for competitive energy markets and customer choice. The Company has a customer base that includes approximately 8 million residential customers (comprised of 6 million retail energy customers and 2 million smart home customers) in addition to commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers, supported by approximately 13 GW of generation as of December 31, 2024.\nBusiness Environment\nThe industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company, its businesses, and the retail energy and power generation industry in 2024 and for the future medium term include:\nMarket Dynamics\n — The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates. Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, global liquified natural gas demand, exports of natural gas, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas customers and producers. In 2024, the average natural gas price at Henry Hub was $2.27 per MMBtu compared to $2.74 per MMBtu in 2023, representing a decrease of 17%.\nNRG may experience impacts to gross margins due to significant, rapid changes in current natural gas prices, the impact those prices have on power prices, and the lag in its ability to make a corresponding adjustment to the retail rates it charges customers on term and month to month contracts. The Company hedges its load commitments in order to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices, and as a result, these gross margin impacts would be realized in future periods until it is able to make the corresponding adjustments to the retail customer rates. \n46\n                                                     \nThe relative price of natural gas as compared to coal and prevailing power prices are the primary driver of coal demand. Coal commodity prices remained relatively flat in 2024.\nElectricity Prices\n — The price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the Company. Many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the Company's profitability. An increase in supply cost volatility in the competitive retail markets may result in smaller companies choosing to exit the market, which may result in further consolidation in the competitive retail space. The following table summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which NRG operates.\n \nAverage On-Peak Power Price ($/MWh)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 vs 2023\nRegion\n2024\n2023\nChange %\nTexas\nERCOT - Houston\n(a)\n$\n32.05 \n$\n74.32 \n(57)\n%\nERCOT - North\n(a)\n30.71 \n72.89 \n(58)\n%\nEast\nNY J/NYC\n(b)\n45.25 \n38.95 \n16 \n%\nNEPOOL\n(b)\n46.59 \n41.36 \n13 \n%\nCOMED (PJM)\n(b)\n31.86 \n32.72 \n(3)\n%\nPJM West Hub\n(b)\n40.75 \n39.34 \n4 \n%\nWest\nCAISO - SP15\n(b)\n29.95 \n60.17 \n(50)\n%\nMISO - Louisiana Hub\n(b)\n30.26 \n33.64 \n(10)\n%\n(a)\nAverage on-peak power prices based on real time settlement prices as published by the respective ISOs\n(b)\nAverage on-peak power prices based on day-ahead settlement prices as published by the respective ISOs\nLoad Growth — \nThe electric industry is expected to experience a surge in demand driven primarily by new manufacturing, industrial and data center facilities (inclusive of GenAI). The U.S. Energy Information Administration's 2023 Annual Energy Outlook, combined with external forecasts of GenAI, shows the potential for 500 TWh of incremental load across the U.S. through 2030, as compared to 2023. ERCOT's current long term load forecast shows peak demand increasing from 86 GW in 2024 to 137 GW in 2028. This load growth will require significant planning and construction of new generation and transmission.\nIncreased Awareness of, and Action to Combat, Climate Change\n — Diverse groups of stakeholders, including investors, asset managers, financial institutions, non-government organizations, industry coalitions, individual companies, consumer groups and academic institutions, are increasingly engaged in efforts to limit global warming in the post-industrial era to 1.5 degrees Celsius. As a result, policymakers and regulators at regional, national, sub-national and local levels of government, both in the U.S. and other parts of the world, are increasingly focused on actions to combat climate change. \nNRG actively monitors climate change related developments that could impact its business and regularly engages with a diverse set of stakeholders on these issues. Such engagement helps the Company identify and pursue potential opportunities both to decarbonize its business and better serve its customers. NRG is committed to providing transparent disclosures of its climate risks and opportunities to stakeholders.\nLower Carbon Infrastructure Development\n — Policy mechanisms at the state and federal level, including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, RPS, and carbon trading plans, have supported and continue to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid, and other lower carbon infrastructure technologies. According to ERCOT, 43% of 2024 energy consumption in the ERCOT market was generated from carbon emission-free resources, with wind power contributing 24%. In addition, as subsidies and incentives contribute to increases in renewable power sources, customer awareness and preferences are shifting toward sustainable solutions. Increased demand for sustainable energy products from both residential and commercial customers creates opportunities for diversified product offerings in competitive retail markets.\nDigitization and Customization\n — The electric industry is experiencing major technological changes in the way power is distributed and consumed by end-use customers. The electric grid is shifting from a centralized analog system, where power is generated from limited sources and flows in one direction, to a decentralized multidirectional system, where power can be generated from a number of distributed resources and stored or dispatched on an as-needed basis. In addition, customers are seeking new ways to engage with their power providers. Technologies like smart thermostats, smart appliances and electric vehicles are giving individuals more choice and control over their electricity usage. Power providers are starting to engage with \n47\n                                                     \ncustomers who have transitioned to smart homes with new offerings, including but not limited to behind-the-meter demand response, or virtual power plant products. Companies with large customer bases in competitive marketplaces are poised to create additional engagement with customers to help further integrate their smart home into their daily lives. \nWeather\n \n— Weather conditions in the regions of the U.S. in which NRG conducts business influence the Company's financial results. Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels and may also impact the availability of the Company's generating assets. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Company's results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures and resultant demand are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter. However, all regions of the U.S. typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG's operations are typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once. \nOther Factors\n \n— A number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for NRG's business. These factors include:\n•\nseasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;\n•\nextreme peak demands;\n•\nperformance of renewable generation;\n•\navailable supply resources;\n•\ntransportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;\n•\nlocation of NRG's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;\n•\nprocedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and\n•\nchanges in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.\nThese factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:\n•\nweather conditions;\n•\nmarket liquidity;\n•\ncapability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;\n•\nlocal transportation systems; and\n•\nthe nature and extent of electricity deregulation.\nEnvironmental Matters, Regulatory Matters and Legal Proceedings\n \n— Details of environmental matters are presented in Item 15 — Note 24, \nEnvironmental Matters\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1 \n—\n Business,\n Environmental Matters\n.

The remaining average tenure of these agreements is nine years. The Company expects to continue evaluating and executing similar agreements that support the needs of the business. The total GW entered into through Renewable PPAs may be impacted by contract terminations when they occur.\nSite Development Updates \nOn February 13, 2025, NRG signed a strategic Project Development Agreement with GE Vernova (“GEV”) and Kiewit’s subsidiary, TIC, to develop and construct up to 5.4 GW of new gas-fired, combined cycle generation projects. The generation facilities will be owned and operated by NRG. Additionally, NRG has entered into a slot reservation agreement with GEV for the procurement of 1.2 GW of 7HA gas turbines. The first projects under this comprehensive development agreement are expected to commence operations by the end of 2029.\n50\n                                                     \nConsolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table provides selected financial information for the Company:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nChange\nRevenue\n \n \n \nRetail revenue\n$\n27,149 \n$\n27,467 \n$\n(318)\nEnergy revenue\n(a)\n500 \n553 \n(53)\nCapacity revenue\n(a)\n177 \n197 \n(20)\nMark-to-market for economic hedging activities\n(3)\n144 \n(147)\nContract amortization\n(29)\n(32)\n3 \nOther revenues\n(a)(b)\n336 \n494 \n(158)\nTotal revenue\n28,130 \n28,823 \n(693)\nOperating Costs and Expenses\n \n \nCost of fuel\n890 \n992 \n102 \nPurchased energy and other cost of sales\n(c)\n19,371 \n20,610 \n1,239 \nMark-to-market for economic hedging activities\n(209)\n3,007 \n3,216 \nContract and emissions credit amortization\n(c)\n49 \n93 \n44 \nOperations and maintenance\n1,607 \n1,391 \n(216)\nOther cost of operations\n392 \n390 \n(2)\nCost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below)\n22,100 \n26,483 \n4,383 \nDepreciation and amortization\n1,403 \n1,295 \n(108)\nImpairment losses\n36 \n26 \n(10)\nSelling, general and administrative costs (excluding amortization of customer acquisition costs of $204, and $125, respectively, which are included in depreciation and amortization shown separately above)\n2,031 \n1,843 \n(188)\nProvision for credit losses\n314 \n251 \n(63)\nAcquisition-related transaction and integration costs\n30 \n119 \n89 \nTotal operating costs and expenses\n25,914 \n30,017 \n4,103 \nGain on sale of assets\n208 \n1,578 \n(1,370)\nOperating Income\n2,424 \n384 \n2,040 \nOther Income/(Expense)\n \n \n \nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\n20 \n16 \n4 \nImpairment losses on investments\n(7)\n(102)\n95 \nOther income, net\n44 \n47 \n(3)\n(Loss)/Gain on debt extinguishment\n(382)\n109 \n(491)\nInterest expense\n(651)\n(667)\n16 \nTotal other expenses\n(976)\n(597)\n(379)\nIncome/(Loss) Before Income Taxes\n1,448 \n(213)\n1,661 \nIncome tax expense/(benefit)\n323 \n(11)\n334 \nNet Income/(Loss)\n$\n1,125 \n$\n(202)\n$\n1,327 \n(a)\nIncludes realized gains and losses from financially settled transactions\n(b)\nIncludes trading gains and losses and ancillary revenues\n(c)\nIncludes amortization of SO\n2 \nand NO\nx \ncredits and excludes amortization of RGGI credits\nGross Margin\nThe Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as revenues less cost of fuel, purchased energy and other costs of sales, mark-to-market for economic hedging activities, contract and emission credit amortization and depreciation and amortization.\n51\n                                                     \nEconomic Gross Margin\nIn addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's management. Economic gross margin is defined as the sum of retail revenue, energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels, purchased energy and other cost of sales. Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization, emission credit amortization, depreciation and amortization, operations and maintenance, or other costs of operations.\nThe following tables present the composition and reconciliation of gross margin and economic gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2024 and

The $209 million gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period, as well as an increase in the value of open positions as a result of increases in natural gas and Northeast power prices. This was partially offset by a decrease in the value of open positions as a result of decreases in CAISO and Alberta power prices.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the $144 million gain in revenues from economic hedge positions was driven by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of decreases in power prices. The $3.0 billion loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period, as well as a decrease in the value of East and West/Other open positions as a result of decreases in natural gas and power prices. This was partially offset by an increase in the value of Texas open positions as a result of increases in ERCOT power prices.\nIn accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy commodities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

For the same period in 2023, NRG recorded income tax benefit of $11 million on a pre-tax loss of $213 million. The effective tax rate was 22.3% and 5.2% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, NRG's overall effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to permanent differences and state tax expense partially offset by tax benefits from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and decrease of certain state valuation allowances.\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions, except effective income tax rate)\n2024\n2023\nIncome/(Loss) before income taxes\n$\n1,448 \n$\n(213)\nTax at federal statutory tax rate\n304 \n(45)\nState taxes\n92 \n(22)\nForeign rate differential\n1 \n(10)\nChanges in state valuation allowances\n(110)\n42 \nNondeductible loss on Convertible Senior Notes repurchases\n56 \n— \nPermanent differences\n23 \n31 \nStock compensation\n(19)\n— \nRecognition of uncertain tax benefits\n1 \n12 \nDeferred impact of state tax rate changes\n(24)\n3 \nForeign tax refunds\n— \n(17)\nReturn to provision adjustments\n(1)\n(5)\nIncome tax expense/(benefit)\n$\n323 \n$\n(11)\n   Effective income tax rate\n22.3 \n%\n5.2 \n%\nThe effective income tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses and changes in valuation allowances in accordance with ASC 740, \nIncome Taxes\n (\"ASC 740\"). These factors and others, including the Company's history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity Position\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, NRG's liquidity, excluding collateral funds deposited by counterparties, was approximately $5.4 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, comprised of the following:\n \nAs of December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n966 \n$\n541 \nRestricted cash - operating \n4 \n21 \nRestricted cash - reserves\n (a)\n4 \n3 \nTotal\n974 \n565 \nTotal availability under Revolving Credit Facility and collective collateral facilities\n(b)\n4,469 \n4,278 \nTotal liquidity, excluding collateral funds deposited by counterparties\n$\n5,443 \n$\n4,843 \n(a)\nIncludes reserves primarily for debt service, performance obligations and capital expenditures\n(b)\nTotal capacity of Revolving Credit Facility and collective collateral facilities was $7.3 billion and $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively\nAs of December 31, 2024, total liquidity, excluding collateral funds deposited by counterparties, increased by $600 million. Changes in cash and cash equivalent balances are further discussed under the heading \nCash Flow Discussion\n. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024, were predominantly held in bank deposits.\n62\n                                                     \nManagement believes that the Company's liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund dividends, and to fund other liquidity commitments in the short and long-term. Management continues to regularly monitor the Company's ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows includes certain draws from, and payments to, the revolving credit facility and other credit facilities which are not eligible for net reporting. These transactions are for short term liquidity purposes. \nCredit Ratings\nOn March 18, 2024, S&P affirmed the Company's issuer credit rating of BB and changed the rating outlook from Stable to Positive.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's current credit ratings:\n \nS&P\nMoody's\nFitch\nNRG Energy, Inc.\nBB Positive\nBa1 Stable\nBB+ Stable\nSenior Secured Debt\nBBB-\nBaa3\nBBB-\nSenior Unsecured Debt\nBB\nBa2\nBB+\nPreferred Stock\nB\nBa3\nBB-\nLiquidity\nThe principal sources of liquidity for NRG's operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. As described in Item 15 — Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases,\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist mainly of the Senior Notes, Convertible Senior Notes, Senior Secured First Lien Notes, Revolving Credit Facility, the Receivables Securitization Facilities and tax-exempt bonds. The Company also issues letters of credit through bilateral letter of credit facilities and the pre-capitalized trust securities facility.\nThe Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) market operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations, as described more fully in Item 15 — Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including maintenance, environmental, and investments and integration; and (iv) allocations in connection with acquisition opportunities, debt repayments, share repurchases and dividend payments to stockholders, as described in Item 15 — Note 15, \nCapital Structure\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSale of Airtron\nOn September 16, 2024, the Company closed on the sale of its 100% ownership in the Airtron business unit.

Pursuant to the Joinder Agreement, the Additional Originator agrees to be bound by the terms of the Receivables Sale Agreement, will sell to NRG Receivables substantially all of its Receivables and in connection therewith have transferred to NRG Receivables the deposit accounts into which the proceeds of such Receivables are paid.\nConcurrently with the amendments to the Receivables Facility, the Company and the originators thereunder terminated the existing uncommitted Repurchase Facility.\nSenior Secured First Lien Note Repayment\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company repaid $600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.750% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024.\nVivint Term Loan \nOn April 10, 2024, the Company’s wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Vivint, entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Second Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 9, 2021 (the “Vivint Credit Agreement”) with, among others, Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent (the “Vivint Agent”), and certain financial institutions, as lenders, which amended the Vivint Credit Agreement in order to (i) reprice its term loan B facility (the term loans thereunder, the “Vivint Term Loans”) and (ii) make certain other modifications to the Vivint Credit Agreement as set forth therein.\nOn October 30, 2024, the Company repaid in full the outstanding Vivint Term Loans of approximately $1.3 billion and terminated the revolving credit facility under the Vivint Credit Agreement.\nLiability Management\nThe Company executed $342 million in liability management in 2024 and achieved its targeted credit metrics. The Company intends to spend approximately $270 million from cash from operations during 2025. The Company remains committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and its targeted credit metrics. \nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Contributions\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company’s estimated pension minimum funding requirements for the next 5 years were $108 million, of which $16 million are required to be made within the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s estimated other postretirement benefits minimum funding requirements for the next 5 years were $24 million, of which $5 million are required to be made within the next 12 months. These amounts represent estimates based on assumptions that are subject to change. For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 14, \nBenefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n65\n                                                     \nDebt Service Obligations \nPrincipal payments on debt and finance leases as of December 31, 2024, are due in the following periods:\n(In millions)\nDescription\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotal\n Recourse Debt:\n \n \n \n \n \n5.750% Senior Notes, due 2028\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n821 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n821 \n5.250% Senior Notes, due 2029\n— \n— \n— \n— \n733 \n— \n733 \n3.375% Senior Notes, due 2029\n— \n— \n— \n— \n500 \n— \n500 \n5.750% Senior Notes, due 2029\n— \n— \n— \n— \n798 \n— \n798 \n3.625% Senior Notes, due 2031\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n1,030 \n1,030 \n3.875% Senior Notes, due 2032\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n480 \n480 \n6.000% Senior Notes, due 2033\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n925 \n925 \n6.250% Senior Notes, due 2034\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n950 \n950 \n2.750% Convertible Senior Notes, due 2048\n232 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n232 \n2.000% Senior Secured Notes, due 2025\n500 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n500 \n2.450% Senior Secured Notes, due 2027\n— \n— \n900 \n— \n— \n— \n900 \n4.450% Senior Secured Notes, due 2029\n— \n— \n— \n— \n500 \n— \n500 \n7.00% Senior Secured Notes, due 2033\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n740 \n740 \nTax-exempt bonds\n247 \n— \n— \n59 \n— \n160 \n466 \nTerm Loan B, due 2031\n11 \n14 \n13 \n13 \n13 \n1,253 \n1,317 \nSubtotal Recourse Debt\n990 \n14 \n913 \n893 \n2,544 \n5,538 \n10,892 \nFinance Leases:\nFinance leases\n6 \n4 \n3 \n1 \n— \n— \n14 \nTotal Debt and Finance Leases\n$\n996 \n$\n18 \n$\n916 \n$\n894 \n$\n2,544 \n$\n5,538 \n$\n10,906 \nInterest Payments\n$\n598 \n$\n578 \n$\n565 \n$\n486 \n$\n408 \n$\n877 \n$\n3,512 \nFor further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases.\nMarket Operations \nThe Company's market operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (e.g. buying power before receiving retail revenues); and (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions. As of December 31, 2024, market operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $309 million and $2.9 billion outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its market activities. As of December 31, 2024, total funds deposited by counterparties were $199 million in cash and $377 million of letters of credit. \nThe Company has entered into long-term contractual arrangements related to energy purchases, gas transportation and storage, and fuel and transportation services and generation projects. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had minimum payment obligations under such outstanding agreements of $9.0 billion, with $2.4 billion payable within the next 12 months and an additional $1.5 billion of short-term purchase energy commitments. For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 22, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n.\nFuture liquidity requirements may change based on the Company's hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the Company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.\nFirst Lien Structure\nNRG has the capacity to grant first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of the Company's assets, subject to various exclusions including NRG's assets that have project-level financing and the assets of certain non-guarantor subsidiaries, to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedge agreements. The first lien program does not limit the volume that \n66\n                                                     \ncan be hedged or the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. The first lien program also does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. The first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.\nThe Company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. As of December 31, 2024, all hedges under the first liens were in-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table summarizes the Company's capital expenditures for maintenance, environmental and investments and integration for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n(In millions)\nMaintenance\nEnvironmental\nInvestments and Integration\nTotal\nTexas\n$\n191 \n$\n18 \n$\n160 \n$\n369 \nEast\n— \n3 \n— \n3 \nWest/Services/Other\n15 \n— \n1 \n16 \nVivint Smart Home\n18 \n— \n5 \n23 \nCorporate\n19 \n— \n42 \n61 \nTotal cash capital expenditures for 2024\n243 \n21 \n208 \n472 \nIntegration operating expenses and cost to achieve\n— \n— \n60 \n60 \nInvestments\n— \n— \n180 \n180 \nTotal cash capital expenditures and investments for the year ended December 31, 2024\n$\n243 \n$\n21 \n$\n448 \n$\n712 \nInvestments and Integration for the year ended December 31, 2024 include growth expenditures, integration, small book acquisitions and other investments.\nEnvironmental Capital Expenditures Estimate\nNRG estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2025 through 2029 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately $73 million, primarily driven by the cost of complying with ELG at the Company's coal units in Texas.\nThe table below summarizes the status of NRG's coal fleet with respect to air quality controls as of December 31, 2024.

See Item 15 — Note 15, \nCapital Structure\n for additional discussion.\nIn October 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion for share repurchases as part of the existing share repurchase authorization, for a total of $3.7 billion. As of January 31, 2025, $1.5 billion is remaining under the $3.7 billion authorization.\nDividend Increase on Common Stock\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, NRG increased the annual dividend on its common stock to $1.63 from $1.51 per share. The Company returned $343 million of capital to common shareholders in the year ended 2024 through a $1.63 dividend per common share. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, NRG increased the annual common stock dividend to $1.76 per share, representing an 8% increase from 2024. The Company expects to target an annual common stock dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in subsequent years. \nOn January 22, 2025, NRG declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.44 per share, or $1.76 per share on an annualized basis, payable on February 18, 2025, to stockholders of record as of February 3, 2025. The Company's common stock dividends are subject to available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws and regulations.\nSeries A Preferred Stock Dividends\nIn March and September 2024, the Company declared and paid semi-annual dividends of $51.25 per share on its outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, each totaling $33 million.\nAdditional Material Cash Requirements Not Discussed Above\nOperating leases \n—\n \nThe Company leases generating facilities, land, office and equipment, railcars, fleet vehicles and storefront space at retail stores. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had lease payment obligations of $292 million, of which $85 million is payable within the next 12 months. For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 9, \nLeases\n. \nOther liabilities \n— Other liabilities includes water right agreements, service and maintenance agreements, stadium naming rights, stadium sponsorships, long-term service agreements and other contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had total of $270 million under such commitments,\n \nof which $49 million are payable within the next 12 months.\nContingent obligations for guarantees \n— NRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnifications and guarantee provisions as a routine part of the Company’s business activities. For further discussion, see Item 15 —Note 26, \nGuarantees\n.\nObligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity\nVariable Interest in Equity investments\n — NRG's investment in Ivanpah is a variable interest entity for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary. See also Item 15 — Note 16, \nInvestments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities,\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. NRG's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt was approximately $461 million as of December 31, 2024. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of Ivanpah to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. \n68\n                                                     \nCash Flow Discussion \n2024 compared to 2023\nThe following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the comparative years: \nYear ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nChange\nCash provided/(used) by operating activities\n$\n2,306 \n$\n(221)\n$\n2,527 \nCash used by investing activities\n(24)\n(910)\n886 \nCash used by financing activities\n(1,755)\n(400)\n(1,355)\nCash provided/(used) by operating activities\nChanges to cash provided/(used) by operating activities were driven by:\n(In millions)\nChanges in cash collateral in support of risk management activities due to change in commodity prices\n$\n2,051 \nIncrease in operating income adjusted for other non-cash items\n645 \nIncrease in working capital primarily due to lower gas pricing coupled with lower gas sales volumes\n341 \nDecrease in working capital primarily driven by capitalized contract costs and deferred revenues\n(396)\nDecrease in working capital primarily related to the payout of the Company's annual incentive plan in 2024 reflecting financial outperformance for 2023\n(114)\n$\n2,527 \nCash used by investing activities \nChanges to cash provided/(used) by investing activities were driven by:\n(In millions)\nDecrease in cash paid for acquisitions primarily due to the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home in March 2023\n$\n2,485 \nDecrease in proceeds from the sale of assets primarily due to the sale of the Company's 44% equity interest in STP in November 2023\n(1,506)\nDecrease in insurance proceeds for property, plant and equipment, net\n(237)\nDecrease in capital expenditures\n126 \nOther\n18 \n$\n886 \nCash (used)/provided by financing activities\nChanges in cash (used)/provided by financing activities were driven by:\n(In millions)\nDecrease due to repayments of long-term debt and finance leases\n$\n(2,732)\nIncrease in proceeds due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2024\n2,469 \nDecrease in proceeds due to the issuance of preferred stock in 2023\n(635)\nDecrease in net receipts from settlement of acquired derivatives\n(345)\nDecrease primarily due to debt extinguishment costs in 2024\n(275)\nIncrease due to less payments for share repurchase activity in 2024  \n187 \nIncrease in payments of dividends primarily due to preferred stock\n(24)\n$\n(1,355)\n69\n                                                     \n NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company had domestic pre-tax book income of $1.5 billion and foreign pre-tax book loss of $37 million. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company utilized U.S. federal NOLs of $1.4 billion, and tax credits of $103 million. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has cumulative U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $7 billion, of which $5.3 billion do not have an expiration date, and cumulative state NOL carryforwards of $6.1 billion for financial statement purposes. NRG also has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $394 million, most of which have no expiration date. In addition to the above NOLs, NRG has a $274 million indefinite carryforward for interest deductions, as well as $269 million of tax credits, inclusive of $61 million of CAMT credits to be utilized in future years. As a result of the Company's tax position, including the utilization of federal and state NOLs, and based on current forecasts, the Company anticipates income tax payments, due to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, of up to $125 million in 2025, excluding the impact of the proposed CAMT regulations. As of December 31, 2024, NRG as an applicable corporation is subject to the CAMT, and has reflected the impact in its current and deferred taxes. There is no impact on the Company’s provision for income taxes from the CAMT as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Company has $57 million of tax effected uncertain federal, state and foreign tax benefits for which the Company has recorded a non-current tax liability of $62 million (inclusive of accrued interest) until such final resolution with the related taxing authority. \nOn December 31, 2021, the OECD released rules which set forth a common approach to a global minimum tax at 15% for multinational companies, which has been enacted into law by certain countries effective for 2024. The Company's preliminary analysis indicates that there is no material impact to the Company's financial statements from these rules. \nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2021. With few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2015. \nGuarantor Financial Information\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's outstanding registered senior notes consisted of $821 million of the 2028 Senior Notes as shown in Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases\n. These Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of NRG's current and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries, or guarantor subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). See Exhibit 22.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of the Guarantors. These guarantees are both joint and several.\nNRG conducts much of its business through and derives much of its income from its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company's ability to make required payments with respect to its indebtedness and other obligations depends on the financial results and condition of its subsidiaries and NRG's ability to receive funds from its subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of any of the Guarantors to transfer funds to NRG. Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either NRG Energy, Inc. or the Guarantors (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “Non-Guarantors”). The Non-Guarantors include all of NRG's foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with Rule 3-10 under the SEC's Regulation S-X. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations or financial position of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table presents the summarized statement of operations: \n(In millions)\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nRevenue\n(a)\n$\n23,553 \nOperating income\n(b)\n2,382 \nTotal other expense\n(635)\nIncome before income taxes\n1,747 \nNet Income\n1,411 \n(a)\nIntercompany transactions with Non-Guarantors of $5 million during the year ended December 31, 2024\n(b)\nIntercompany transactions with Non-Guarantors including cost of operations of $26 million and selling, general and administrative of $349 million during the year ended December 31, 2024\n70\n                                                     \nThe following table presents the summarized balance sheet information:\n(In millions)\nAs of December 31, 2024\nCurrent assets\n(a)\n$\n6,090 \nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n1,318 \nNon-current assets\n15,208 \nCurrent liabilities\n(b)\n8,181 \nNon-current liabilities\n12,481 \n(a)\nIncludes intercompany receivables due from Non-Guarantors of $30 million as of December 31, 2024\n(b)\nIncludes intercompany payables due to Non-Guarantors that were de minimis as of December 31, 2024 \nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\nNRG may enter into energy purchase and sales contracts, fuel purchase contracts and other energy-related financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices and to hedge fuel requirements at power plants or retail load obligations. In order to mitigate interest risk associated with the issuance of the Company's variable rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. In addition, in order to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\nUnder Flex Pay, offered by Vivint Smart Home, customers pay for smart home products by obtaining financing from a third-party financing provider under the Consumer Financing Program. Vivint Smart Home pays certain fees to the financing providers and shares in credit losses depending on the credit quality of the customer.\nNRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.\nThe tables below disclose the activities that include both exchange and non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n (\"ASC 820\"). Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2024, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2024. For a full discussion of the Company's valuation methodology of its contracts, see \nDerivative Fair Value Measurements\n in Item 15 — Note 5, \nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDerivative Activity Gains\n(In millions)\nFair value of contracts as of December 31, 2023\n$\n648 \nContracts realized or otherwise settled during the period\n165 \nOther changes in fair value\n179 \nFair value of contracts as of December 31, 2024\n(a)\n$\n992 \n(a)\nIncludes $770 million of derivative contracts that were elected as NPNS on October 1, 2024 and are no longer valued at fair value on a recurring basis.

For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 6, \nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. Also, collateral received or posted on the Company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Company's portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A\n — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Commodity Price Risk\n, NRG measures \n71\n                                                     \nthe sensitivity of the Company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRG's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period VaR, which limits the Company's net open position. As the Company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of NRG's hedging activity. As of December 31, 2024, NRG's net derivative asset was $992 million, an increase to total fair value of $344 million as compared to December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by gains in fair value and roll-off of trades that settled during the period.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase or decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a change of approximately $1.0 billion in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2024.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the accounting guidance has not changed.\nNRG evaluates these estimates, on an ongoing basis, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.\n The Company identifies its most critical accounting estimates as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and require the most difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments by management about matters that are inherently uncertain.\n72\n                                                     \nSuch accounting estimates include:\nAccounting Estimate\nJudgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application\nDerivative Instruments\nAssumptions used in valuation techniques\nMarket maturity and economic conditions\nContract interpretation\nMarket conditions in the energy industry, especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments\nIncome Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\nInterpret existing tax statute and regulations upon application to transactions\nAbility to utilize tax benefits through carry backs to prior periods and carry forwards to future periods\nJudgement about future realization of deferred tax assets\nEvaluation of Assets for Impairment\nRegulatory and political environments and requirements\nEstimated useful lives of assets\nEnvironmental obligations and operational limitations\nEstimates of future cash flows\nEstimates of fair value\nJudgment about impairment triggering events\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nEstimated useful lives for finite-lived intangible assets\nJudgment about impairment triggering events\nEstimates of reporting unit's fair value\nFair value estimate of intangible assets acquired in business combinations\nBusiness Combinations\nFair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations\nEstimated future cash flow\nEstimated useful lives of assets\nContingencies\nEstimated financial impact of event(s)\nJudgment about likelihood of event(s) occurring\nRegulatory and political environments and requirements\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company follows the guidance of ASC 815, \nDerivatives and Hedging \"(A\nSC 815\"), to account for derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires the Company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize fair value change in earnings, unless they qualify for the NPNS exception. ASC 815 applies to NRG's energy related commodity contracts, interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and Consumer Financing Program. \nEnergy-Related Commodities\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, for purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, the Company primarily used quoted exchange prices and consensus pricing. Consensus pricing is provided by independent pricing services which are compiled from market makers with longer dated tenors as compared to broker quotes. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company valued derivatives based on price quotes from brokers in active markets who regularly facilitate those transactions. The Company started using consensus pricing as it offers data from more market makers and for longer dated tenors as compared to broker quotes, enhances data integrity, and increases transparency. When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value. These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nNRG is exposed to changes in interest rate through the Company's issuance of variable rate debt. To manage the Company's interest rate risk, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. In order to qualify the derivative instruments for hedged transactions, NRG estimates the forecasted borrowings for interest rate swaps occurring within a specified time period.\n73\n                                                     \nForeign Exchange Contracts\nIn order to mitigate foreign exchange risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\nConsumer Financing Program\nThe derivative positions for the Company's Consumer Financing Program are valued using a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions, such as collateral prepayment rates, collateral default rates and credit loss rates. In summary, the fair value represents an estimate of the present value of the cash flows Vivint Smart Home will be obligated to pay to the third-party financing provider for each component of the derivative.\nCertain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that the Company has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on expected load requirements, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.\nIncome Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets \nAs of December 31, 2024, NRG’s deferred tax assets were primarily the result of U.S. federal and state NOLs, the difference between book and tax basis in property, plant, and equipment, deferred revenues and tax credit carryforwards. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns and forecasting future profitability by tax jurisdiction.\nThe Company evaluates its deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis to determine whether adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate considering changes in facts or circumstances. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, when determining the future realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets. Given the Company’s current level of pre-tax earnings and forecasted future pre-tax earnings, the Company expects to generate income before taxes in the U.S. in future periods at a level that would fully utilize its U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and the majority of its state NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration.\nThe Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of $144 million as of December 31, 2024 against deferred tax assets consisting of state NOL carryforwards and foreign NOL carryforwards in jurisdictions where the Company does not currently believe that the realization of deferred tax assets is more likely than not. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's valuation allowance balance was $275 million.\nConsiderable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. The Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, including operations located in Australia and Canada.\n \nThe Company continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. \nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2021.\n \nWith few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2015.\nNRG does not intend, nor currently foresee a need, to repatriate funds held at its international operations into the U.S. These funds are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in its foreign operations and the Company has not changed its assertion with respect to distributions of funds that would require the accrual of U.S. income tax.\n74\n                                                     \nEvaluation of Assets for Impairment\nIn accordance with ASC 360, \nProperty, Plant, and Equipment (\"\nASC 360\"), the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events include:\n•\nSignificant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n•\nSignificant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;\n•\nAdverse business climate;\n•\nAccumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amounts originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;\n•\nCurrent period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and\n•\nChange in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold, or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nFor assets to be held and used, recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power and natural gas prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets, factoring in the different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques, such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\n Assets held-for-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. The Company considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence of such information, NRG may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers or employ other valuation techniques. The Company will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or asset. The use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in NRG's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material. \nAnnually, during the fourth quarter, the Company revises its views of power and fuel prices including the Company's fundamental view for long-term prices, forecasted generation and operating and capital expenditures, in connection with the preparation of its annual budget. Changes to the Company's views of long-term power and fuel prices impact the Company’s projections of profitability, based on management's estimate of supply and demand within the sub-markets for its operations and the physical and economic characteristics of each of its businesses.\nFor further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 10\n, \nAsset Impairments\n.\n \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company reported goodwill of $5.0 billion, consisting of $3.5 billion from the acquisition of Vivint in 2023, $1.2 billion from the acquisition of Direct Energy in 2021 and $0.3 billion from other retail acquisitions.\nThe Company applies ASC 805, \nBusiness Combinations\n (\"ASC 805\"), and ASC 350, \nIntangibles-Goodwill and Other (\"\nASC 350\") to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted-average useful lives. Goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit may be below the carrying amount. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, the Company performs a \n75\n                                                     \nquantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing to its book value. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, the Company's goodwill will be impaired at that time.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\nFor further discussion, see \nEvaluation of Assets for Impairment \ncaption above, and Item 15 — Note 10\n, \nAsset Impairments\n.\nBusiness Combinations \nNRG accounts for business acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting prescribed under ASC 805. Under this method, the Company is required to record on its Consolidated Balance Sheets the estimated fair values of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant estimates and judgments. Fair value is determined based on the estimated price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities from the Vivint Smart Home acquisition that involved the most subjectivity in determining fair value consisted of customer relationships, developed technology, trade names, acquired debt and derivative instruments. NRG describes in detail its acquisitions in Item 15 — Note 4, \nAcquisitions and Dispositions\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe fair value of the customer relationships, technology and trade names are measured using income-based valuation methodologies, which include certain assumptions such as forecasted future cash flows, customer attrition rates, royalty rates and discount rates. Customer relationships and technology are amortized to depreciation and amortization, ratably based on discounted future cash flows. Trade names are amortized to depreciation and amortization, on a straight line basis.\nThe acquired Vivint Smart Home debt was measured at fair value using observable market inputs based on interest rates at the acquisition closing date. The difference between the fair value at the acquisition closing date and the principal outstanding was being amortized through interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. On October 30, 2024, the Company repaid in full the outstanding Vivint Term Loans and terminated the revolving credit facility under the Vivint Credit Agreement. For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 12, \nLong-term Debt and Finance Leases.\nThe derivative liabilities in connection with the contractual future payment obligations with the financing providers under Vivint Smart Home’s Consumer Financing Program were measured at fair value at the acquisition closing date using a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions, such as collateral prepayment rates, collateral default rates and credit loss rates. Changes to the fair value are recorded each period through other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations. \nContingencies\nNRG records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 — Note 22, \nCommitments and Contingencies,\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Item 15 — Note 2, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments.\n76",
