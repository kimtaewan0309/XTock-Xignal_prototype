Business\nAgreement to Acquire IPG\nOn December 8, 2024, Omnicom entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, by and among Omnicom, EXT Subsidiary Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom, or Merger Sub, and IPG, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into IPG, or the Merger, with IPG surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, IPG shareholders will receive 0.344 shares of Omnicom common stock for each share of IPG common stock they own. Following the close of the Merger, Omnicom shareholders are expected to own approximately 60.6% of the combined company and IPG shareholders are expected to own approximately 39.4%, on a fully diluted basis. The completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals and the approval of the stockholders of both Omnicom and IPG. If completed, the Merger is expected to have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nOur Business\nWe are a strategic holding company providing data-inspired, creative marketing and sales solutions to many of the largest global companies. Our portfolio of companies includes our global networks, BBDO, DDB and TBWA, Omnicom Media Group, the DAS Group of Companies, and the Communications Consultancy Network. All of our global networks integrate their service offerings with the Omnicom branded practice areas, including Omnicom Health Group, Omnicom Precision Marketing Group, Omnicom Commerce Group, Omnicom Advertising Collective, Omnicom Public Relations Group, Omnicom Brand Consulting Group, Flywheel Digital and Omnicom Production, a practice area that brings together Omnicom’s global production capabilities, as well as our Experiential businesses and Execution & Support businesses, which includes Omnicom Specialty Marketing Group. In August 2024, we announced the formation of Omnicom Advertising Group, or OAG, a new global organization that aligns the world-class creative networks BBDO, DDB and TBWA, as well as leading agencies within the Omnicom Advertising Collective. OAG began operations in January 2025.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and compete against other global, national and regional advertising, marketing and communications services companies, as well as technology, social media and professional services companies. The proliferation of media channels, including the rapid development and integration of interactive technologies and media, has fragmented consumer audiences targeted by our clients. These developments make it more complex for marketers to reach their target audiences in a cost-effective way, causing them to turn to Omnicom for a customized mix of marketing and communications services designed to optimize their total marketing expenditure.\nOn a global, pan-regional, and local basis, our networks, practice areas and agencies provide a comprehensive range of services in the following fundamental disciplines: Media & Advertising, Precision Marketing, Public Relations, Healthcare, Branding & Retail Commerce, Experiential, and Execution & Support. Media & Advertising includes creative services across digital and traditional media, strategic media planning and buying, performance media, data analytics services, and Omnicom Production. Precision Marketing includes digital and direct marketing, digital transformation consulting, e-commerce operations, media execution, market intelligence and data and analytics. Public Relations services include corporate communications, crisis management, public affairs and media and media relations services. Healthcare includes corporate communications and advertising and media services to global healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. Branding & Retail Commerce services include brand and product consulting, strategy and research and retail marketing. Experiential marketing services include live and digital events and experience design and execution. Execution & Support includes field marketing, sales support, digital and physical merchandising, point-of-sale and product placement, as well as other specialized marketing and custom communications services. We operate in all major markets and have a large client base. Our geographic markets include the Americas, which includes North America and Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia-Pacific.\nOur business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients. While our networks, practice areas and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines, we organize our services around our clients. Our fundamental business principle is that our clients’ specific requirements are the central focus of how we structure our service offerings and allocate our resources. This client-centric business model requires that multiple agencies within Omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks utilizing our key client matrix organization structure. This collaboration allows us to cut across our internal organizational structures to execute our clients’ marketing requirements in a consistent and comprehensive manner. We use our client-centric approach to grow our business by expanding our service offerings to existing clients, moving into new markets and obtaining new clients. In addition, we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that fill gaps in our service delivery to our existing clients. \nIn addition to \n1\n \ncollaborating through our client service models, our agencies, practice areas and networks collaborate across internally developed technology platforms. Annalect and Omni, our proprietary data and analytics platforms, serve as the strategic resource for all of our agencies, practice areas and networks to share when developing client service strategies across our virtual networks. These platforms provide precision marketing and insights at scale across creative, media and other disciplines.\nWe believe generative AI will have a significant effect on how we provide services to our clients and how we enhance the productivity of our people. As with any new technology, we are working closely with our clients and technology partners to take advantage of the benefits of AI while being mindful of its limitations and risks, and privacy concerns. We are committed to responsible AI practices and collaboration to harness AI's potential, while evaluating related risks, such as ethical considerations, public perception and reputational concerns, intellectual property protection, regulatory compliance, privacy and data security concerns and our ability to effectively adopt this new emerging technology. The rapidly developing nature of AI technology makes it difficult to assess the full impact on our business at this time.\nDriven by our clients’ continuous demand for more effective and efficient marketing activities, we strive to provide an extensive range of marketing and communications services through various client-centric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives.\nOur service offerings include:\nadvertising\nmarketing research\nbranding\nmedia planning and buying\ncontent marketing\nmerchandising and point of sale\ncorporate social responsibility consulting\nmobile marketing\ncrisis communications\nmulti-cultural marketing\ncustom publishing\nnon-profit marketing\ndata analytics\norganizational communications\ndatabase management\npackage design\ndigital/direct marketing and post-production services\nproduct placement\ndigital transformation consulting\npromotional marketing\nentertainment marketing\npublic affairs\nexperiential marketing\npublic relations\nfield marketing\nretail marketing\nfinancial/corporate business-to-business advertising\nretail media and e-commerce\ngraphic arts/digital imaging\nsearch engine marketing\nhealthcare marketing and communications\nshopper marketing\ninstore design\nstudio production\ninteractive marketing\nsocial media marketing\ninvestor relations\nsports and event marketing\nCertain business trends have impacted our business and industry. These trends include clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to pan-regional and global markets and integrating traditional and non-traditional marketing channels, as well as utilizing new communications technologies and emerging digital platforms. As clients increase their demands for marketing effectiveness and efficiency, they tend to  pursue a strategy that covers all consumer touch points in an economically effective manner. Our portfolio of businesses provides clients with an array of strategic options and we have structured our business around these trends. We believe that our key client matrix organization structure approach to collaboration and integration of our services and solutions have provided a competitive advantage to our business in the past and we expect this to continue over the medium and long term. Our key client matrix organization structure facilitates superior client management and allows for greater integration across our service platforms. Our overarching strategy is to continue to use our virtual client networks to grow our business relationships with our largest clients by serving them across our networks, disciplines and geographies.\nWe continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to identify areas for investment and acquisition opportunities, as well as to identify non-strategic or underperforming businesses for disposition. In\n \nJanuary 2024\n, we acquired Flywheel Digital, the digital commerce business of Ascential plc, for a net cash purchase price of approximately \n$845 million\n. \nFor information about our acquisitions and dispositions, see Item 7, “MD&A - \nAcquisitions and Goodwill”\n and Notes 5, 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements. In each of the three years ended December 31, 2024, none of our acquisitions or dispositions, individually or in the aggregate, were material to our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe various components of our business, including revenue by discipline and geographic area, and material factors that affected us in the three years ended December 31, 2024, are discussed in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”).\n2\n \nOur Clients\nOur clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy. In many cases, multiple agencies, practice areas or networks serve different brands, product groups or both within the same client. For example, in 2024, our largest client represented 2.7% of revenue and was served by approximately 155 of our agencies. Our 100 largest clients, which represent many of the major marketers, represented approximately 54% of revenue and were each served, on average, by approximately 55 of our agencies. Although we have a large and diverse client base, we are not immune to general economic downturns.\nGovernment Regulations\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct business. Compliance with these laws and regulations in the normal course of business did not have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additional information regarding the impact of government regulations on our business is included in Item 1A, “Risk Factors - \nLegal and\n \nRegulatory Risks\n.”\nHuman Capital Resources and Environmental Sustainability Initiatives\nOur employees are our most important assets. We believe a critical component of our success depends on the ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline share many similarities. Common to all is the ability to understand the client’s brand or product and its selling proposition and to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client’s target audience, whether through traditional channels or digital platforms. Recognizing the importance of this core competency, we support and develop our employees through training and development programs that build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills.\nHuman capital management strategies are developed collectively by senior management, including the management teams of our networks, practice areas, and agencies, and are overseen by our Board of Directors. We are committed to efforts that ensure that the workplace is equitable, ethical, fosters an inclusive work environment across our global workforce and respects human rights. Our social and human capital management priorities include, among other things, adopting codes of conduct and business ethics, providing competitive wages and benefits, comprehensive training programs and succession planning.\nAt December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 74,900 people worldwide, including 31,200 people in the Americas, 26,800 people in EMEA, and 16,900 people in Asia-Pacific. The United States is our largest employee base, where we employed approximately 21,900 people. None of our regular employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. In certain countries outside the United States, primarily in Europe, some employees are represented by work councils. See MD&A for the effect of salary and related costs on our results of operations.\nOur environmental sustainability initiatives focus on emissions reductions through efficiency of office space, energy usage, travel and vendor engagement. In connection with our environmental sustainability efforts, we are a signatory to the UN Global Compact, a principle-based framework to encourage businesses and firms worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies. We support the UN Sustainable Development Goals, a collection of global goals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better, more inclusive and sustainable future. Our emissions reductions strategy, in line with the 1.5 degree Celsius climate scenario, was submitted to and approved by the Science Based Target initiative, or SBTi, which publicly audits companies on their emissions reduction efforts. Various regulatory bodies have proposed or enacted climate-related reporting requirements and similar proposals, including the SEC’s climate-related reporting proposal and California’s climate-related disclosure laws. The European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive has established disclosure requirements based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, or ESRS. However, reporting standards based on ESRS requirements are evolving for sustainability reporting, and regulations in other international markets are still evolving. We are monitoring the requirements in all the jurisdictions we operate and evaluating the impacts of those requirements and related reporting timelines.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nAt January 30, 2025, our executive officers were:\nName\nPosition\nAge\nJohn D. Wren\nChairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer\n72\nDaryl Simm\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer\n63\nPhilip J. Angelastro\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n60\nLouis F. Januzzi\nSenior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary\n51\n3\n \nMr. Simm was named President and Chief Operating Officer in November 2021 and previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Omnicom Media Group for more than 20 years. Mr. Januzzi was named Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary in December 2022 and previously served as Senior Vice President & Deputy General Counsel - Corporate from May 2021 to December 2022 and as Associate General Counsel - Corporate Development & Finance from March 2016 to May 2021. All other executive officers have held their present positions for at least five years. Additional information about our directors and executive officers will appear in our definitive proxy statement, which is expected to be filed with the SEC in March 2025.\nAvailable Information\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports and any amendments to those reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

  "item7": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts.)\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRisks and Uncertainties\nGlobal economic disruptions, including geopolitical events, international hostilities, acts of terrorism, public health crises, inflation or stagflation, tariffs and other trade barriers, central bank interest rate policies in countries that comprise our major markets and labor and supply chain challenges could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. The impact of these issues on our business will vary by geographic market and discipline. We monitor economic conditions closely, as well as client revenue levels and other factors. In response to reductions in revenue, we can take actions to align our cost structure with changes in client demand and manage our working capital. However, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of our efforts to mitigate any impact of the current and future adverse economic conditions, reductions in client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments.\nAgreement to Acquire IPG\nOn December 8, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with IPG. Upon closing, each share of IPG common stock will be exchanged for 0.344 shares of Omnicom common stock. The closing of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by Omnicom stockholders and IPG stockholders.  If completed, the Merger is expected to have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For additional information, see Item 1, “Business  - \nAgreement to Acquire IPG.\n” \nOur Business\nWe are a strategic holding company providing data-inspired, creative marketing and sales solutions to many of the largest global companies. Our portfolio of companies includes our global networks, BBDO, DDB, TBWA, Omnicom Media Group, the DAS Group of Companies, and the Communications Consultancy Network. All of our global networks integrate their service offerings with the Omnicom branded practice areas, including Omnicom Health Group, Omnicom Precision Marketing Group, Omnicom Commerce Group, Omnicom Advertising Collective, Omnicom Public Relations Group, Omnicom Brand Consulting Group, Flywheel Digital and Omnicom Production, a practice area that brings together Omnicom’s global production capabilities, as well as our Experiential businesses and Execution & Support businesses, which includes Omnicom Specialty Marketing Group.  In August 2024, we announced the formation of Omnicom Advertising Group, or OAG, a new global organization that aligns the world-class creative networks BBDO, DDB and TBWA, as well as leading agencies within the Omnicom Advertising Collective. OAG began operations in January 2025. In\n \nJanuary 2024\n, we acquired Flywheel Digital, the digital commerce business of Ascential plc, for a net cash purchase price of approximately \n$845 million\n.\nOn a global, pan-regional, and local basis, our networks, practice areas and agencies provide a comprehensive range of services in the following fundamental disciplines: Media & Advertising, Precision Marketing, Public Relations, Healthcare, Branding & Retail Commerce, Experiential, and Execution & Support. Media & Advertising includes creative services across digital and traditional media, strategic media planning and buying, performance media, data analytics services, and Omnicom Production. Precision Marketing includes digital and direct marketing, digital transformation consulting, e-commerce operations, media execution, market intelligence and data and analytics. Public Relations services include corporate communications, crisis \n13\nmanagement, public affairs and media and media relations services. Healthcare includes corporate communications and advertising and media services to global healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. Branding & Retail Commerce services include brand and product consulting, strategy and research and retail marketing. Experiential marketing services include live and digital events and experience design and execution. Execution & Support includes field marketing, sales support, digital and physical merchandising, point-of-sale and product placement, as well as other specialized marketing and custom communications services. We operate in all major markets and have a large client base. Our geographic markets include the Americas, which includes North America and Latin America, Europe, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific.\nOur business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients. While our networks, practice areas and agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines, we organize our services around our clients. Our fundamental business principle is that our clients’ specific requirements are the central focus of how we structure our service offerings and allocate our resources. This client-centric business model requires that multiple agencies within Omnicom collaborate in formal and informal virtual client networks utilizing our key client matrix organization structure. This collaboration allows us to cut across our internal organizational structures to execute our clients’ marketing requirements in a consistent and comprehensive manner. We use our client-centric approach to grow our business by expanding our service offerings to existing clients, moving into new markets and obtaining new clients. In addition, we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong entrepreneurial management teams that could fill gaps in our service delivery to our existing clients.\nWe believe generative AI will have a significant effect on how we provide services to our clients and how we enhance the productivity of our people. As with any new technology, we are working closely with our clients and technology partners to take advantage of the benefits of AI while being mindful of its limitations, risks, and privacy concerns. We are committed to responsible AI practices and collaboration to harness AI's potential, while evaluating related risks, such as ethical considerations, public perception and reputational concerns, intellectual property protection, regulatory compliance, privacy and data security concerns and our ability to effectively adopt this new emerging technology. The rapidly developing nature of AI technology makes it difficult to assess the full impact on our business at this time.     \nWe operate in all major markets and have a large client base. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our largest client represented 2.7% of revenue, and our 100 largest clients, which represent many of the world's major marketers, represented approximately 54% of revenue. Our clients operate in virtually every sector of the global economy, with no one industry representing more than 17% of our revenue in 2024. Although our revenue is generally balanced between the United States and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base, we are not immune to general economic downturns.\nGlobal economic conditions have a direct impact on our business and financial performance. Adverse global economic conditions pose a risk that our clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending on marketing and communications services, which would reduce the demand for our services. Revenue is typically lower in the first and third quarters and higher in the second and fourth quarters, reflecting client spending patterns during the year and additional project work that usually occurs in the fourth quarter. Certain global events targeted by major marketers for advertising expenditures, such as the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics, and certain national events, such as the U.S. election process, may affect our revenue year-over-year in certain businesses. Typically, these events do not have a significant impact on our revenue in any period.\nGiven our size and breadth, we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators. The key performance indicators that we focus on are revenue growth and variability of operating expenses. We analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth, including growth by principal regional market, practice area and marketing discipline, the impact from foreign currency exchange rate changes, growth from acquisitions, net of dispositions, and growth from our largest clients. Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, and depreciation and amortization, and are analyzed for each network by the chief operating decision maker, who allocates resources accordingly.\n Financial Performance\nWorldwide revenue in 2024 increased $996.9 million, or 6.8%, to $15.7 billion compared to $14.7 billion in 2023. Worldwide organic growth (defined below) increased revenue $768.7 million, or 5.2%, reflecting increased client spending in our Media & Advertising, Precision Marketing, Experiential and Public Relations disciplines and in all of our major geographic markets compared to the prior year. Our Public Relations discipline was helped by spending on the U.S. elections, and the Experiential discipline benefited from spending on the Summer Olympics. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue $65.5 million, or 0.4%, and acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, increased revenue $293.7 million, or 2.0% (see Note 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements).\nIn North America, organic revenue growth in 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by strong performance in the United States, especially in the Media & Advertising discipline, led by our media business, and our Precision Marketing, Experiential, and Public Relations disciplines. Our Public Relations discipline was helped by spending on the U.S. elections, and the Experiential discipline benefited from spending on the Summer Olympics. The organic growth was partially offset by underperformance in our Branding & Retail Commerce, Execution & Support and Healthcare disciplines. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, positively impacted revenue and were primarily related to the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024 and \n14\nacquisitions in the second half of 2023 in our Public Relations discipline, partially offset by dispositions in the Execution & Support discipline in the first half of 2023. \nIn Europe, organic revenue growth in 2024 compared to the prior year was driven by strong performance in our Media & Advertising discipline, led by our media business, and in our Experiential and Execution & Support disciplines, partially offset by underperformance in our Precision Marketing, Branding & Retail Commerce and Public Relations disciplines. Foreign currency exchange rate changes increased revenue year-over-year, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the British Pound, partially offset by the weakening of several currencies against the U.S. Dollar year-over-year. Acquisitions, net of dispositions for 2024, positively impacted revenue and were primarily related to the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024 and acquisition activity in our Media & Advertising discipline in the second half of 2023, partially offset by dispositions in the Execution & Support discipline in the first half of 2023.\nIn Latin America, organic revenue growth in 2024 compared to the prior year, increased in all disciplines, led by Media & Advertising, and in all countries in the region. The weakening of most currencies against the U.S. Dollar decreased revenue in 2024, compared to 2023. Acquisitions positively impacted revenue and were primarily related to acquisition activity in our Media & Advertising discipline in the prior year and the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024.\nIn Asia-Pacific, during 2024, organic revenue increased compared to 2023. Organic growth in our Media & Advertising discipline was partially offset by underperformance in our Precision Marketing and Public Relations disciplines. Substantially all markets in the region, especially China, India, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand, had positive organic revenue growth as compared to the prior year. Foreign currency changes decreased revenue for the year, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Japanese Yen and Chinese Reminbi against the U.S. Dollar. Acquisition activity, including the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024, increased revenue compared to the prior year.\nThe year-over-year changes in worldwide revenue in 2024, compared to 2023, in our fundamental disciplines were: Media & Advertising increased $575.0 million, Precision Marketing increased $347.4 million, Public Relations increased $100.3 million, Healthcare decreased $8.0 million, Branding & Retail Commerce decreased $60.8 million, Experiential increased $80.1 million and Execution & Support decreased $37.1 million.\nThe increases in worldwide revenue across our principal regional markets were: North America $699.2 million, Europe $172.1 million, Asia-Pacific $69.1 million and Latin America $46.9 million.\nA summary of our consolidated results of operations year-over-year:\n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n% Change\nRevenue\n$\n15,689.1\n$\n14,692.2\n$\n996.9 \n6.8 \n%\nOperating Income\n2,3\n$\n2,274.6\n$\n2,104.7\n$\n169.9 \n8.1 \n%\nOperating Margin\n2,3\n14.5\n \n%\n14.3 \n%\n0.2 \n%\nNet Income - Omnicom Group Inc.\n2,3\n$\n1,480.6\n$\n1,391.4\n$\n89.2 \n6.4 \n%\nNet Income per Share - Omnicom Group Inc.: Diluted\n2,3\n$\n7.46\n$\n6.91\n$\n0.55 \n8.0 \n%\nEBITA\n1,2,3\n$\n2,362.1\n$\n2,166.5\n$\n195.6 \n9.0 \n%\nEBITA Margin\n1,2,3\n15.1\n \n%\n14.7 \n%\n0.4 \n%\n1) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page \n30\n.\n2) In 2024, operating expenses included $57.8 million ($42.9 million after-tax) of repositioning costs, primarily related to severance, recorded in the second quarter of 2024 (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). Included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2024 are acquisition transaction costs of $14.6 million ($13.1 million after-tax), related to the proposed merger with IPG (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The net impact of these items reduced operating income for 2024 by $72.4 million ($56.0 million after-tax) and reduced diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. by $0.28. \nIn 2023, operating expenses included real estate operating lease impairment charges, severance and other exit costs of $191.5 million ($145.5 million after-tax) related to repositioning actions we took in the first and second quarters of 2023 to reduce our real estate requirements, rebalance our workforce, and consolidate operations in certain markets. In addition, in the second quarter of 2023, we recorded a gain of $78.8 million ($55.9 million after-tax) on the disposition of certain of our research businesses in the Execution & Support discipline. Included in the fourth quarter of 2023 within selling, general and administrative expenses are acquisition transaction costs of $14.5 million ($13.0 million after-tax), primarily related to the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024 (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). The net impact of these items reduced operating income for 2023 by $127.2 million ($102.6 million after-tax) and reduced diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. by $0.50 (see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements). \n3) \n Beginning in 2024, EBITA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes and amortization of acquired intangible assets and internally developed strategic platform assets. As a result, we reclassified the prior year to be consistent with the revised definition, which reduced EBITA from previously reported amounts. We believe EBITA is useful in evaluating the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets and internally developed strategic platform assets on operating performance and allows for comparability between reporting periods, the after-tax impact on diluted net income per share- Omnicom Group Inc. for 2024 and 2023 was $0.32 and $0.23, respectively.\n15\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe following summary of our critical accounting policies provides a better understanding of our financial statements and the related discussion in this MD&A. We believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than most of our accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. Readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, including Note 2, for a more complete understanding of the critical accounting policies discussed below.\nEstimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP and are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We use a fair value approach in testing our intangible assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, for impairment. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nAcquisitions and Goodwill\nWe have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions. The evaluation of potential acquisitions is based on various factors, including specialized know-how, reputation, geographic coverage, competitive position and service offerings of the target businesses, as well as our experience and judgment.\nOur acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach or their service capabilities to better serve our clients. Additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized know-how of the acquisition targets. Accordingly, as is typical in most service businesses, a substantial portion of the assets we acquire are intangible assets primarily consisting of the know-how of the personnel, which is treated as part of goodwill and is not required to be valued separately under U.S. GAAP. For each acquisition, we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets that are required to be valued separately. A significant portion of the identifiable intangible assets acquired is derived from customer relationships, including the related customer contracts, as well as trade names. In valuing these identified intangible assets, we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements.\n We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at May 1 and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Under FASB ASC Topic 350, \nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\n, we have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value (Step 0) or proceeding directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. While there were no trigger events that required us to perform a quantitative test, we performed the annual quantitative impairment test and compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying value, including goodwill. We identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments, which are our six global agency networks. The regional reporting units and practice areas monitor performance and are responsible for the agencies in their region. The regional reporting units report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our key client matrix organization structure for delivering services to clients in their regions. We have concluded that for each of our operating segments, their regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level. Our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in FASB ASC Topic 280, \nSegment Reporting\n, and in FASB ASC Topic 350. Consistent with our fundamental business strategy, the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries, and in many cases the same clients. In addition, the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics, and the employees share similar skill sets. The main economic components of each agency are employee compensation and related costs, and direct service costs and occupancy and other costs, which include rent and occupancy costs, technology costs that are generally limited to personal computers, servers and off-the-shelf software and other overhead expenses. Finally, the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared by multiple agencies in various regions as they work together to integrate the acquired business into our virtual client network strategy.\nGoodwill Impairment Review - Estimates and Assumptions\nWe use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units: (1) the income approach, which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows, (2) comparative market participant multiples for EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and (3) when available, consideration of recent and similar acquisition transactions.\nIn applying the income approach, we use estimates to derive the discounted expected cash flows (“DCF”) for each reporting unit that serves as the basis of our valuation. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin, EBITDA, tax rates, capital expenditures, weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected long-term cash flow growth rates. All of these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses, economic conditions related to the industry we operate in, as well as conditions in the global economy. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on our valuations derived using a DCF methodology are: (1) the expected long-term growth rate of our reporting units' cash flows and (2) the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) for each reporting unit.\n16\nThe long-term growth rate and WACC assumptions used in our evaluations:\nMay 1, 2024\nMay 1, 2023\nLong-Term Growth Rate\n3.5%\n3.5%\nWACC\n10.8% - 11.8%\n11.0% - 11.4%\nLong\n-term growth rate represents our estimate of the long-term growth rate for our industry and the geographic markets we operate in. For the past ten years, the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units and the Average Nominal GDP, or NGDP, growth of the countries comprising the major markets that account for substantially all of our revenue, was approximately 3.6% and 4.7%\n, respectively. We considered this history when determining the long-term growth rates used in our annual impairment test at May 1, 2024. Included in the 10-year history is the full year 2020, which included the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our revenue. We believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to NGDP, notwithstanding the volatility of inflationary environments. Based on our past performance, we also believe that our growth rate can exceed NGDP growth in the short-term in the markets we operate in, which are similar across our reporting units. Accordingly, for our annual test as of  May 1, 2024, we used an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.5%.\nWhen performing the annual impairment test as of May 1, 2024 and estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units, we considered the current macroeconomic environment, as well as industry and market specific conditions in 2024. In the first half of 2024, our organic revenue increase was 4.6%, which excluded our net disposition activity and the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.\nThe WACC is comprised of: (1) a risk-free rate of return, (2) a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market, (3) an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units, and (4) a current after-tax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units, each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt.\nOur six reporting units vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them. These differences drive variations in fair value among our reporting units. In addition, these differences as well as differences in book value, including goodwill, cause variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units. The goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of Omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interests that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded. The remaining three agency networks were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for using the acquisition method and as a result, they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt. Finally, the allocation of goodwill when components are transferred between reporting units is based on relative fair value at the time of transfer.\nGoodwill Impairment Review - Conclusion\nBased on the results of our impairment test, we concluded that our goodwill as of May 1, 2024 was not impaired, because the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its respective net book value. For our reporting units with negative book value, we concluded that the fair value of their total assets was in excess of book value. The minimum decline in fair value that one of our reporting units would need to experience in order to fail the goodwill impairment test was approximately 48%. Notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used for WACC and long-term growth rate in our impairment testing were reasonable, we performed a sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit. The results of this sensitivity analysis on our impairment test as of May 1, 2024 revealed that if the WACC increased by 1% and/or the long-term growth rate decreased by 1%, the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be in excess of its respective net book value and would pass the impairment test.\nWe will continue to perform our impairment test each year at May 1, unless events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim impairment test. There were no events through December 31, 2024 that would change our impairment assessment. The estimates used in our goodwill impairment test do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations, but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units as of the valuation date. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, but they are subject to change from year-over-year. Actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation, and it is possible that differences could be significant. A change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including its goodwill. A large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a non-cash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial  position. Additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in Notes 2, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\n17\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control and receives the benefit of the promised goods or services (the performance obligation) in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services (the transaction price). We measure revenue by estimating the transaction price based on the consideration specified in the client arrangement. Revenue is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. Our revenue is primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising, marketing, and communications services in the following fundamental disciplines: Media & Advertising, Precision Marketing, Public Relations, Healthcare, Branding & Retail Commerce, Experiential, and Execution & Support. Our client contracts are primarily fees for service on a rate per hour or per project basis. Revenue is recorded net of sales, use and value added taxes.\nPerformance Obligations. \nIn substantially all our disciplines, the performance obligation is to provide advisory and consulting services at an agreed-upon level of effort to accomplish the specified engagement. Our client contracts are comprised of diverse arrangements involving fees based on any one or a combination of the following: an agreed fee or rate per hour for the level of effort expended by our employees; commissions based on the client’s spending for media purchased from third parties; qualitative or quantitative incentive provisions specified in the contract; and reimbursement for third-party costs that we are required to include in revenue when we control the vendor services related to such costs and we act as principal. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price and is recognized as revenue when, or as, the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation. Clients typically receive and consume the benefit of our services as they are performed. Substantially all our client contracts provide that we are compensated for services performed to date and allow for cancellation by either party on short notice, typically 90 days, without penalty.\nGenerally, our short-term contracts, which normally take 30 to 90 days to complete, are performed by a single agency and consist of a single performance obligation. As a result, we do not consider the underlying services as separate or distinct performance obligations because our services are highly interrelated, occur in close proximity, and the integration of the various components of a marketing message is essential to overall service. In certain of our long-term client contracts, which have a term of up to one year, the performance obligation is a stand-ready obligation, because we provide a constant level of similar services over the term of the contract. In other long-term contracts, when our services are not a stand-ready obligation, we consider our services distinct performance obligations and allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation based on its stand-alone selling price, including contracts for strategic media planning and buying services, which are considered to be multiple performance obligations, and we allocate the transaction price to each distinct service based on the staffing plan and the stand-alone selling price. In substantially all of our creative services contracts, we have distinct performance obligations for our services, including certain creative services contracts where we act as an agent and arrange, at the client’s direction, for third parties to perform studio production efforts.\nRevenue Recognition Methods.\n A substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over time, as the services are performed, because the client receives and consumes the benefit of our performance throughout the contract period, or we create an asset with no alternative use and are contractually entitled to payment for our performance to date in the event the client terminates the contract for convenience. For these client contracts, other than when we have a stand-ready obligation to perform services, revenue is recognized over time using input measures that correspond to the level of staff effort expended to satisfy the performance obligation on a rate per hour or equivalent basis. For client contracts when we have a stand-ready obligation to perform services on an ongoing basis over the life of the contract, typically for periods up to one year, where the scope of these arrangements is broad and there are no significant gaps in performing the services, we recognize revenue using a time-based measure resulting in a straight-line revenue recognition. From time to time, there may be changes in the client service requirements during the term of a contract and the changes could be significant. These changes are typically negotiated as new contracts covering the additional requirements and the associated costs, as well as additional fees for the incremental work to be performed.\nTo a lesser extent, for certain other contracts where our performance obligations are satisfied in phases, we recognize revenue over time using certain output measures based on the measurement of the value transferred to the customer, including milestones achieved. Where the transaction price or a portion of the transaction price is derived from commissions based on a percentage of purchased media from third parties, the performance obligation is not satisfied until the media is run and we have an enforceable contract providing a right to payment. Accordingly, revenue for commissions is recognized at a point in time, typically when the media is run, including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor.\nPrincipal vs. Agent. \nIn substantially all our businesses, we incur third-party costs on behalf of clients, including direct costs and incidental, or out-of-pocket costs. Third-party direct costs incurred in connection with the creation and delivery of advertising, marketing, and communications services include, among others: purchased media, studio production services, specialized talent, including artists and other freelance labor, event marketing supplies, materials and services, promotional items, market research and third-party data and other related expenditures. Out-of-pocket costs include, among others: transportation, hotel, meals, shipping and telecommunication charges incurred by us in the course of providing our services. Billings related to out-of-pocket costs are included in revenue since we control the goods or services prior to delivery to the client.\n18\nHowever, the inclusion of billings related to third-party direct costs in revenue depends on whether we act as a principal or as an agent in the client arrangement. In most of our businesses, including advertising, which also includes studio production efforts and media planning and buying services, precision marketing, public relations, healthcare, and branding and retail commerce, we act as an agent and arrange, at the client’s direction, for third parties to perform certain services. In these cases, we do not control the goods or services prior to the transfer to the client. As a result, revenue is recorded net of these costs, equal to the amount retained for our fee or commission.\nIn certain businesses, we may act as principal when contracting for third-party services on behalf of our clients. In our experiential business and most of our execution and support businesses, including field marketing and certain specialty marketing businesses, we act as principal because we control the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the client and we are responsible for providing the specified goods or services, or we are responsible for directing and integrating third-party vendors to fulfill our performance obligation at the agreed upon contractual price. In such arrangements, we also take pricing risk under the terms of the client contract. In certain media buying businesses, we act as principal when we control the buying process for the purchase of the media and contract directly with the media vendor. In these arrangements, we assume the pricing risk under the terms of the client contract. When we act as principal, we include billable amounts related to third-party costs in the transaction price and record revenue over time at the gross amount billed, including out-of-pocket costs, consistent with the manner that we recognize revenue for the underlying services contract. However, in media buying contracts where we act as principal, we recognize revenue at a point in time, typically when the media is run, including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client or media vendor.\nVariable Consideration. \nSome\n \nof our client arrangements include variable consideration provisions, which include performance incentives, tiered commission structures and vendor rebates in certain markets outside of the United States. Variable consideration is estimated and included in total consideration at contract inception based on either the expected value method or the most likely outcome method. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and other factors known at the time. Performance incentives are typically recognized in revenue over time. Variable consideration for our media businesses in certain international markets includes rebate revenue and is recognized when it is probable that the media will be run, including when it is not subject to cancellation by the client. In addition, when we receive rebates or credits from vendors for transactions entered into on behalf of clients, they are remitted to the clients in accordance with contractual requirements or retained by us based on the terms of the client contract or local law. Amounts passed on to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned, typically when the media is run.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Notes 1 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the adoption of new accounting standards and accounting standards not yet adopted.\n19\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe year-over-year change in results of operations:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$ Change\n$ Change\nRevenue\n$\n15,689.1\n$\n14,692.2\n$\n14,289.1\n$\n996.9\n$\n403.1 \nOperating Expenses:\nSalary and service costs\n11,432.5\n10,701.2\n10,325.9\n731.3\n375.3\nOccupancy and other costs\n1,274.4\n1,168.8\n1,168.6\n105.6\n0.2\nReal estate and other repositioning costs\n2\n57.8\n191.5\n—\n(133.7)\n191.5\nCharges arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine\n3\n—\n—\n113.4\n—\n(113.4)\nGain on disposition of subsidiary\n2\n—\n(78.8)\n—\n78.8\n(78.8)\nCost of services\n12,764.7\n11,982.7\n11,607.9\n782.0\n374.8\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n2\n408.1\n393.7\n378.5\n14.4\n15.2\nDepreciation and amortization\n241.7\n211.1\n219.4\n30.6\n(8.3)\nTotal operating expenses\n13,414.5\n12,587.5\n12,205.8\n827.0\n381.7\nOperating Income\n2,274.6\n2,104.7\n2,083.3\n169.9\n21.4\nInterest Expense\n247.9\n218.5\n208.6\n29.4\n9.9\nInterest Income\n100.9\n106.7\n70.7\n(5.8)\n36.0\nIncome Before Income Taxes and Income From Equity\n   Method Investments\n2,127.6\n1,992.9\n1,945.4\n134.7\n47.5\nIncome Tax Expense\n560.5\n524.9\n546.8\n35.6\n(21.9)\nIncome From Equity Method Investments\n6.9\n5.2\n5.2\n1.7\n—\nNet Income\n1,574.0\n1,473.2\n1,403.8\n100.8\n69.4\nNet Income Attributed To Noncontrolling Interests\n93.4\n81.8\n87.3\n11.6\n(5.5)\nNet Income - Omnicom Group Inc.\n2,3\n$\n1,480.6\n$\n1,391.4\n$\n1,316.5\n$\n89.2\n$\n74.9\nNet Income Per Share - Omnicom Group Inc.:\nBasic\n$\n7.54\n$\n6.98\n$\n6.40\n$\n0.56\n$\n0.58\nDiluted\n2,3\n$\n7.46\n$\n6.91\n$\n6.36\n$\n0.55\n$\n0.55\nRevenue\n$\n15,689.1\n$\n14,692.2\n$\n14,289.1\n$\n996.9\n$\n403.1\nOperating Margin %\n14.5\n \n%\n14.3 \n%\n14.6 \n%\n0.2 \n%\n(0.3)\n%\nEBITA\n1,4\n$\n2,362.1\n$\n2,166.5\n$\n2,142.1\n$\n195.6\n$\n24.4\nEBITA Margin %\n15.1\n \n%\n14.7 \n%\n15.0 \n%\n0.4 \n%\n(0.3)\n%\n1) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page \n30\n.\n2) In 2024, operating expenses included $57.8 million ($42.9 million after-tax) of repositioning costs, primarily related to severance, recorded in the second quarter of 2024 (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). Included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2024 are acquisition transaction costs of $14.6 million ($13.1 million after-tax), related to the proposed merger with IPG (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The net impact of these items reduced operating income for 2024 by $72.4 million ($56.0 million after-tax) and reduced diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. by $0.28. \nIn 2023, operating expenses included real estate operating lease impairment charges, severance and other exit costs of $191.5 million ($145.5 million after-tax) related to repositioning actions we took in the first and second quarters of 2023 to reduce our real estate requirements, rebalance our workforce, and consolidate operations in certain markets. In addition, in the second quarter of 2023, we recorded a gain of $78.8 million ($55.9 million after-tax) on the disposition of certain of our research businesses in the Execution & Support discipline. Included in the fourth quarter of 2023 within selling, general and administrative expenses are acquisition transaction costs of $14.5 million ($13.0 million after-tax), primarily related to the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024 (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). The net impact of these items reduced operating income for 2023 by $127.2 million ($102.6 million after-tax) and reduced diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. by $0.50 (see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements). \n 3) For the year ended December 31, 2022, operating expenses included $113.4 million of charges recorded in the first quarter of 2022, as well as an additional net income tax charge of $4.8 million, related to the disposition of our businesses in Russia, which reduced net income - Omnicom Group Inc. by $118.2 million and diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. by $0.57 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).\n4) \n Beginning in 2024, EBITA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes and amortization of acquired intangible assets and internally developed strategic platform assets. As a result, we reclassified the prior year to be consistent with the revised definition, which reduced EBITA from previously reported amounts. We believe EBITA is useful in evaluating the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets \n20\nand internally developed strategic platform assets on operating performance and allows for comparability between reporting periods. The after-tax impact on diluted net income per share- Omnicom Group Inc. for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $0.32, $0.23 and $0.21, respectively.\nRevenue\nThe components of year-over-year revenue change in the United States (“Domestic”) and the remainder of the world (“International”):\nTotal\nDomestic\nInternational\n$\n%\n$\n%\n$\n%\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n$\n14,692.2 \n$\n7,471.6 \n$\n7,220.6 \nComponents of revenue change:\nForeign exchange rate impact\n(65.5)\n(0.4)\n%\n— \n— \n%\n(65.5)\n(0.9)\n%\nAcquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue\n293.7 \n2.0 \n%\n205.3 \n2.7 \n%\n88.4 \n1.2 \n%\nOrganic growth\n768.7 \n5.2 \n%\n509.6 \n6.8 \n%\n259.1 \n3.6 \n%\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n$\n15,689.1\n \n6.8\n \n%\n$\n8,186.5\n \n9.6\n \n%\n$\n7,502.6\n \n3.9\n \n%\nTotal\nDomestic\nInternational\n$\n%\n$\n%\n$\n%\n Year Ended December 31, 2022\n$\n14,289.1 \n$\n7,367.3 \n$\n6,921.8 \nComponents of revenue change:\nForeign exchange rate impact\n(28.3)\n(0.2)\n%\n— \n— \n%\n(28.3)\n(0.4)\n%\nAcquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue\n(153.1)\n(1.1)\n%\n(87.2)\n(1.2)\n%\n(65.9)\n(1.0)\n%\nOrganic growth\n584.5 \n4.1 \n%\n191.5 \n2.6 \n%\n393.0 \n5.7 \n%\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n$\n14,692.2 \n2.8 \n%\n$\n7,471.6 \n1.4 \n%\n$\n7,220.6 \n4.3 \n%\nThe components and percentages are calculated as follows:\n•\nForeign exchange rate impact is calculated by translating the current period’s local currency revenue using the prior period average exchange rates to derive current period constant currency revenue (in this case $15,754.6 million and $14,720.5 million for the Total column for December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively). The foreign exchange impact is the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current period constant currency revenue ($15,689.1 million less $15,754.6 million and $14,692.2 million less $14,720.5 million for the Total column for December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively).\n•\nAcquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date. As a result, acquisition revenue excludes the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition is attributed to organic growth. Disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of dispositions through the disposition date. The acquisition revenue and disposition revenue amounts are netted in the table.\n•\nOrganic growth is calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact, and the acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue components from total revenue growth.\n•\nThe percentage change is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component ($14,692.2 million and $14,289.1 million for the Total column for December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively).\nChanges in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar affect our results of operations and financial condition. For the most part, because the revenue and expense of our foreign operations are both denominated in the same local currency, the economic impact on operating margin is minimized. Assuming exchange rates at January 30, 2025, remain unchanged, we expect the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates to reduce revenue between 2.0% to 2.5% for the first quarter of 2025 and by 2.0% for the full year. Based on our acquisition and disposition activity to date, excluding the proposed merger with IPG, we expect that the net impact will be flat for the first quarter and for the full year of 2025.\nIn the normal course of business, our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year due to a variety of factors. Under our client-centric approach, we seek to broaden our relationships with all of our clients. Our largest client represented approximately 2.7% and 3.0% of revenue for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our ten largest and 100 largest clients represented approximately 19.1% and 54.4% of revenue for 2024, respectively, and 20.2% and 54.5% of revenue for 2023, respectively.\n21\nRevenue by Discipline\nTo monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients, we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following categories: Media & Advertising, Precision Marketing, Public Relations, Healthcare, Branding & Retail Commerce, Experiential and Execution & Support,\nThe  year-over-year change in revenue and organic growth by discipline:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024 vs. 2023\n$\n% of\nRevenue\n$\n% of\nRevenue\n$ Change\n% Organic Growth\nMedia & Advertising\n$\n8,466.2\n \n54.0\n \n%\n$\n7,891.2 \n53.7 \n%\n$\n575.0 \n7.8 \n%\nPrecision Marketing\n1,820.9\n \n11.6\n \n%\n1,473.5 \n10.0 \n%\n347.4 \n3.8 \n%\nPublic Relations\n1,679.2\n \n10.7\n \n%\n1,578.9 \n10.7 \n%\n100.3 \n3.7 \n%\nHealthcare\n1,354.7\n \n8.5\n \n%\n1,362.7 \n9.4 \n%\n(8.0)\n(0.4)\n%\nBranding & Retail Commerce\n792.9\n \n5.1\n \n%\n853.7 \n5.8 \n%\n(60.8)\n(6.2)\n%\nExperiential\n731.5\n \n4.7\n \n%\n651.4 \n4.4 \n%\n80.1 \n15.4 \n%\nExecution & Support\n843.7\n \n5.4\n \n%\n880.8 \n6.0 \n%\n(37.1)\n(0.5)\n%\nRevenue\n$\n15,689.1\n \n$\n14,692.2 \n$\n996.9 \n5.2 \n%\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\n2022\n2023 vs. 2022\n$\n% of\nRevenue\n$\n% of\nRevenue\n$ Change\n% Organic Growth\nMedia & Advertising\n$\n7,891.2 \n53.7 \n%\n$\n7,433.9 \n52.0 \n%\n$\n457.3 \n6.5 \n%\nPrecision Marketing\n1,473.5 \n10.0 \n%\n1,426.6 \n10.0 \n%\n46.9 \n3.1 \n%\nPublic Relations\n1,578.9 \n10.7 \n%\n1,552.7 \n10.9 \n%\n26.2 \n(0.8)\n%\nHealthcare\n1,362.7 \n9.4 \n%\n1,322.3 \n9.3 \n%\n40.4 \n3.8 \n%\nBranding & Retail Commerce\n853.7 \n5.8 \n%\n848.1 \n5.9 \n%\n5.6 \n1.2 \n%\nExperiential\n651.4 \n4.4 \n%\n635.6 \n4.4 \n%\n15.8 \n3.0 \n%\nExecution & Support\n880.8 \n6.0 \n%\n1,069.9 \n7.5 \n%\n(189.1)\n(1.0)\n%\nRevenue\n$\n14,692.2 \n$\n14,289.1 \n$\n403.1 \n4.1 \n%\nEffective January 1, 2023, we realigned the classification of certain services primarily within our Commerce & Branding, Execution & Support, and Experiential disciplines, and prior year amounts have been reclassified.\n2024 v. 2023\nThe year-over-year changes in worldwide revenue in 2024, compared to 2023, in our fundamental disciplines were: Media & Advertising increased $575.0 million, Precision Marketing increased $347.4 million, Public Relations increased $100.3 million, Healthcare decreased $8.0 million, Branding & Retail Commerce decreased $60.8 million, Experiential increased $80.1 million, and Execution & Support decreased $37.1 million. Worldwide organic revenue growth increased revenue $768.7 million, or 5.2%, primarily reflecting increased client spending in Media & Advertising, led by Media, as well as Precision Marketing, Public Relations and Experiential disciplines compared to the prior year. Our Public Relations discipline was helped by spending on the U.S. elections, and the Experiential discipline benefited from spending on the Summer Olympics. Organic growth was partially offset by underperformance in our Branding & Retail Commerce discipline. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue slightly. The decrease in revenue from foreign exchange translation was primarily related to the weakening of some currencies, including the Japanese Yen and Brazilian Real against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the British Pound, Colombian Peso and Euro against the U.S. Dollar. Acquisition revenue, net of dispositions, increased revenue $293.7 million, or 2.0% (see Notes 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements).\n2023 v. 2022\nThe year-over-year changes in worldwide revenue in 2023, compared to 2022, in our fundamental disciplines were: Media & Advertising increased $457.3 million, Precision Marketing increased $46.9 million, Public Relations increased $26.2 million, Healthcare increased $40.4 million, Branding & Retail Commerce increased $5.6 million, Experiential increased $15.8 million, and Execution & Support decreased $189.1 million. Organic revenue increased across substantially all disciplines, except for Public Relations, which faced a difficult comparison to the prior year, and Execution & Support. The impact of foreign exchange translation slightly reduced our revenue. The decrease in revenue from foreign exchange translation was primarily related to the weakening of several currencies against the U.S. Dollar, including the Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen, and \n22\nChinese Renminbi, partially offset by the Euro and British Pound, which strengthened against the U.S. Dollar compared to the  prior year. The negative impact on revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, year-over-year was primarily due to dispositions in the Execution & Support discipline in the first and second quarters of 2023, including the sale of our research businesses, as well as the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by acquisitions in our Media & Advertising and Public Relations disciplines in 2023.\n Revenue by Geography\nThe year-over-year change in revenue and organic growth in our geographic markets:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024 vs. 2023\n$\n% of\nRevenue\n$\n% of\nRevenue\n$ Change\n% Organic Growth\nAmericas:\nNorth America\n$\n8,650.2\n \n55.2\n \n%\n$\n7,951.0 \n54.2 \n%\n$\n699.2 \n6.3 \n%\nLatin America\n433.7\n \n2.8\n \n%\n386.8 \n2.6 \n%\n46.9 \n17.2 \n%\nEMEA:\nEurope\n4,439.0\n \n28.2\n \n%\n4,266.9 \n29.0 \n%\n172.1 \n2.7 \n%\nMiddle East and Africa\n319.2\n \n2.0\n \n%\n309.6 \n2.1 \n%\n9.6 \n5.2 \n%\nAsia-Pacific\n1,847.0\n \n11.8\n \n%\n1,777.9 \n12.1 \n%\n69.1 \n3.8 \n%\nRevenue\n$\n15,689.1\n \n$\n14,692.2 \n$\n996.9 \n5.2 \n%\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\n2022\n2023 vs. 2022\n$\n% of\nRevenue\n$\n% of\nRevenue\n$ Change\n% Organic Growth\nAmericas:\nNorth America\n$\n7,951.0 \n54.2 \n%\n$\n7,856.0 \n55.0 \n%\n$\n95.0 \n2.6 \n%\nLatin America\n386.8 \n2.6 \n%\n329.0 \n2.3 \n%\n57.8 \n13.0 \n%\nEMEA:\nEurope\n4,266.9 \n29.0 \n%\n4,010.5 \n28.1 \n%\n256.4 \n6.2 \n%\nMiddle East and Africa\n309.6 \n2.1 \n%\n346.7 \n2.4 \n%\n(37.1)\n(5.8)\n%\nAsia-Pacific\n1,777.9 \n12.1 \n%\n1,746.9 \n12.2 \n%\n31.0 \n6.0 \n%\nRevenue\n$\n14,692.2 \n$\n14,289.1 \n$\n403.1 \n4.1 \n%\nThe year-over-year increase in worldwide revenue across our geographic markets for 2024 were: North America $699.2 million, or 8.8%, Latin America $46.9 million, or 12.1%, Europe $172.1 million, or 4.0%, the Middle East and Africa $9.6 million, or 3.1%, and Asia-Pacific $69.1 million, or 3.9%.\nThe year-over-year change in worldwide revenue across our geographic markets for 2023 was: North America increased $95.0 million, or 1.2%, Latin America increased $57.8 million, or 17.6%, Europe increased $256.4 million, or 6.4%, the Middle East and Africa decreased $37.1 million, or 10.7%, and Asia-Pacific increased $31.0 million, or 1.8%.\nNorth America\n2024 vs. 2023\nIn North America, organic revenue growth in 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by strong performance in the United States, especially in the Media & Advertising discipline, led by our media business, and our Precision Marketing, Experiential, and Public Relations disciplines. Our Public Relations discipline was helped by spending on the U.S. elections, and the Experiential discipline benefited from spending on the Summer Olympics. The organic growth was partially offset by underperformance in our Branding & Retail Commerce, Execution & Support and Healthcare disciplines. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, positively impacted revenue and were primarily related to the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024 and acquisitions in the second half of 2023 in our Public Relations discipline, partially offset by dispositions in the Execution & Support discipline in the first half of 2023. \n23\n2023 vs. 2022\nIn 2023, North America’s organic revenue growth was driven primarily by the performance in the United States, especially in the Media & Advertising discipline, led by our media business, and our Precision Marketing, and Healthcare disciplines, partially offset by negative performance in our Experiential and Branding & Retail Commerce disciplines, which faced difficult comparisons to the prior year, and our Execution & Support discipline. Acquisitions, net of dispositions, negatively impacted revenue, primarily as a result of dispositions in the Execution & Support discipline in the first and second quarters of 2023, including the sale of our research businesses, partially offset by acquisitions during the year in the Media & Advertising, Precision Marketing, and Public Relations disciplines. \nLatin America\n2024 vs. 2023\nIn Latin America, organic revenue growth in 2024 compared to the prior year, increased in all disciplines, led by Media & Advertising, and in all countries in the region. The weakening of most currencies against the U.S. Dollar decreased revenue in 2024, compared to 2023. Acquisitions positively impacted revenue and were primarily related to acquisition activity in our Media & Advertising discipline in the prior year and the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024.\n2033 vs. 2022\nIn Latin America, organic revenue growth in 2023 increased in all our disciplines, led by our Media & Advertising discipline, and in substantially all countries in the region. The strengthening of most currencies, especially the Mexican Peso and Brazilian Real, partially offset by the weakening of the Argentine Peso against the U.S. Dollar, increased revenue in 2023 compared to 2022.\nEMEA\nEurope\n2024 vs. 2023\nIn Europe, organic revenue growth in 2024 compared to the prior year was driven by strong performance in our Media & Advertising discipline, led by our media business, and in our Experiential and Execution & Support disciplines, partially offset by underperformance in our Precision Marketing, Branding & Retail Commerce and Public Relations disciplines. Foreign currency exchange rate changes increased revenue year-over-year, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the British Pound, partially offset by the weakening of several currencies against the U.S. Dollar year-over-year. Acquisitions, net of dispositions for 2024, positively impacted revenue and were primarily related to the purchase of Flywheel Digital in January 2024 and acquisition activity in our Media & Advertising discipline in the second half of 2023, partially offset by dispositions in the Execution & Support discipline in the first half of 2023. In 2024, total revenue in the U.K. increased 7.1% to $1,700.5 million. Organic revenue growth year-over-year in the U.K. was 2.7%, with growth led by our media business in our Media & Advertising discipline and our Experiential and Execution & Support disciples, partially offset by negative performance in our Precision Marketing, Branding & Retail Commerce, and Public Relations disciplines. In Continental Europe, which includes the Euro Zone and the other European countries, organic growth year-over-year of 2.8% was across substantially all disciplines, led by Turkey, Spain, Germany and Netherlands, and was partially offset by weakness in France and Italy.\n2023 vs. 2022\nIn Europe for 2023 compared to 2022, organic revenue increased across most countries in our major markets and in substantially all disciplines, especially our Media & Advertising discipline, led by our media business, and our Experiential discipline, partially offset by a decrease in our Public Relations discipline. Foreign currency changes increased revenue in 2023, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Euro and British Pound against the U.S. Dollar year-over-year. Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, reduced revenue compared to the prior year, primarily due to the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022 and the disposition of certain businesses, primarily our research businesses in the Execution & Support discipline in the second quarter of 2023. In 2023, total revenue in the U.K. increased 4.0% to $1,587.3 million. Organic revenue growth year-over-year in the U.K. was 4.7%, with growth across most disciplines, led by our media business in our Media & Advertising discipline, partially offset by negative performance in our Precision Marketing and Public Relations disciplines.

For 2024, the strengthening of certain currencies in the region against the U.S. Dollar decreased revenue year-over-year. For 2023, organic revenue decreased compared to 2022, primarily as a result of our Experiential discipline, which faced difficult comparisons in the region, partially offset by our Media & Advertising discipline. In 2023 as compared to 2022, the weakening of certain currencies in the region against the U.S. Dollar also decreased revenue year-over-year.\n24\nAsia-Pacific\n2024 vs. 2023\nIn Asia-Pacific, during 2024, organic revenue increased compared to 2023. Organic growth in our Media & Advertising discipline was partially offset by underperformance in our Precision Marketing and Public Relations disciplines. Substantially all markets in the region, especially China, India, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand, had positive organic revenue growth as compared to the prior year. Foreign currency changes decreased revenue for the year, primarily as a result of the weakening of the Japanese Yen and Chinese Reminbi against the U.S. Dollar.

As a service business, salary and service costs make up the significant portion of our operating expenses and substantially all these costs comprise the essential components directly linked to the delivery of our services. Salary and service costs include employee compensation and benefits, freelance labor, third-party service costs, and third-party incidental costs. Third-party service costs include vendor costs when we act as principal in providing services to our clients. Third-party incidental costs that are required to be included in revenue primarily consist of client-related travel and incidental out-of-pocket costs that are billed back to the client directly at our cost. Occupancy and other costs consist of the indirect costs related to the delivery of our services, including office rent and other occupancy costs, equipment rent, technology costs, general office expenses and other expenses. Adverse and beneficial fluctuations in foreign currencies from year-over-year impact our results of operations and financial condition when we translate our financial statements from local foreign currencies to the U.S. Dollar. However, substantially all of our foreign operations transact business in their local currency, mitigating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our \n26\noperating margin percentage. As a result, the changes in our operating expenses year-over-year from foreign currency translation were in line with the percentage impact from changes in foreign currencies on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n2024 vs. 2023\nOperating expenses in 2024 increased $827.0 million, or 6.6%, to $13,414.5 million from $12,587.5 million, compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of organic growth and the acquisition of Flywheel in the first quarter of 2024 (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). Operating expenses for 2024 include the impact of repositioning costs, primarily related to severance, recorded in the second quarter of 2024 for $57.8 million in connection with our strategic initiatives to increase efficiencies in our international operations and the start of the consolidation of our production services (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements).  Included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2024 are acquisition transaction costs of $14.6 million ($13.1 million after-tax) related to the proposed merger with IPG (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n2023 vs. 2022\nOperating expenses in 2023 increased $381.7 million, or 3.1%, to $12,587.5 million from $12,205.8 million. Operating expenses for 2023 reflect the net impact of the gain on disposition of certain research businesses in our Execution & Support discipline of $78.8 million, repositioning costs related to real estate and other exit charges and severance costs of $191.5 million (see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements) and acquisition transaction costs of $14.5 million, primarily related to the Flywheel Digital acquisition that closed in January 2024.\nOperating Expenses - Salary and Service Costs\nSalary and service costs, which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue, are comprised of salary and related costs, third-party service costs, and third-party incidental costs.\n2024 vs. 2023\nSalary and service costs for 2024 increased $731.3 million, or 6.8%, to $11,432.5 million, compared to the prior year. Salary and related costs for 2024 increased $228.6 million, or 3.2%, to $7,441.4 million, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Flywheel Digital. These costs decreased as a percentage of revenue, primarily due to the reduction in headcount arising from our ongoing repositioning actions and changes in our global employee mix. Third-party service costs for 2024 increased $430.7 million, or 14.8%, to $3,348.6 million, primarily as a result of organic growth in our Media & Advertising and Experiential disciplines. Third-party incidental costs for 2024 increased $72.0 million, or 12.6%, to $642.5 million.\n2023 vs. 2022\nSalary and service costs in 2023 compared to the prior year period increased $375.3 million, or 3.6% to $10,701.2 million. Salary and related costs for 2023 increased $14.9 million, or 0.2%, to $7,212.8 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount. Headcount increased in 2023 as a result of organic growth and our acquisition activity; the increase was partially offset by the dispositions in our Execution & Support discipline in the first and second quarters of 2023. Third-party service costs for 2023 increased $332.4 million, or 12.9%, to $2,917.9 million due to changes in the mix of our businesses year-over-year, and were less impacted by the effects of our disposition activity during the year. Third-party incidental costs for 2023 increased $28.0 million, or 5.2%, to $570.5 million. \nOperating Expenses - Occupancy and Other Costs\nOccupancy and other costs are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs. \n2024 vs. 2023\nOccupancy and other costs for 2024, increased by $105.6 million, or 9.0%, year-over-year to $1,274.4 million, primarily resulting from acquisition activity. Increased office and other related costs were partially offset by lower rent expense in the year.\n2023 vs. 2022\nOccupancy and other costs for 2023, increased slightly by $0.2 million year-over-year. Lower rent expense was partially offset by an increase in office and other related costs in the year. In connection with the transition to a flexible working environment, a hybrid model which allows for partial remote work, we took certain actions in the first quarter of 2023 to reduce and reposition our office lease portfolio and recorded a charge of $119.2 million, which included an $80.4 million non-cash impairment charge for operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets, $20.0 million for the write-off of the net book value of leasehold improvements at the affected locations, and $18.8 million of other lease obligations. Substantially all of the operating lease payments related to the ROU assets will be paid out through December 31, 2026 (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements).\n27\nOperating Expenses - Selling, General & Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses primarily consist of third-party marketing costs, professional fees, and compensation and benefits and occupancy and other costs of our corporate and executive offices, including group-wide finance and accounting, treasury, legal and governance, human resource oversight and similar costs.\n2024 vs. 2023\nSG&A expenses for 2024 increased $14.4 million compared to 2023, primarily due to professional fees related to our strategic initiatives. \n \nIncluded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2024 are acquisition transaction costs of $14.6 million ($13.1 million after-tax) related to the proposed merger with IPG (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).\n2023 vs. 2022\nSG&A expenses for 2023 increased $15.2 million compared to 2022, primarily as a result of higher professional fees in connection with our acquisition activity during the year, and acquisition transaction costs of $14.5 million ($13.0 million after-tax), primarily related to the Flywheel Digital acquisition that closed in January 2024.\nOperating Income\n2024 vs. 2023\nOperating income for 2024 increased $169.9 million, or 8.1%, to $2,274.6 million, compared to 2023, and operating margin increased to 14.5% from 14.3%. EBITA increased $195.6 million to $2,362.1 million, and EBITA margin increased to 15.1% from 14.7%. The net effect of repositioning actions, primarily related to severance, recorded in the second quarter of 2024 and acquisition transaction costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024 (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements) reduced both operating income and EBITA by $72.4 million, and reduced both operating margin by 0.5% and EBITA margin by 0.4%. The net effect of the real estate and other repositioning costs, the gain on disposition of subsidiaries (see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements) and acquisition costs, reduced both operating income and EBITA by $127.2 million, and reduced both operating margin and EBITA margin by 0.9% in 2023.\n2023 vs. 2022\nOperating income for 2023 compared to 2022, increased $21.4 million to $2,104.7 million and operating margin decreased to 14.3% from 14.6%. EBITA decreased $24.4 million to $2,166.5 million and EBITA margin decreased to 14.7% from 15.0%. The net effect of the real estate and other repositioning costs, the gain on disposition of subsidiaries (see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements) and acquisition costs, reduced both operating income and EBITA by $127.2 million, and reduced both operating margin and EBITA margin by 0.9%. Operating income and EBITA in 2022 included a reduction of $113.4 million related to charges arising from the war in Ukraine, which decreased both operating margin and EBITA margin by 0.8%.\nNet Interest Expense\n2024 vs. 2023\nNet interest expense in 2024 increased $35.2 million year-over-year to $147.0 million. Interest expense on debt increased by $31.2 million year-over-year, primarily related to the issuance in the first quarter of 2024 of €600 million 3.70% Senior Notes due 2032, or 2032 Notes, and the issuance in the third quarter of 2024 of $600 million 5.30% Senior Notes due 2034, or 2034 Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2032 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2034 Notes, along with available cash, were used to fund the repayment of our $750 million 3.65% Senior Notes on November 1, 2024 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). Interest income in 2024 decreased $5.8 million year-over-year to $100.9 million, primarily as a result of lower cash balances in the first half of the year due to the timing of our financing and acquisition activity, including the purchase of Flywheel in the first quarter of 2024.\n2023 vs. 2022\nNet interest expense in 2023 decreased $26.1 million year-over-year to $111.8 million. Interest expense increased by $9.9 million year-over-year, primarily related to non-cash interest charges on pension and other postemployment benefits (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements). Interest income in 2023 increased $36.0 million year-over-year to 106.7 million, primarily as a result of higher average cash balances.\nIncome Taxes\n2024 vs. 2023\nOur effective tax rate for 2024 remained flat year-over-year at 26.3%. The effective tax rate for 2024 was favorably impacted by the windfall tax benefit on share-based compensation. The effective tax rate for 2023 includes an increase of approximately $10.7 million in income tax expense related to a lower tax benefit in certain jurisdictions for the real estate and other repositioning costs in the period and an increase in the U.K. statutory tax rate, partially offset by approximately $10.0 million of favorable impacts from the resolution of certain non-U.S. tax positions.\n28\n2023 vs. 2022\nOur effective tax rate for 2023 decreased year-over-year to 26.3% from 28.1%. The higher effective tax rate for 2022 was predominantly the result of the non-deductibility of the $113.4 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2022, arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine.\nNumerous foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are in the process of enacting legislation to adopt a minimum effective tax rate described in the Global Anti-Base Erosion, or Pillar Two, model rules issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. A minimum effective tax rate of 15% would apply to multinational companies with consolidated revenue above €750 million.\nUnder the Pillar Two rules, a company would be required to determine a combined effective tax rate for all entities located in a jurisdiction. If the jurisdictional effective tax rate determined under the Pillar Two is less than 15%, a top-up tax will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15%. We are continuing to monitor the pending implementation of Pillar Two by individual countries and the potential effects of Pillar Two on our business. The provisions effective in 2024 did not have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nNet Income and Net Income Per Share - Omnicom Group, Inc.\n2024 vs. 2023\nNet income - Omnicom Group Inc. in 2024 increased $89.2 million to $1,480.6 million from $1,391.4 million. The year-over-year increase is due to the factors described above. Diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. increased to $7.46 in 2024, from $6.91 in 2023, due to the factors described above and the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the repurchases of our common stock, net of shares issued for restricted stock awards, stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan during the year. For 2024, the net impact of the real estate and other repositioning costs, primarily related to severance, recorded in the second quarter of 2024 (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements) and acquisition transaction costs, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024 reduced net income - Omnicom Group Inc. by $56.0 million and diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. by $0.28. \n2023 vs. 2022\n Net income - Omnicom Group Inc. in 2023 increased $74.9 million to $1,391.4 million from $1,316.5 million. The year-over-year increase is due to the factors described above. Diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. decreased to $6.91 in 2023, compared to $6.36 in 2022, due to the factors described above and the impact of the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of our common stock, net of shares issued for restricted stock awards, stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan during the year. For 2023, the net impact of the real estate and other repositioning costs (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements), gain on disposition of subsidiaries (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements) and acquisition transaction costs reduced net income - Omnicom Group Inc. by $102.6 million and diluted net income per share - Omnicom Group Inc. by $0.50. \n29\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nWe use certain non-GAAP financial measures in describing our performance. We use EBITA and EBITA Margin as additional operating performance measures, which exclude from operating income the non-cash amortization expense of acquired intangible assets and internally developed strategic platform assets. We believe EBITA and EBITA Margin are useful measures for investors to evaluate the performance of our business and allow for comparability between the periods presented. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table reconciles the U.S. GAAP financial measure of Net Income - Omnicom Group Inc. to EBITA and EBITA Margin:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet Income - Omnicom Group Inc.\n$\n1,480.6\n$\n1,391.4\n$\n1,316.5\nNet Income Attributed To Noncontrolling Interests\n93.4\n81.8\n87.3\nNet Income\n1,574.0\n1,473.2\n1,403.8\nIncome From Equity Method Investments\n6.9\n5.2\n5.2\nIncome Tax Expense\n560.5\n524.9\n546.8\nIncome Before Income Taxes and Income From Equity Method Investments\n2,127.6\n1,992.9\n1,945.4\nInterest Expense\n247.9\n218.5\n208.6\nInterest Income\n100.9\n106.7\n70.7\nOperating Income\n2,274.6\n2,104.7\n2,083.3\nAdd back: Amortization of acquired intangible assets and\n   internally developed strategic platform assets\n87.5\n61.8\n58.8\nEarnings before interest, taxes, and amortization of intangible assets (“EBITA”)\n$\n2,362.1\n$\n2,166.5\n$\n2,142.1\nRevenue\n$\n15,689.1\n$\n14,692.2\n$\n14,289.1\nEBITA\n$\n2,362.1\n$\n2,166.5\n$\n2,142.1\nEBITA Margin %\n15.1\n \n%\n14.7 \n%\n15.0 \n%\n30\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Sources and Requirements\nThe primary sources of our short-term liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and cash and cash equivalents. Additional liquidity sources include our $2.5 billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, terminating on June 2, 2028, the ability to issue up to $2 billion of U.S. Dollar denominated commercial paper and issue up to the equivalent of $500 million in British Pounds or Euro under a Euro commercial paper program, and access to the capital markets. In addition, certain of our international subsidiaries have uncommitted credit lines that are guaranteed by Omnicom aggregating $517.4 million. Our liquidity sources fund our non-discretionary cash requirements and our discretionary spending. Our $600 million Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement automatically terminated on July 15, 2024.\nWorking capital, which we define as current assets minus current liabilities, is our principal non-discretionary funding requirement. Our working capital cycle typically peaks during the second quarter of the year due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation, income taxes and contingent purchase price obligations. In addition, we have contractual obligations related to our long-term debt (principal and interest payments), recurring business operations, primarily related to lease obligations, and acquisition related obligations. Our principal discretionary cash spending includes dividend payments to common shareholders, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $92.6 million from December 31, 2023. The decrease was composed of:\nSources  \nNet cash provided by operating activities - as reported\n \n$\n1,733.5 \nAdd back: Decrease in operating capital\n \n231.2 \nPrincipal cash sources\n \n$\n1,964.7 \nUses\nCapital expenditures\n$\n(140.6)\nDividends paid to common shareholders\n(552.7)\nDividends paid to noncontrolling interest shareholders\n(85.4)\nAcquisition payments, including payment of contingent purchase price obligations and acquisition of additional noncontrolling interests\n(998.1)\nRepurchases of common stock, net of proceeds from stock plans\n(268.6)\nPrincipal cash uses\n \n$\n(2,045.4)\nPrincipal cash uses in excess of principal cash sources\n \n$\n(80.7)\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n \n(185.4)\nOther net financing and investing activities\n \n404.7 \nDecrease in operating capital\n \n(231.2)\nDecrease in cash and cash equivalents - as reported\n \n$\n(92.6)\nPrincipal cash sources and principal cash uses are Non-GAAP liquidity measures. These amounts exclude changes in operating capital and other investing and financing activities. This presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to understand the primary sources and uses of our cash flow and the effect on our cash and cash equivalents. Non-GAAP liquidity measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. Additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated statement of cash flows and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAt December 31, 2024, we have the following contractual obligations:\n•\nThe aggregate principal amount of long-term debt is $6.1 billion and matures at various dates from 2026 through 2034. Future interest payments on the debt total $1.0 billion, of which $186.6 million is payable in 2025.\n•\nThe liability for operating and finance lease payments is $1,414.9 million, of which $294.2 million is due in 2025.\n•\nThe obligation for the defined benefit pension plans is $216.0 million, and the liability for the postemployment arrangements is $126.6 million. In 2024, we contributed $10.6 million to the defined benefit plans and paid $11.4 million for the postemployment arrangements. We do not expect these payments to increase significantly in 2025.\n•\nThe liability for contingent purchase price payments (earn-outs) is $220.1 million, of which $56.0 million is payable in 2025.\n•\nThe remaining balance for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings imposed by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 is $41.3 million, of which $34.9 million is payable in 2025.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that net cash provided by operating activities and cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our non-discretionary cash requirements for the next twelve months. In addition, and over the longer term, our Credit Facility is available to fund our working capital and contractual obligations.\n31\nCash Management\nOur regional treasury centers in North America, Europe and Asia manage our cash and liquidity. Each day, operations with excess funds invest those funds with their regional treasury center. Likewise, operations that require funds borrow from their regional treasury center. Treasury centers with excess cash invest on a short-term basis with third parties, with maturities generally ranging from overnight to 90 days. Certain treasury centers have notional pooling arrangements that are used to manage their cash and set-off foreign exchange imbalances. The arrangements require each treasury center to have its own notional pool account and to maintain a notional positive account balance. Additionally, under the terms of the arrangement, set-off of foreign exchange positions are limited to the long and short positions within their own account. To the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity, they can issue up to a total of $2 billion of U.S. Dollar-denominated commercial paper, issue up to the equivalent of $500 million in British Pounds or Euro under a Euro commercial paper program, or borrow under the Credit Facility or the uncommitted credit lines. This process enables us to manage our debt more efficiently and utilize our cash more effectively, as well as manage our risk to foreign exchange rate imbalances. In countries where we either do not conduct treasury operations or it is not feasible for one of our treasury centers to fund net borrowing requirements on an intercompany basis, we arrange for local currency uncommitted credit lines. We have a policy governing counterparty credit risk with financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents, and we have deposit limits for each institution. In countries where we conduct treasury operations, generally the counterparties are either branches or subsidiaries of institutions that are party to the Credit Facility. These institutions generally have credit ratings better than or equal to our credit ratings. In countries where we do not conduct treasury operations, all cash and cash equivalents are held by counterparties that meet specific minimum credit standards.\nAt December 31, 2024, our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $2.0 billion of our total cash and cash equivalents of $4.3 billion. Substantially all of the cash is available to us, net of any foreign withholding taxes payable upon repatriation to the United States.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our net debt position, which we define as total debt, including short-term debt, less cash and cash equivalents increased $498.7 million to $1.7 billion from December 31, 2023. The increase in net debt primarily resulted from our discretionary spending of $2.0 billion, primarily related to our acquisition and other financing activities. This increase was substantially offset by the increase in cash from the net cash provided by operating activities of $1.7 billion. In addition, the net effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and on our foreign currency denominated debt increased net debt by $114 million.\nNet debt:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nShort-term debt\n$\n21.3 \n$\n10.9 \nLong-term debt, including current portion\n6,035.3 \n5,639.6 \nTotal debt\n6,056.6 \n5,650.5 \nLess: Cash and cash equivalents\n4,339.4 \n4,432.0 \nNet debt\n$\n1,717.2 \n$\n1,218.5 \nNet debt is a Non-GAAP liquidity measure. This presentation, together with the comparable U.S. GAAP liquidity measures, reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management. Non-GAAP liquidity measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP liquidity measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.\nDebt Instruments and Related Covenants\nOn August 2, 2024, Omnicom issued $600 million 5.30% Senior Notes due 2034. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $592.4 million. The net proceeds from the issuance, along with available cash, were used to fund the repayment of our $750 million 3.65% Senior Notes on November 1, 2024.\nOn March 6, 2024, Omnicom Finance Holdings plc, or OFH, a U.K.-based wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom, issued  €600 million 3.70% Senior Notes due 2032. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $643.1 million and were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock.\nOur 2.45% Senior Notes due 2030, 4.20% Senior Notes due 2030, 2.60% Senior Notes due 2031 and 5.30% Senior Notes due 2034 are senior unsecured obligations of Omnicom that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness.\n32\nOmnicom and its wholly owned finance subsidiary, Omnicom Capital Inc., or OCI, are co-obligors under the 3.60% Senior Notes due 2026. These notes are a joint and several liability of Omnicom and OCI, and Omnicom unconditionally guarantees OCI’s obligations with respect to the notes. OCI provides funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries. OCI’s assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries, and the related interest receivable. There are no restrictions on the ability of OCI or Omnicom to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends, loans or advances. Such notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness.\nOmnicom and OCI have, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of OFH with respect to the €500 million 0.80% Senior Notes due 2027 and the €500 million 1.40% Senior Notes due 2031, and Omnicom has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of OFH with respect the €600 million 3.70% Senior Notes due 2032, collectively the Euro Notes. OFH’s assets consist of its investments in several wholly owned finance companies that function as treasury centers, providing funding for various operating companies in Europe, Australia and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The finance companies’ assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans that they make or have made to the operating companies in their respective regions and the related interest receivable. There are no restrictions on the ability of Omnicom, OCI or OFH to obtain funds from their subsidiaries through dividends, loans or advances. The Euro Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of OFH and each of Omnicom and OCI, as applicable.\nOmnicom has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of Omnicom Capital Holdings plc, or OCH, a U.K.-based wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom, with respect to the £325 million 2.25% Senior Notes due 2033, or Sterling Notes. OCH’s assets consist of its investments in several wholly owned finance companies that function as treasury centers, providing funding for various operating companies in EMEA, Australia and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The finance companies’ assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and intercompany loans that they make or have made to the operating companies in their respective regions and the related interest receivable. There are no restrictions on the ability of Omnicom or OCH to obtain funds from their subsidiaries through dividends, loans or advances. The Sterling Notes and the related guarantee are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of OCH and Omnicom, respectively.\n The Credit Facility has a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a Leverage Ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash charges) of no more than 3.5 times for the most recently ended 12-month period. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with this covenant as our Leverage Ratio was 2.4 times. The Credit Facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends or repurchase our common stock.\nAt December 31, 2024, our long-term and short-term debt was rated BBB+ and A2 by S&P and Baa1 and P2 by Moody's. Our access to the commercial paper market and the cost of any issuances is affected by market conditions and our credit ratings. The long-term debt indentures and the Credit Facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings.\nCredit Markets and Availability of Credit\nIn light of the uncertainty of future economic conditions, we will continue to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions, and we will manage our discretionary expenditures. We will also continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients. We believe that these actions, in addition to the availability of our Credit Facility, are sufficient to fund our near-term working capital needs and our discretionary spending. Information regarding our Credit Facility is provided in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe have the ability to fund our day-to-day liquidity, including working capital, by issuing commercial paper or borrowing under the Credit Facility. We did not issue commercial paper in 2024. In 2023, we had a maximum of $200 million of commercial paper outstanding during the year, the average amount outstanding was $5.1 million, the average days outstanding were 1.7 days, and the weighted average interest rate was 5.24%. At December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and no outstanding commercial paper issuances. \nWe may issue commercial paper to fund our day-to-day liquidity when needed. However, disruptions in the credit markets may lead to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads. To mitigate any disruption in the credit markets and to fund our liquidity, we may borrow under the Credit Facility or the uncommitted credit lines or access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist. We will continue to monitor closely our liquidity and conditions in the credit markets. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any disruptions in the credit markets. In such circumstances, we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our day-to-day working capital requirements. Such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.\n33",
