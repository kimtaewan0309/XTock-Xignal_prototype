  "item1": "ITEM 1.    BUSINESS\nD.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the United States as measured by number of homes closed. We construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in 126 markets across 36 states. Our common stock is included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NYSE Texas under the ticker symbol “DHI.” Our listing on NYSE Texas became effective in June 2025. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “D.R. Horton,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.\nOur homebuilding business began in 1978 in Fort Worth, Texas, and our common stock has been publicly traded since 1992. We have expanded and diversified our homebuilding operations geographically over the years by investing capital and building teams of people in our existing markets, starting new operations in additional markets and acquiring other homebuilding companies. We have closed more than 1.2 million homes during our 47-year history, and we have been the largest volume homebuilder in the United States every year since 2002.\nOur business operations consist of homebuilding, rental, a majority-owned residential lot development company, financial services and other activities. Homebuilding is our core business, generating 92% of consolidated revenues of $34.3 billion and $36.8 billion in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 90% of consolidated revenues of $35.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Most of our homebuilding revenue is generated from the sale of completed homes and to a lesser extent from the sale of land and lots. Approximately 84% of our home sales revenue in fiscal 2025 was generated from the sale of single-family detached homes, with the remainder from the sale of attached homes, such as townhomes and duplexes. Our product offerings include a broad range of homes for entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury buyers. Our homes generally range in size from 1,000 to 4,000 square feet and in price from $250,000 to more than $1,000,000. For the year ended September 30, 2025, our homebuilding operations closed 84,863 homes with an average closing price of $370,400.\nOur rental segment consists of single-family and multi-family rental operations. The single-family rental operations construct and lease single-family homes within a community and market each community for a bulk sale of rental homes. The multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and sell residential rental properties, the majority of which are apartment communities. For the year ended September 30, 2025, our rental operations closed 3,460 single-family rental homes and 2,947 multi-family rental units.\nAt September 30, 2025, we owned 62% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar), a publicly traded residential lot development company listed on the NYSE and NYSE Texas under the ticker symbol “FOR.” Forestar operates across many of our homebuilding operating markets and is a key part of our homebuilding strategy to maintain relationships with land developers and control a large portion of our land and lot position through land purchase contracts. For the year ended September 30, 2025, Forestar sold 14,240 lots, of which 83% were sold to D.R. Horton.\nOur financial services operations provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our wholly owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuyers and sells substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers after origination. For the year ended September 30, 2025, DHI Mortgage originated or brokered 68,982 mortgage loans. Our wholly owned subsidiary title companies issue title insurance policies and provide examination, underwriting and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers.\nIn addition to our homebuilding, rental, Forestar and financial services operations, we engage in other business activities through our subsidiaries. We conduct insurance-related operations, own water rights and other water-related assets and own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements. The results of these operations are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped together and presented as other.\n1\nTable of \nContents\nAvailable Information\nWe make available, as soon as reasonably practicable, on our website, www.drhorton.com, all of our reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

We believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles, and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business and provide a strong platform for us to consolidate market share.\n2\nTable of \nContents\nWe conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions, states and markets listed below. Our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments, also referred to as reporting regions, which comprise the markets below. Our financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional information regarding segment performance.\nState\nReporting Region/Market\nState\nReporting Region/Market\nState\nReporting Region/Market\nNorthwest Region\nSoutheast Region\nNorth Region\nColorado\nColorado Springs\nAlabama\nBaldwin County\nDelaware\nNorthern Delaware\nDenver\nBirmingham\nSouthern Delaware\nFort Collins\nHuntsville\nIllinois\nChicago\nOregon\nBend\nMobile\nIndiana\nFort Wayne\nEugene/Springfield\nMontgomery\nIndianapolis\nMedford\nTuscaloosa\nNorthwest Indiana\nPortland/Salem\nFlorida\nCape Coral/Fort Myers\nIowa\nDes Moines\nUtah\nSalt Lake City/Provo/Ogden\nDeltona/Daytona Beach\nIowa City/Cedar Rapids\nSt. George\nGainesville\nKansas/Missouri\nKansas City\nWashington\nBremerton\nJacksonville\nKentucky\nLouisville\nCentral Washington\nLakeland\nMaryland\nBaltimore\nKennewick/Pasco/Richland\nMiami/Fort Lauderdale\nEastern Maryland\nSeattle/Tacoma/Everett/Olympia\nOcala\nSuburban Washington, D.C.\nSpokane\nOrlando\nWestern Maryland\nVancouver\nPalm Bay/Melbourne\nMinnesota\nMinneapolis/St. Paul\nPanama City\nNebraska\nOmaha\nSouthwest Region\nPensacola\nNew Jersey\nNorthern New Jersey\nArizona\nPhoenix\nPort St. Lucie\nSouthern New Jersey\nTucson\nTallahassee\nOhio\nCincinnati/Dayton\nCalifornia\nBakersfield\nTampa/Sarasota/Punta Gorda\nColumbus\nBay Area\nWest Palm Beach\nPennsylvania\nCentral Pennsylvania\nFresno/Tulare\nLouisiana\nBaton Rouge\nPhiladelphia\nLos Angeles County\nLake Charles/Lafayette\nPittsburgh\nModesto/Merced/Stockton\nMississippi\nGulf Coast\nVirginia\nNorthern Virginia\nRedding/Chico/Yuba City\nHattiesburg\nRichmond\nRiverside County\nJackson\nVirginia Beach/Williamsburg\nSacramento\nWestern Virginia\nSan Bernardino County\nEast Region\nWest Virginia\nEastern West Virginia\nHawaii\nOahu\nGeorgia\nAtlanta\nNorthern West Virginia\nNevada\nLas Vegas\nAugusta\nWisconsin\nSoutheast Wisconsin\nReno\nCentral Georgia\nNew Mexico\nAlbuquerque\nSavannah/Brunswick\nSanta Fe\nValdosta\nNorth Carolina\nAsheville\nSouth Central Region\nCharlotte\nArkansas\nLittle Rock\nGreensboro/Winston-Salem\nNorthwest Arkansas\nNew Bern/Greenville\nOklahoma\nOklahoma City\nRaleigh/Durham/Fayetteville\nTulsa\nWilmington\nTexas\nAbilene\nSouth Carolina\nCharleston\nAustin\nColumbia\nBeaumont\nGreenville/Spartanburg\nBryan/College Station\nHilton Head\nCorpus Christi\nMyrtle Beach\nDallas\nTennessee\nChattanooga\nEast Texas\nKnoxville\nFort Worth\nMemphis\nHouston\nNashville\nKilleen/Temple/Waco\nNortheast Tennessee\nLubbock\nMidland/Odessa\nNew Braunfels/San Marcos\nSan Antonio\n3\nTable of \nContents\nWhen evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation, we consider local, market-specific factors, including among others:\n•\nEconomic conditions;\n•\nEmployment levels and job growth;\n•\nIncome level of potential homebuyers;\n•\nLocal housing affordability and typical mortgage products utilized;\n•\nDemand for homes at our targeted price points;\n•\nAvailability of land and lots in desirable locations on acceptable terms;\n•\nLand entitlement and development processes;\n•\nAvailability of qualified subcontractors;\n•\nNew and secondary home sales activity;\n•\nCompetition;\n•\nPrevailing housing products, features, cost and pricing; and\n•\nPerformance capabilities of our local management team.\nEconomies of Scale\nWe are the largest homebuilding company in the United States as measured by number of homes closed in fiscal 2025, and we are also one of the largest builders in most of the markets in which we operate. We believe that our national, regional and local scale provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders, such as:\n•\nGreater access to and lower cost of capital due to our balance sheet strength and our lending and capital markets relationships;\n•\nVolume discounts and rebates from national, regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from certain subcontractors; and\n•\nEnhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities, which allows us flexibility to adjust to changes in market conditions and compete effectively across our markets.\nDecentralized Homebuilding Operations\nWe view homebuilding as a local business; therefore, most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers in making operational decisions. We believe that our local management teams, who are familiar with local market conditions, have the best information to make many decisions regarding their operations. At September 30, 2025, we had 92 separate homebuilding operating divisions, many of which operate in more than one market area. Generally, each operating division consists of a division president; a controller and accounting personnel; land entitlement, acquisition and development personnel; a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel; a construction manager and construction superintendents; customer service personnel; a purchasing manager and office staff. Our division presidents receive performance-based compensation for achieving targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions. Following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices.\n4\nTable of \nContents\nOperating Division Responsibilities\nEach homebuilding operating division is responsible for:\n•\nSite selection, which involves\n— A feasibility study;\n— Soil and environmental reviews;\n— Review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements;\n— Review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements and to complete necessary infrastructure; and\n— Financial analysis of the potential project;\n•\nNegotiating lot purchase, land acquisition and related contracts;\n•\nObtaining all necessary land development and home construction approvals;\n•\nSelecting subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;\n•\nSelecting building and architectural plans;\n•\nPlanning and managing home construction schedules;\n•\nDetermining the pricing for each house plan and options in a given community;\n•\nDeveloping and implementing local marketing and sales plans;\n•\nCoordinating all interactions with customers and real estate brokers during the sales, construction and home closing processes; and \n•\nEnsuring the quality and timeliness of post-closing service and warranty repairs provided to customers.\nCentralized Controls\nWe centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices. We have separate homebuilding regional offices, which generally consist of a region president, a chief financial officer, legal counsel and other operational and office support staff. Each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions, including:\n•\nReview and approval of division business plans and budgets;\n•\nReview and approval of all land and lot acquisition contracts;\n•\nReview of all business and financial analysis for potential land and lot inventory investments;\n•\nOversight of land and home inventory levels;\n•\nMonitoring division financial and operating performance; and\n•\nReview of major personnel decisions and division incentive compensation plans.\n5\nTable of \nContents\nOur corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations. The corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions:\n•\nCash management;\n•\nFinancing;\n•\nAllocation of capital;\n•\nIssuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines;\n•\nApproval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;\n•\nMonitoring and analysis of profitability, returns, costs and inventory levels;\n•\nEnvironmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;\n•\nRisk and litigation management;\n•\nTechnology systems to support management of operations, marketing and financial information, including preventing, monitoring and reporting of cybersecurity issues;\n•\nAccounting and management reporting;\n•\nIncome taxes;\n•\nInternal audit;\n•\nPublic financial reporting and investor and media relations;\n•\nAdministration of payroll and employee benefits;\n•\nNegotiation of national purchasing contracts;\n•\nAdministration, reporting and monitoring of customer surveys and resolution of homeowner concerns; and\n•\nApproval of major personnel decisions and management incentive compensation plans.\nLand/Lot Acquisition and Inventory Management\nWe acquire land for use in our operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots. Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests, independent environmental studies, other engineering work and financial analysis. We also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction.\nWe also enter into land/lot contracts, in which we obtain the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development. These contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any pre-acquisition due diligence costs we incur. This enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment, which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership.\n6\nTable of \nContents\nWe attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by:\n•\nControlling our level of inventory investment and managing our supply of land/lots owned and controlled through purchase contracts to match the expected housing demand in each of our operating markets;\n•\nMonitoring local market and demographic trends, housing preferences and related economic developments, including the identification of desirable housing submarkets based on the quality of local schools, new job opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income trends;\n•\nUtilizing land/lot purchase contracts and seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready for home construction, where possible; and\n•\nMonitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes under construction without an executed sales contract) built in each subdivision.\nLand Development and Home Construction\nSubstantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreed-upon price. We employ land development and construction personnel to monitor construction activities, participate in major building decisions, coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our construction personnel interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on post-closing home maintenance.\nOur home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local homebuyers’ expectations for affordability, home size and features, and our local management teams adjust product offerings to meet buyer demand as necessary. In some communities, we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge.\nWe typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials, except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction. Generally, the construction materials used in our operations have been readily available from numerous sources, and we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option. Construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor, materials and supplies, the weather, the size of the home and other factors. We completed the construction of most homes in two to four months in fiscal 2025.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations. We frequently experience delays in receiving the necessary approvals from municipalities or other government agencies, which often delays our anticipated development and construction activities. \nCost Controls\nWe control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently, utilizing common house plans as consistently as possible and obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor. We also negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local, regional and national basis. We monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community, and we review our inventory levels, margins, expenses, profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations.\nWe control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions, monitoring staffing and compensation levels and by applying technology to business processes to improve productivity where practical. We review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices. We also direct most of our promotional activities toward digital marketing initiatives and local real estate brokers, which we believe are efficient uses of our marketing expenditures.\n7\nTable of \nContents\nMarketing and Sales\nWe primarily use the D.R. Horton brand name to market and sell our homes. We offer various floor plans and product types with a primary focus on the first time and first time move-up homebuyer, which account for the majority of our home closings. We also offer entry-level homes for buyers focused on affordability, higher-end move-up and luxury homes and homes for active adult buyers seeking a low-maintenance lifestyle.\nWe market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned sales employees, and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker. We typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision, and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing available floor plans and pricing information, demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options, when available. We train and inform our sales personnel regarding construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans. As market conditions warrant, we may provide potential homebuyers with a variety of incentives to be competitive in a particular market or to attain our targeted sales pace.\nWe market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers digitally, through email, search engine marketing, social media, our company website and other real estate websites. We also use billboards, radio, television and print media and advertising locally as necessary. We attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns. Model homes play an important role in our marketing efforts, and we strive to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes.\nWe build speculative homes in essentially all of our communities, which allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our returns. These homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to homebuyers who are currently renting or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time frame, as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers. We determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors, such as new job growth and relocations, housing demand and supply, seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market. We attempt to maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis.\nSales Contracts and Backlog\nOur sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and communities. Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional deposits if they select options or upgrade features for their homes. Our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a defined period. Our contracts may include other contingencies, such as the sale of the customer’s existing home. We either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.\nSales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. At September 30, 2025, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $4.1 billion (10,785 homes), a decrease of 14% from $4.8 billion (12,180 homes) at September 30, 2024. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $382,000 at September 30, 2025, down from the $391,700 average at September 30, 2024. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, such as those described above, which can result in cancellations. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations of sales contracts were 18% in both fiscal 2025 and 2024.\nThe length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer (closing) is generally from one to three months; therefore, substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at September 30, 2025 are scheduled to close in fiscal 2026.\n8\nTable of \nContents\nCustomer Service and Quality Control\nOur homebuilding operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ post-closing needs. We believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers. We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. The subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are expected to respond to us and the homeowner in a timely manner. In addition, some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home.\nRental Properties\nOur single-family rental operations construct and lease single-family homes within a community and market each community for a bulk sale of rental homes. We sold 3,460 single-family rental homes in fiscal 2025 compared to 3,970 homes in fiscal 2024. Our multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and sell residential rental properties. We primarily focus on constructing garden style apartment communities in high growth suburban markets. We sold 2,947 multi-family rental units in fiscal 2025 compared to 2,202 units in fiscal 2024.\nForestar Residential Lot Development Operations\nWe own approximately 62% of the outstanding shares of Forestar, a publicly traded residential lot development company with operations in 64 markets across 23 states as of September 30, 2025. Forestar is a key part of our strategy to maintain relationships with land developers and to control a large portion of our land and lot position through land purchase contracts. Forestar continues to invest in land acquisition and development to expand its residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform and consolidate market share in the fragmented U.S. lot development industry. Our homebuilding operations acquire finished lots from Forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies. A shared services agreement is in place whereby we provide Forestar certain administrative, compliance, operational and procurement services. As the controlling shareholder, we have significant influence in guiding the strategic direction and operations of Forestar.\nCustomer Mortgage Financing\nWe provide mortgage financing services primarily to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through DHI Mortgage, our wholly owned subsidiary. DHI Mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application, mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient experience for our homebuyers. During fiscal 2025, DHI Mortgage provided mortgage financing services for 81% of the homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and those loans accounted for substantially all of DHI Mortgage’s total loan volume. Our homebuilding divisions may also work with additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers.\nTo limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations, DHI Mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to third-party purchasers of mortgage loans, the majority of which are eligible for sale to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). DHI Mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers after origination. DHI Mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions, including those related to loan underwriting, quality control, regulatory compliance, secondary marketing of loans, hedging activities, accounting and financial reporting.\nTitle Services\nThrough our subsidiary title companies, we issue title insurance policies and provide examination, underwriting and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers in many of our markets.\n9\nTable of \nContents\nHuman Capital Resources\nPeople and Culture\nAs of September 30, 2025, we employed 14,341 people, of whom 9,972 work in our homebuilding operations, 2,967 in our financial services operations, 586 at our corporate office, 330 in our rental operations, 433 at Forestar and 53 in our other businesses. Of our homebuilding employees, 3,626 are involved in construction, 2,935 are sales and marketing personnel and 3,411 are office personnel.\nWe believe the people who work for our company are our most important resource and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. Our people are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must certify annually to their understanding of and adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required internal training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of discrimination.\nRecruitment, Development and Retention\nWe are committed to hiring, developing and supporting an energetic workforce and maintaining a productive, positive and inclusive workplace. We believe that when people feel included and have ample opportunities for professional growth, they bring forward a variety of perspectives and ideas that strengthen our company. We have an active recruiting team that partners with college campuses and external organizations to identify promising new talent and established professionals. Through our paid internship program, college students and recent graduates gain valuable experience working alongside some of the most experienced professionals in the homebuilding industry. Our management team also supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions. We believe this provides long-term focus and continuity to our operations while also providing opportunities for the growth and advancement of our employees. We regularly conduct specialized training for employees within key business functions of our homebuilding operations, such as purchasing, construction, sales and financial management. Additionally, our Leadership Development Program provides internal training designed to equip future leaders for roles across all areas of our operations. During fiscal 2025, 18 people were placed into a new homebuilding market leadership position, and 100% of those were promoted from within the company.\nThe long-term retention of our employees provides us with an experienced, cohesive workforce, which has been vital to achieving our goals. Our focus on retention is evident in the length of service of our executive, regional and divisional management teams. The average tenure of our executive team is 28 years, our homebuilding region presidents and vice presidents is 20 years and our homebuilding division presidents and city managers is 15 years. Our Board of Directors (Board) is actively involved in our company’s executive leadership succession planning and is equally committed to our culture of promoting rising talent from within.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry. In addition to base pay, eligible employees may participate in our incentive bonus and stock compensation plans, which align their compensation to the interests of our shareholders. A substantial portion of our executive and senior operating leadership’s total compensation is variable, at risk pay based on our company’s performance. We also offer our employees a broad range of benefits, including paid vacation, holidays, sick time and parental leave; medical, dental and vision healthcare insurance; and life insurance and disability coverage. Additional benefits offered include a 401(k) savings plan, employee stock purchase plan and access to professional resources to support employees with their mental and physical health, family and financial planning, identity theft protection and legal needs. We host events and challenges, both virtually and in person, to encourage our employees to stay active and healthy. We are committed to supporting our employees in their health, wellness and financial planning goals. Additional information about our compensation and employee benefit plans is included in Note K to the accompanying financial statements.\n10\nTable of \nContents\nWorkplace Safety and Wellness\nThe safety and well-being of our employees is our first priority. We take workplace safety seriously at our construction sites and in our offices. We provide third-party training for our field personnel to become certified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We also provide our teams with many safety resources, including safety checklists, policies, procedures and best practices, and we communicate with all employees through a monthly safety newsletter to inform and reinforce our commitment to and concern for their well-being. Additionally, because substantially all land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors, we require that our subcontractors maintain safety programs as well.\nAdditional information regarding human capital is available in the “Sustainability” section of our Investor Relations website at investor.drhorton.com.\nSustainability\nWe publish consistent and relevant sustainability information on an annual basis. Our most recent Sustainability Report published in September 2025 includes data aligned with the homebuilders industry reporting standards prepared by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, now a part of the International Sustainability Standards Board. Our Sustainability Report is not considered part of or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. The report also covers topics of importance to our company and our stakeholders, including, but not limited to: \n•\nRisk management;\n•\nBoard oversight, ethics, diversity and independence;\n•\nHome affordability and community impact;\n•\nHome energy efficiency, quality and safety;\n•\nWorkplace health and safety;\n•\nTalent retention and employee well-being;\n•\nResponsible land development;\n•\nWater management and efficiency; and\n•\nGreenhouse gas emissions.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses. Acquisitions of homebuilding and related businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through purchase contracts. Also, employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions, including existing relationships with municipalities, land owners, developers, subcontractors and suppliers. These inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts. We seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational, financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition is expected to have a positive impact on our earnings, returns and strategic position.\nCompetition\nWe operate as a provider of residential housing in both the for sale and rental markets, which are highly competitive. We compete not only for homebuyers and renters, but also for desirable properties, raw materials, skilled labor and financing. We compete with local, regional and national homebuilding and rental companies and also with existing home sales and rental properties. We compete based on price, location, quality and design of our homes and on mortgage financing terms.\n11\nTable of \nContents\nCompetition to our financial services businesses includes other mortgage lenders and title companies, including national, regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions. Some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do, may operate with different lending criteria and/or may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers. We strive to provide flexible, fairly priced financing alternatives subject to applicable regulations.\nOur businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees, managers and executives. Competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the industries in which we operate and in the general economy.\nGovernmental Regulations and Environmental Matters\nWe operate in industries that are subject to extensive and complex regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal, state and local laws and regulations. These include zoning, density and development requirements and building, environmental, advertising, labor and real estate sales rules and regulations. These regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design, construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets. Our homes are inspected by local authorities where required, and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) are subject to inspection by them. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities. In addition, our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, utilities and other public improvements.\nOur construction and land development activities are also subject to an extensive array of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the environment. The compliance requirements for each site vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with existing environmental regulations applicable to our business. Additionally, our compliance with such regulations has not had, nor is it expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, changes in regulations, such as the climate-related disclosure legislation recently enacted by the State of California, could increase our costs to comply with such regulations, as discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nOur mortgage company must comply with extensive state and federal laws and regulations, which are administered by numerous agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Housing Finance Agency, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA, VA, USDA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. These laws and regulations include many compliance requirements, including licensing, consumer disclosures, fair lending and real estate settlement procedures. As a result, our operations are subject to regular, extensive examinations by the applicable agencies.\nSeasonality\nAlthough significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close more homes in our homebuilding operations and generate greater revenues and pre-tax income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in the working capital requirements for our operations. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.\n12\nTable of \nContents",
  "item7": "ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote an understanding of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This section discusses the results of operations for fiscal 2025 compared to 2024. For similar operating and financial data and discussion of our fiscal 2024 results compared to our fiscal 2023 results, refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on November 19, 2024. \nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” and under Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nResults of Operations — Overview\nFiscal 2025 Operating Results\nIn fiscal 2025, our number of homes closed and our home sales revenues decreased 5% and 7%, respectively, compared to the prior year, and our consolidated revenues decreased 7% to $34.3 billion compared to $36.8 billion. Our pre-tax income was $4.7 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $6.3 billion in fiscal 2024, and our pre-tax operating margin was 13.8% compared to 17.1%. Net income was $3.6 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $4.8 billion in fiscal 2024, and our diluted earnings per share were $11.57 compared to $14.34.\nConsolidated net cash provided by operating activities was $3.4 billion in fiscal 2025 and $2.2 billion in fiscal 2024, and cash provided by our homebuilding operations was $3.4 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, our return on equity (ROE) was 14.6% compared to 19.9% in fiscal 2024, and our return on assets (ROA) was 10.0% compared to 13.9%. ROE is calculated as net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the year divided by average stockholders’ equity, where average stockholders’ equity is the sum of ending stockholders’ equity balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five. ROA is calculated as net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the year divided by average consolidated assets, where average consolidated assets is the sum of total asset balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five.\nDuring fiscal 2025, new home demand continued to be impacted by ongoing affordability constraints and cautious consumer sentiment. As a result, the value of our net sales orders and homebuilding revenues in fiscal 2025 decreased 6% and 7%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2024, and our home sales gross margin decreased to 21.5% as we increased sales incentives, such as buydowns of mortgage rates for our homebuyers. We strive to remain well positioned with affordable product offerings and a flexible lot supply and will continue to manage our home pricing, sales incentives and number of homes in inventory based on the level of demand in each of our local markets. We expect to maintain an elevated level of sales incentives to support demand and may increase them further, depending on market conditions and changes in mortgage interest rates.\nWe remain focused on our relationships with land developers across the country to maximize returns and capital efficiency\n. \nWithin our homebuilding land and lot portfolio, lots controlled through purchase contracts represented 75% of the lots owned and controlled at September 30, 2025 compared to 76% at September 30, 2024. We continue to prioritize the purchase of finished lots from Forestar and other land developers when possible. During fiscal 2025, 65% of the homes we closed were on lots developed by either Forestar or a third party compared to 63% in fiscal 2024.\nWe believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to generate strong cash flows from our operations and manage our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions.\n31\nTable of \nContents\nStrategy\nOur operating strategy focuses on consistently enhancing long-term value to our shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive positions to maximize the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profits and cash flows from operations, while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate changing economic conditions. Our strategy includes the following initiatives:\n•\nDeveloping and retaining highly experienced and productive teams of personnel throughout our company that are aligned and focused on continuous improvement in our operational execution and financial performance.\n•\nMaintaining a significant cash balance and strong overall liquidity position while controlling our level of debt.\n•\nAllocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our geographic risk.\n•\nOffering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market.\n•\nModifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand and maintain affordability.\n•\nDelivering high quality homes and a positive experience to our customers both during and after the sale.\n•\nManaging our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.\n•\nInvesting in lots, land and land development in desirable markets, while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each market relative to the local new home demand.\n•\nControlling a significant portion of our land and finished lot position through purchase contracts and prioritizing the purchase of finished lots from Forestar and other land developers when possible.\n•\nControlling the cost of labor and goods provided by subcontractors and vendors.\n•\nImproving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and other key operational activities.\n•\nControlling our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense infrastructure to match production levels.\n•\nEnsuring that our financial services business provides high quality mortgage and title services to homebuyers efficiently and effectively.\n•\nInvesting in our rental operations to meet rental demand in high growth suburban markets and selling these properties profitably.\n•\nOpportunistically evaluating potential acquisitions to enhance our operating platform.\nWe believe our operating strategy, which has produced positive results in recent years, will allow us to successfully operate through changing economic conditions and maintain our strong financial performance and competitive position. However, we cannot provide any assurance that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and we may need to adjust parts of our strategy to meet future market conditions.\n32\nTable of \nContents\nKey Results\nKey financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2025, as compared to fiscal 2024, were as follows:\nConsolidated Results:\n•\nConsolidated revenues decreased 7% to $34.3 billion compared to $36.8 billion.\n•\nConsolidated pre-tax income decreased 25% to $4.7 billion compared to $6.3 billion.\n•\nConsolidated pre-tax income was 13.8% of consolidated revenues compared to 17.1%.\n•\nIncome tax expense was $1.1 billion compared to $1.5 billion, and our effective tax rate was 23.6% compared to 23.5%.\n•\nNet income attributable to D.R.

The homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into six reporting segments. These reporting segments, which we also refer to as reporting regions, have homebuilding operations located in the following states:\nNorthwest:\nColorado, Oregon, Utah and Washington\nSouthwest:\nArizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada and New Mexico\nSouth Central:\nArkansas, Oklahoma and Texas\nSoutheast:\nAlabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi\nEast:\nGeorgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee\nNorth:\nDelaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin\nThe following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nNet Sales Orders (1)\nYear Ended September 30,\n \nNet Homes Sold\nValue (In millions)\nAverage Selling Price\n \n2025\n2024\n%\nChange\n2025\n2024\n%\nChange\n2025\n2024\n%\nChange\nNorthwest\n4,938\n5,391\n(8)\n%\n$\n2,679.2 \n$\n2,750.8 \n(3)\n%\n$\n542,600 \n$\n510,300 \n6 \n%\nSouthwest\n9,325\n9,942\n(6)\n%\n4,436.4 \n4,855.6 \n(9)\n%\n475,800 \n488,400 \n(3)\n%\nSouth Central\n22,000\n22,549\n(2)\n%\n6,744.9 \n7,285.5 \n(7)\n%\n306,600 \n323,100 \n(5)\n%\nSoutheast\n19,700\n22,982\n(14)\n%\n6,625.8 \n8,115.2 \n(18)\n%\n336,300 \n353,100 \n(5)\n%\nEast\n17,290\n16,425\n5 \n%\n5,958.3 \n5,830.8 \n2 \n%\n344,600 \n355,000 \n(3)\n%\nNorth\n10,170\n9,272\n10 \n%\n4,315.9 \n3,876.1 \n11 \n%\n424,400 \n418,000 \n2 \n%\n83,423\n86,561\n(4)\n%\n$\n30,760.5 \n$\n32,714.0 \n(6)\n%\n$\n368,700 \n$\n377,900 \n(2)\n%\n_______________\n(1)\nNet sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers (gross sales orders), net of cancelled sales orders.\nSales Order Cancellations\nYear Ended September 30,\nCancelled Sales Orders\nValue (In millions)\nCancellation Rate (1)\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNorthwest\n832\n852\n$\n471.5 \n$\n456.2 \n14 \n%\n14 \n%\nSouthwest\n1,702\n1,726\n848.1 \n827.7 \n15 \n%\n15 \n%\nSouth Central\n4,473\n4,805\n1,462.2 \n1,608.6 \n17 \n%\n18 \n%\nSoutheast\n4,699\n5,570\n1,627.3 \n1,997.0 \n19 \n%\n20 \n%\nEast\n3,892\n3,850\n1,378.7 \n1,363.7 \n18 \n%\n19 \n%\nNorth\n2,500\n2,208\n1,045.2 \n912.5 \n20 \n%\n19 \n%\n \n18,098\n19,011\n$\n6,833.0 \n$\n7,165.7 \n18 \n%\n18 \n%\n_______________\n(1)\nCancellation rate represents the number of cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders.\n35\nTable of \nContents\nNet Sales Orders\nThe value of net sales orders was $30.8 billion (83,423 homes) in fiscal 2025 compared to $32.7 billion (86,561 homes) in fiscal 2024. The decrease in value was primarily attributable to a 4% decrease in sales order volume, along with a 2% decrease in the average selling price.\nIn regions where sales order volume decreased, the markets contributing most to the decrease in fiscal 2025 were the Salt Lake City market in the Northwest, the Phoenix and California markets in the Southwest, the Dallas and Fort Worth markets in the South Central and the Florida markets (particularly Tampa and Jacksonville) in the Southeast. In regions where sales order volume increased, the markets contributing most to the increase were the North Carolina markets in the East and the New Jersey, Chicago and suburban Washington, D.C. markets in the North.\nDuring fiscal 2025, new home demand continued to be impacted by ongoing affordability constraints and cautious consumer sentiment. We remain well positioned with affordable product offerings and a flexible lot supply and will continue to manage our home pricing, sales incentives and number of homes in inventory based on the level of new home demand in each of our local markets.\nSales Order Backlog\nAs of September 30,\n \nHomes in Backlog\nValue (In millions)\nAverage Selling Price\n \n2025\n2024\n%\nChange\n2025\n2024\n%\nChange\n2025\n2024\n%\nChange\nNorthwest\n476\n535\n(11)\n%\n$\n277.8 \n$\n284.2 \n(2)\n%\n$\n583,600 \n$\n531,200 \n10 \n%\nSouthwest\n1,035\n1,214\n(15)\n%\n486.4 \n623.6 \n(22)\n%\n470,000 \n513,700 \n(9)\n%\nSouth Central\n2,435\n2,709\n(10)\n%\n753.1 \n872.4 \n(14)\n%\n309,300 \n322,000 \n(4)\n%\nSoutheast\n2,405\n3,095\n(22)\n%\n821.9 \n1,135.5 \n(28)\n%\n341,700 \n366,900 \n(7)\n%\nEast\n2,323\n2,744\n(15)\n%\n839.5 \n1,012.3 \n(17)\n%\n361,400 \n368,900 \n(2)\n%\nNorth\n2,111\n1,883\n12 \n%\n941.4 \n842.3 \n12 \n%\n445,900 \n447,300 \n— \n%\n10,785\n12,180\n(11)\n%\n$\n4,120.1 \n$\n4,770.3 \n(14)\n%\n$\n382,000 \n$\n391,700 \n(2)\n%\nSales Order Backlog\nSales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period.

The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a 5% decrease in closings volume, along with a 2% decrease in the average selling price.\nIn regions where homes closed decreased, the markets contributing most were the Salt Lake City market in the Northwest, the Phoenix and California markets in the Southwest, the Dallas and Fort Worth markets in the South Central and the Florida markets (particularly Tampa and Jacksonville) in the Southeast. In regions where homes closed increased, the markets contributing most to the increase were the North Carolina markets in the East and the suburban Washington, D.C., Chicago and New Jersey markets in the North.\nHomebuilding Operating Margin Analysis\nPercentages of Related Revenues\nYear Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nGross profit — home sales\n21.5 \n%\n23.5 \n%\nGross profit — land/lot sales and other\n40.0 \n%\n31.3 \n%\nInventory and land option charges\n(0.5)\n%\n(0.2)\n%\nGross profit — total homebuilding\n21.1 \n%\n23.3 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n8.3 \n%\n7.5 \n%\nOther (income) expense\n(0.3)\n%\n(0.3)\n%\nHomebuilding pre-tax income\n13.1 \n%\n16.1 \n%\nHome Sales Gross Profit\nGross profit from home sales decreased to $6.8 billion in fiscal 2025 from $8.0 billion in fiscal 2024 and decreased 200 basis points to 21.5% as a percentage of home sales revenues. The percentage decrease resulted from a decrease of 170 basis points due to the average cost of our homes closed increasing along with a decrease in the average selling price of those homes, 20 basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect costs and 10 basis points due to an increase in the amortization of capitalized interest.\nWe remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. To adjust to changes in market conditions during recent years, we have used a higher level of incentives and reduced home prices and sizes of our home offerings where necessary to provide better affordability to homebuyers. We expect our incentive levels to stay elevated during fiscal 2026, the extent to which will depend on market conditions and changes in mortgage interest rates.\nLand/Lot Sales and Other Revenues\nLand/lot sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were $83.5 million and $58.2 million in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. We continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. We generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them. However, some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers. We may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons. As of September 30, 2025, our homebuilding operations had $21.4 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months.\n37\nTable of \nContents\nInventory and Land Option Charges\nAt the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and perform detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. As a result of this review, there were $6.7 million of impairments recorded in our homebuilding segment during the three months ended September 30, 2025. During fiscal 2025, impairment charges related to our homebuilding segment totaled $29.9 million compared to $14.0 million in fiscal 2024.\nAs we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows, we may modify our pricing and incentives, construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment. If the housing market or economic conditions are adversely affected for a prolonged period, we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. These evaluations could result in impairment charges, which could be significant.\nDuring fiscal 2025 and 2024, earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs related to our homebuilding segment’s land purchase contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were $114.3 million and $54.9 million, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense\nSG&A expense from homebuilding activities increased 3% to $2.62 billion in fiscal 2025 from $2.55 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A expense was 8.3% and 7.5% in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, with the increase primarily due to the decrease in homebuilding revenues.\nEmployee compensation and related costs were $2.06 billion and $2.09 billion in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, representing 79% and 82% of SG&A costs in those years. Our homebuilding operations employed 9,972 and 10,071 people at September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe attempt to control our homebuilding SG&A costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations; however, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues.\nInterest Incurred\nWe capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. Interest incurred by our homebuilding operations increased 104% to $103.1 million in fiscal 2025 from $50.5 million in fiscal 2024, primarily due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate of homebuilding debt outstanding as well as a 33% increase in the average amount of that debt. Interest charged to cost of sales was 0.4% of homebuilding cost of sales (excluding inventory and land option charges) in both years.\nOther Income\nOther income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was $101.7 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $107.6 million in fiscal 2024. Other income consists of interest income and various other types of ancillary income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes, land and lots. The activities that result in this ancillary income are not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.\nBusiness Acquisition\nIn October 2025, we acquired the homebuilding operations of SK Builders for approximately $80 million in cash. SK Builders operates in and around Greenville, South Carolina. The assets acquired included approximately 160 homes in inventory, 260 lots and a sales order backlog of 110 homes. We also obtained control of approximately 1,320 additional lots through land purchase contracts.\n38\nTable of \nContents\nHomebuilding Results by Reporting Region\n \nYear Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n \nHomebuilding\nRevenues\nHomebuilding\nPre-tax\nIncome (1)\nPre-tax Income as % of\nRevenues\nHomebuilding\nRevenues\nHomebuilding\nPre-tax\nIncome (1)\nPre-tax Income as % of\nRevenues\n \n(In millions)\nNorthwest\n$\n2,686.2 \n$\n395.7 \n14.7 \n%\n$\n2,761.7 \n$\n420.8 \n15.2 \n%\nSouthwest\n4,595.3 \n517.1 \n11.3 \n%\n4,914.7 \n703.5 \n14.3 \n%\nSouth Central\n6,899.3 \n964.6 \n14.0 \n%\n7,652.1 \n1,331.4 \n17.4 \n%\nSoutheast\n6,971.2 \n839.9 \n12.0 \n%\n8,876.8 \n1,441.4 \n16.2 \n%\nEast\n6,138.0 \n834.0 \n13.6 \n%\n6,073.1 \n1,059.6 \n17.4 \n%\nNorth\n4,225.5 \n583.6 \n13.8 \n%\n3,683.4 \n498.4 \n13.5 \n%\n$\n31,515.5 \n$\n4,134.9 \n13.1 \n%\n$\n33,961.8 \n$\n5,455.1 \n16.1 \n%\n_______________\n(1)\nExpenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our corporate office.

At the time of purchase, the undeveloped land is generally vested with the rights to begin development or construction work, and we plan and coordinate the development of our land into residential lots for use in our homebuilding business. We manage our inventory of owned land and lots and homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.\nOur homebuilding segment’s inventories at September 30, 2025 and 2024 are summarized as follows:\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nConstruction in Progress and \nFinished Homes\nResidential Land/Lots Developed\nand Under Development\nLand Held\nfor Development\nLand Held\nfor Sale\nTotal Inventory\n(In millions)\nNorthwest\n$\n647.4 \n$\n1,225.3 \n$\n16.2 \n$\n2.9 \n$\n1,891.8 \nSouthwest\n1,003.8 \n2,047.1 \n8.7 \n8.9 \n3,068.5 \nSouth Central\n1,643.0 \n2,288.6 \n0.3 \n— \n3,931.9 \nSoutheast\n1,537.8 \n2,502.3 \n12.6 \n9.1 \n4,061.8 \nEast\n1,561.4 \n2,836.3 \n— \n— \n4,397.7 \nNorth\n1,222.8 \n1,414.6 \n— \n0.2 \n2,637.6 \nCorporate and unallocated \n(1)\n127.5 \n198.9 \n0.5 \n0.3 \n327.2 \n \n$\n7,743.7 \n$\n12,513.1 \n$\n38.3 \n$\n21.4 \n$\n20,316.5 \n \nSeptember 30, 2024\nConstruction in Progress and \nFinished Homes\nResidential Land/Lots Developed \nand Under Development\nLand Held\nfor Development\nLand Held\nfor Sale\nTotal Inventory\n(In millions)\nNorthwest\n$\n719.6 \n$\n1,215.6 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n1,935.2 \nSouthwest\n1,378.1 \n1,889.3 \n6.8 \n4.7 \n3,278.9 \nSouth Central\n1,701.5 \n2,024.5 \n0.3 \n1.7 \n3,728.0 \nSoutheast\n2,146.9 \n2,124.3 \n13.1 \n0.2 \n4,284.5 \nEast\n1,626.4 \n2,347.3 \n— \n4.5 \n3,978.2 \nNorth\n1,287.6 \n1,262.2 \n— \n1.4 \n2,551.2 \nCorporate and unallocated \n(1)\n126.0 \n148.5 \n0.3 \n0.2 \n275.0 \n \n$\n8,986.1 \n$\n11,011.7 \n$\n20.5 \n$\n12.7 \n$\n20,031.0 \n_______________\n(1)\nCorporate and unallocated inventory consists primarily of capitalized interest and property taxes.\n41\nTable of \nContents\nOur land and lot position and homes in inventory at September 30, 2025 and 2024 are summarized as follows:\n \nSeptember 30, 2025\nLand/Lots\nOwned \n(1)\nLots Controlled Through\nLand and Lot Purchase\nContracts (2)(3)\nTotal Land/Lots\nOwned and\nControlled\nHomes in\nInventory \n(4)\nNorthwest\n12,200\n17,100\n29,300\n1,700\nSouthwest\n19,600\n31,200\n50,800\n3,200\nSouth Central\n35,900\n111,900\n147,800\n7,700\nSoutheast\n31,500\n113,600\n145,100\n6,300\nEast\n31,500\n111,100\n142,600\n6,300\nNorth\n16,300\n60,000\n76,300\n4,400\n \n147,000\n444,900\n591,900\n29,600\n \n25 \n%\n75 \n%\n100 \n%\n \n \nSeptember 30, 2024\nLand/Lots\nOwned \n(1)\nLots Controlled Through\nLand and Lot Purchase\nContracts (2)(3)\nTotal Land/Lots\nOwned and\nControlled\nHomes in\nInventory \n(4)\nNorthwest\n13,000\n18,600\n31,600\n2,100\nSouthwest\n22,200\n29,200\n51,400\n4,200\nSouth Central\n39,000\n109,600\n148,600\n9,000\nSoutheast\n29,500\n134,300\n163,800\n9,700\nEast\n32,500\n129,300\n161,800\n7,500\nNorth\n16,300\n59,400\n75,700\n4,900\n \n152,500\n480,400\n632,900\n37,400\n \n24 \n%\n76 \n%\n100 \n%\n \n_______________\n(1)\nLand/lots owned included approximately 78,400 and 64,400 owned lots that are fully developed and ready for home construction at September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n(2)\nThe total remaining purchase price of lots controlled through land and lot purchase contracts at September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $26.0 billion and $25.2 billion, respectively, secured by earnest money deposits of $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.

The single-family rental operations construct and lease single-family homes within a community and market each community for a bulk sale of rental homes. The multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and sell residential rental properties, with a primary focus on constructing garden style apartment communities in high growth suburban markets. Single-family and multi-family rental property sales are recognized as revenues, and rental income is recognized as other income.

In fiscal 2025, the volume of first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers decreased 2%, primarily due to the 5% decrease in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations, partially offset by an increase in the percentage of homes closed for which DHI Mortgage handled our homebuyers’ financing. The percentage of homes closed for which DHI Mortgage handled our homebuyers’ financing was 81% in fiscal 2025, up from 78% in fiscal 2024. This increase reflects DHI Mortgage’s ongoing efforts to align their business with our homebuilding operations by offering competitive products and pricing.\nThe number of loans sold decreased 3% in fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year. Substantially all mortgage loans held for sale on September 30, 2025 were eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. During fiscal 2025, approximately 71% of our mortgage loans were sold directly to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or into securities backed by Ginnie Mae, and 27% were sold to one other major financial entity. Changes in market conditions could result in a greater concentration of our mortgage sales in future periods to fewer financial entities and directly to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, and we may need to make other adjustments to our mortgage operations.\nFinancial Services Revenues and Expenses\nTotal loan origination volume decreased 2% during fiscal 2025, and revenues from our mortgage operations decreased 4% to $655.3 million from $681.6 million in fiscal 2024. Revenues from our title operations decreased 7% to $185.9 million in fiscal 2025 from $200.9 million in fiscal 2024, due to a decrease in transactions closed through our title operations.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expense related to our financial services operations decreased 3% to $651.4 million in fiscal 2025 from $672.4 million in the prior year. As a percentage of financial services revenues, G&A expense was 77.4% in fiscal 2025 compared to 76.2% in the prior year. Fluctuations in financial services G&A expense as a percentage of revenues can occur because some components of revenue fluctuate differently than loan volumes, and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned. Our financial services operations employed 2,967 and 3,149 people at September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOther income, net of other expense, included in our financial services operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary. Other income decreased 12% to $88.9 million in fiscal 2025 from $101.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in interest income on our loan origination volume.\n48\nTable of \nContents\nResults of Operations — Other Businesses\nIn addition to our homebuilding, rental, Forestar and financial services operations, we engage in other business activities through our subsidiaries. We conduct insurance-related operations, own water rights and other water-related assets and own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements. The pre-tax income of all of our subsidiaries engaged in other business activities was $35.9 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $73.4 million in fiscal 2024. The pre-tax income in fiscal 2024 includes other income of $27.9 million related to a sale of mineral rights.\nResults of Operations — Consolidated\nIncome before Income Taxes\nPre-tax income was $4.7 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $6.3 billion in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, our homebuilding, rental, financial services and Forestar businesses generated pre-tax income of $4.1 billion, $170.0 million, $278.7 million and $219.3 million, respectively, compared to $5.5 billion, $228.7 million, $311.2 million and $270.1 million, respectively, in fiscal 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense was $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, and our effective tax rate was 23.6% and 23.5% in those years. The effective tax rates for both years include an expense for state income taxes and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and federal energy efficient home tax credits.\nOur deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, were $59.1 million at September 30, 2025 compared to $182.4 million at September 30, 2024. We have a valuation allowance of $14.6 million and $14.9 million at September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, related to deferred tax assets for state net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards that are expected to expire before being realized. We will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state NOL and tax credit carryforwards. Any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law (the new law). The new law terminates the energy efficient home tax credit for homes closing after June 30, 2026 and enacts certain other tax provisions that will impact our financial statements. The termination of the energy efficient home tax credit will result in a reduced tax benefit beginning in fiscal 2026. Our tax benefits related to the energy efficient home tax credit were $39.5 million and $70.4 million in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. None of the other tax provisions enacted by the new law have a significant impact on our financial statements.\n49\nTable of \nContents\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nWe have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. Our current levels of cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions.\nWe continue to invest in our homebuilding and rental inventories to expand our operations and consolidate market share. We are also returning capital to shareholders through repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments. We are maintaining significant homebuilding cash balances and liquidity to support the scale and level of activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and opportunities.\nAt September 30, 2025, we had outstanding notes payable with varying maturities totaling an aggregate principal amount of $6.0 billion. $1.6 billion was payable within 12 months, which includes $1.4 billion outstanding under our mortgage repurchase facilities. Future interest payments associated with our notes payable total $1.3 billion, of which $287.4 million is payable within 12 months.\nAt September 30, 2025, our ratio of debt to total capital (notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus notes payable) was 19.8% compared to 18.9% at September 30, 2024. Our net debt to total capital (notes payable net of cash divided by stockholders’ equity plus notes payable net of cash) was 11.0% at September 30, 2025 compared to 5.2% at September 30, 2024. Over the long term, we intend to maintain our ratio of debt to total capital around 20%.\nAt September 30, 2025, we had outstanding letters of credit of $282.3 million and surety bonds of $3.5 billion, issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third-party guarantees.\nWe regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock and maintain sufficient cash and liquidity levels to support our other operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. D.R. Horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in July 2024, registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined. Forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in September 2024, registering $750 million of equity securities, of which $300 million is reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering (ATM) program that was entered into in November 2024. As market conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. We believe that our existing cash resources, revolving credit facilities, mortgage repurchase facilities and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs and debt obligations for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter.\nCapital Resources - Homebuilding\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n — At September 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalents of our homebuilding segment totaled $2.2 billion.\nBank Credit Facility\n — We have a senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility that was amended in December 2024 to increase its capacity from $2.19 billion to $2.23 billion. The facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows for an increase in its size to $3.0 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. In June 2025, we utilized this accordion feature, increasing the facility’s size to $2.305 billion through an additional commitment. Of the total commitments, $2.04 billion mature on December 18, 2029, and $265 million mature on October 28, 2027. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100% of the total revolving credit commitments. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. At September 30, 2025, there were no borrowings outstanding and $231.2 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $2.07 billion.\n50\nTable of \nContents\nOur homebuilding revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities, including requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. The credit agreement governing the facility imposes restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens.\nPublic Unsecured Debt \n— At September 30, 2025, we had $3.0 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes outstanding that mature from October 2026 through October 2035. The indenture governing our senior notes imposes restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens.\nIssuances \n— In February 2025, we issued $700 million principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due October 15, 2035. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and financing costs is 5.6%. In May 2025, we issued $500 million principal amount of 4.85% senior notes due October 15, 2030. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and financing costs is 5.1%. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually.\nRedemptions \n— In October 2024, we repaid $500 million principal amount of our 2.5% senior notes at maturity. In September 2025, we redeemed $500 million principal amount of our 2.6% senior notes due October 15, 2025 for $505.9 million, which included $5.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest.\nCompliance and Guarantors \n— At September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of our homebuilding revolving credit facility and public debt obligations. Our homebuilding revolving credit facility and homebuilding senior notes are guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc.’s significant wholly owned homebuilding subsidiaries.\nDebt and Stock Repurchase Authorizations\n — In July 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of our debt securities. In April 2025, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of our common stock, replacing the previous authorization. During fiscal 2025, we repurchased 30.7 million shares at a total cost, including commissions and excise taxes, of $4.3 billion, of which $2.6 billion was repurchased under the previous authorization. At September 30, 2025, the full amount of the debt repurchase authorization was remaining, and $3.3 billion of the stock repurchase authorization was remaining. The debt and stock repurchase authorizations have no expiration date.\nCapital Resources - Rental\nDuring the past few years, we have made significant investments in our rental operations. The inventory in our rental segment totaled $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion at September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n — At September 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalents of our rental segment totaled $140.8 million.\nBank Credit Facility\n — Our rental subsidiary, DRH Rental, has a $1.05 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $2.0 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. Availability under the rental revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on the book value of DRH Rental’s real estate assets and unrestricted cash. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the total revolving credit commitments. The maturity date of the facility is October 10, 2027. At September 30, 2025, there were $600 million of borrowings outstanding at a 6.2% annual interest rate and no letters of credit issued under the facility, resulting in available capacity of $450 million.\n51\nTable of \nContents\nThe rental revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. The financial covenants require DRH Rental to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. At September 30, 2025, DRH Rental was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility.\nThe rental revolving credit facility is guaranteed by DRH Rental’s wholly owned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries and have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries. The rental revolving credit facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, Forestar or financial services operations.\nCapital Resources - Forestar\nForestar’s achievement of its long-term growth objectives will depend on its ability to obtain financing and generate sufficient cash flows from operations. As market conditions permit, Forestar may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to provide capital for future growth and additional liquidity. At September 30, 2025, Forestar’s ratio of debt to total capital (notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus notes payable) was 31.2% compared to 30.7% at September 30, 2024. Forestar’s ratio of net debt to total capital (notes payable net of cash divided by stockholders’ equity plus notes payable net of cash) was 19.3% compared to 12.4% at September 30, 2024.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n — At September 30, 2025, Forestar had cash and cash equivalents of $379.2 million. \nBank Credit Facility\n — As of September 30, 2025, Forestar had a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was amended in December 2024 to increase its capacity from $410 million to $640 million and to raise the uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $1.0 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The amendment also extended the maturity date of the facility. Of the total commitments, $575 million mature on December 18, 2029, and $65 million mature on October 28, 2026. In October 2025, Forestar utilized the accordion feature and increased the size of its revolving credit facility to $665 million through an additional $25 million commitment that matures on December 18, 2029. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the total revolving credit commitments. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base calculation based on the book value of Forestar’s real estate assets and unrestricted cash. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. At September 30, 2025, there were no borrowings outstanding and $51.1 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $588.9 million.\nThe Forestar revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. The financial covenants require Forestar to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity.\nUnsecured Debt\n — As of September 30, 2025, Forestar had $800 million principal amount of senior notes issued pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that mature from March 2028 through March 2033 and represent unsecured obligations of Forestar. In March 2025, Forestar issued $500 million principal amount of 6.5% senior notes due March 15, 2033, with interest payable semi-annually. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of financing costs is 6.7%. The net proceeds from this issuance were primarily used to fund Forestar’s tender offer to purchase any and all of its outstanding $400 million principal amount of 3.85% senior notes due 2026 (of which $329.4 million aggregate principal amount was tendered). The repurchase price of $333.4 million included accrued and unpaid interest of $4.2 million. In September 2025, Forestar redeemed the remaining $70.6 million principal amount of its 3.85% senior notes for $71.6 million, which included $1.0 million of accrued and unpaid interest. In fiscal 2025, Forestar recognized a $1.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase and redemption of the notes.\n52\nTable of \nContents\nCompliance and Guarantors \n— At September 30, 2025, Forestar was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility and senior note obligations. Forestar’s revolving credit facility and its senior notes are guaranteed by Forestar’s wholly owned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries and have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries. They are not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, rental or financial services operations.\nDebt Repurchase Authorization\n — In April 2020, Forestar’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30 million of Forestar’s debt securities. All of the $30 million authorization was remaining at September 30, 2025, and the authorization has no expiration date.\nIssuance of Common Stock\n — During fiscal 2025, there were no shares issued under Forestar’s ATM program. At September 30, 2025, $750 million remained available for issuance under Forestar’s shelf registration statement, with $300 million reserved for sales under the ATM program.\nCapital Resources - Financial Services\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n — At September 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalents of our financial services segment totaled $244.5 million.\nMortgage Repurchase Facilities\n — Our mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has two mortgage repurchase facilities, one of which is committed and the other of which is uncommitted, that provide financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to counterparties upon receipt of funds from the counterparties. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facilities.\nIn May 2025, the committed mortgage repurchase facility was amended to reduce its capacity to $1.4 billion and extend its maturity date to May 6, 2026. The capacity of the facility can be increased to $2.0 billion subject to the availability of additional commitments. At September 30, 2025, DHI Mortgage had an obligation of $1.1 billion under the committed mortgage repurchase facility at a 5.8% annual interest rate.\nAt September 30, 2025, the uncommitted mortgage repurchase facility had a borrowing capacity of $500 million, of which DHI Mortgage had an obligation of $304.8 million at a 5.4% annual interest rate.\nAt September 30, 2025, $2.23 billion of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $2.19 billion were pledged under the committed mortgage repurchase facility, and $332.6 million of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $312.9 million were pledged under the uncommitted mortgage repurchase facility.\nThe facilities contain financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable indebtedness to tangible net worth ratio and its minimum required liquidity. At September 30, 2025, DHI Mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facilities.\nThe mortgage repurchase facilities are not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, rental or Forestar operations.\nIn the past, DHI Mortgage has been able to renew or extend its committed mortgage repurchase facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the facility during periods of higher-than-normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the committed mortgage repurchase facility, utilize the uncommitted mortgage repurchase facility or obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.\n53\nTable of \nContents\nOperating Cash Flow Activities\nIn fiscal 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was $3.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2024. Cash provided by operating activities in the current year primarily consisted of $3.4 billion, $173.2 million and $105.5 million of cash provided by our homebuilding, financial services and rental segments, partially offset by $197.7 million of cash used in our Forestar segment. The most significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both years was net income.\nCash provided by a decrease in construction in progress and finished home inventory was $1.2 billion in fiscal 2025 compared to $141.3 million in fiscal 2024, due to a decrease in our homes in inventory. Cash used to increase residential land and lots was $1.9 billion and $2.6 billion in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nInvesting Cash Flow Activities\nIn fiscal 2025, net cash used in investing activities was $168.7 million compared to $190.6 million in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, uses of cash included purchases of property and equipment totaling $137.4 million and the payment of $53.1 million related to a business acquisition in our South Central region. In fiscal 2024, uses of cash included purchases of property and equipment totaling $165.3 million.\nFinancing Cash Flow Activities\nWe expect the short-term financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Long-term financing needs for our operations may be funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities or equity securities through the capital markets.\nIn fiscal 2025, net cash used in financing activities was $4.8 billion, consisting primarily of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $4.3 billion, repayment of $1.0 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes, Forestar’s repayment of $400 million principal amount of senior notes, payment of cash dividends totaling $494.8 million and net payments on our rental revolving credit facility and mortgage repurchase facilities of $145 million and $125.5 million, respectively. These uses of cash were partially offset by note proceeds from our issuances of $700 million principal amount of 5.5% homebuilding senior notes and $500 million principal amount of 4.85% homebuilding senior notes and Forestar’s issuance of $500 million principal amount of 6.5% senior notes.\nIn fiscal 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion, consisting primarily of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $1.8 billion, payment of cash dividends totaling $395.2 million and net payments on our mortgage repurchase facilities of $135.8 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by note proceeds from our issuance of $700 million principal amount of 5.0% homebuilding senior notes and net borrowings on our rental revolving credit facility of $345 million.\nOur Board of Directors approved and we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.40 per share in fiscal 2025 and $0.30 per share in fiscal 2024. In October 2025, our Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share, payable on November 20, 2025 to stockholders of record on November 13, 2025. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and general business conditions.\nSeasonality\nAlthough significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and pre-tax income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in the working capital requirements for our homebuilding, rental, lot development and financial services operations. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.\n54\nTable of \nContents\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nAs of September 30, 2025, D.R. Horton, Inc. had $3.0 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes outstanding due through October 2035 and no amounts outstanding on its homebuilding revolving credit facility.\nAll of the homebuilding senior notes and the homebuilding revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain subsidiaries of D.R. Horton, Inc. (Guarantors or Guarantor Subsidiaries). Each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by D.R. Horton, Inc. Our subsidiaries associated with the single-family and multi-family rental operations, Forestar lot development operations, financial services operations and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the homebuilding senior notes or the homebuilding revolving credit facility (collectively, Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries). The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such Guarantor. The guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The guarantees will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Guarantors.\nThe guarantees by a Guarantor Subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) the sale or other disposition of its common stock whereby it is no longer a subsidiary of ours; (2) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets (other than to us or another Guarantor); (3) its merger or consolidation with an entity other than us or another Guarantor; or (4) its ceasing to guarantee any of our publicly traded debt securities and ceasing to guarantee any of our obligations under our homebuilding revolving credit facility.\nThe enforceability of the obligations of the Guarantor Subsidiaries under their guarantees may be subject to review under applicable federal or state laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference and similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. In certain circumstances, a court could void the guarantees, subordinate amounts owing under the guarantees or order other relief detrimental to the holders of our guaranteed obligations. The indenture governing our homebuilding senior notes contains a “savings clause,” which limits the liability of each Guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such Guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, it may reduce such Guarantor’s obligation such that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would not suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information for D.R. Horton, Inc. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among D.R. Horton, Inc. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries, as well as their investment in, and equity in earnings from the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.\nD.R.

Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, and for the years ended September 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023. Each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\n — We generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. Our performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. Proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWhen we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.\nRevenues associated with our mortgage operations primarily include net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and servicing rights. We typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations whereby mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and loan values are adjusted through revenues for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold. Expected gains and losses from the sale of loans, adjusted for (i) estimated costs to complete and originate the loan and (ii) the estimated percentage of written loan commitments that will result in a closed mortgage loan, are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through revenues at the time of commitment. We sell substantially all of the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. Interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.\nMortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions, which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses. Based on historical experience, analysis of the volume of mortgages we originated, discussions with our mortgage purchasers and current housing and credit market conditions, we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale, as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests.\nInventories and Cost of Sales\n — Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and construction. Costs that we incur after projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance and cleaning, are charged to SG&A expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense as incurred.\nLand and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. Home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community. Cost of sales for lots sold includes all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot in the community. Any changes to the estimated total development costs after the initial home or lot closings in a community are generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes or lots in the community associated with the relevant development activity. \n57\nTable of \nContents\nWhen a home is closed, we generally have not paid all of the incurred costs necessary to complete the home. We record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed. We compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. We monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals, such differences have not been significant.\nAt the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment. We generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level, and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development, residential land and lots developed and under development, land held for sale, rental properties and construction in progress and finished homes, based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale. A particular community often includes inventory in more than one category. In certain situations, inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans. In reviewing each of our communities, we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following:\n•\ngross margins on homes closed in recent months;\n•\nprojected gross margins on homes sold but not closed;\n•\nprojected gross margins based on community budgets;\n•\nprojected gross margins of rental property sales;\n•\ntrends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales;\n•\nsales absorption rates; and\n•\nperformance of other communities in nearby locations.\nIf indicators of impairment are present for a community, we perform an impairment evaluation of the community, which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. If so, impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local market conditions:\n•\nsupply and availability of new and existing homes;\n•\nlocation and desirability of our communities;\n•\nvariety of product types offered in the area;\n•\npricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors;\n•\nalternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third parties;\n•\namount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market or sub-market; and\n•\nlocal economic and demographic trends.\nFor those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot. Impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities and completed rental properties when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes.\n58\nTable of \nContents\nWe rarely purchase land for resale. However, when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans, and we determine that we will sell the asset, the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met. We record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. In performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, recent offers received to purchase the property, prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land. If the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nThe key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions, and are inherently uncertain. Although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates, due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates.\nLegal Claims and Insurance\n — We are named as a defendant in various claims, complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. At any point in time, we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters, personal injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and other matters. We have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes. Approximately 98% and 97% of these reserves related to construction defect matters at September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOur reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. At September 30, 2025 and 2024, we had reserves for approximately 875 and 825 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During fiscal 2025, we were notified of approximately 455 new construction defect claims and resolved 405 construction defect claims for a total cost of $57.2 million. We have closed a significant number of homes during recent years, and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes. Although regulations vary from state to state, construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate. Historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims. These estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs.\nHistorical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent, and we believe they may continue to fluctuate. We also believe that fluctuations in housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. If the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations, it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims, which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future. If the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates, they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity.\nWe estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. However, because the self-insured retentions under these policies are significant, we anticipate we will largely be self-insured. Additionally, we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies.\nThe estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built, claim frequency, claim settlement costs and patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. Due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies, actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts. A 10% increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately $198.4 million in our reserves and a $43.3 million increase in our insurance receivable, resulting in additional expense of $155.1 million. A 10% decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately $178.0 million in our reserves and a $40.5 million decrease in our insurance receivable, resulting in a reduction in expense of $137.5 million. For additional information regarding our legal claims reserves, see Note L, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\n59\nTable of \nContents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation and modifies other income tax related disclosures. The standard is effective for our annual periods beginning in fiscal 2026. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures,” which requires disclosure of certain costs and expenses on an interim and annual basis in the notes to the financial statements. The standard is effective for our annual periods beginning in fiscal 2028 and interim periods beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2029, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our disclosures.\n60\nTable of \nContents",
