MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to enhance the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Certain amounts in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not sum due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOur principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a large pharmaceutical company with the speed, agility and focus on innovation typically found in the biotech industry. Our focus as a biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to make a meaningful difference: oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular, neuroscience and other areas where we can also create long-term value. Our priorities are to focus on transformational medicines where we have a competitive advantage, drive operational excellence and strategically allocate capital for long-term growth and shareholder returns. We are driving commercial execution in our key first-in-class and/or best-in-class marketed products, where we continue to expand and see potential for further expansion into the future. For further information on our strategy, see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Summary—Strategy\" in our 2024 Form 10-K. Refer to the Summary of Abbreviated Terms at the end of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for terms used throughout the document.\nIn 2025, we have achieved multiple regulatory approvals across our portfolio, including the: (i) approval of \nBreyanzi\n for adults with relapsed or refractory FL in the EU, (ii) approval of \nCamzyos\n for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive HCM in Japan, (iii) approval of \nOpdivo\n + \nYervoy\n as a first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or advanced HCC in both the U.S. and the EU, (iv) approval of \nOpdivo\n + \nYervoy\n for first-line treatment of adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR colorectal cancer in the U.S. and Japan, (v) approval of \nOpdivo\n as a perioperative regimen for resectable high risk NSCLC in the EU and (vi) approval of \nOpdivo Qvantig\n for use across multiple adult solid tumors in the EU. Additionally, we received label updates from the FDA that have reduced or removed certain patient monitoring requirements associated with the use of \nCamzyos\n, \nBreyanzi\n and \nAbecma\n.\nWe continue to pursue activities to advance and expand our pipeline through our internal research and development efforts as well as through business development activities. In October 2025, BMS entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Orbital Therapeutics, which will provide the Company with full rights to OTX-201, a preclinical \nin vivo\n CAR T-cell therapy currently in IND-enabling studies for autoimmune disease. Additionally in 2025 the Company (i) entered into a strategic collaboration with BioNTech to co-develop and co-commercialize BioNTech's investigational bispecific antibody pumitamig (BNT327/BMS986545) across multiple solid tumor types, (ii) acquired a global exclusive license from Philochem for OncoACP3, a radiopharmaceutical therapeutic and diagnostic agent targeting prostate cancer, and (iii) expanded our development and manufacturing capabilities by opening a new radiopharmaceutical facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, which will support RPTs acquired in connection with the RayzeBio acquisition. For additional information relating to our acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and other arrangements refer to \"Item 1. Financial Statements — Note 3. Alliances\" and \"Item 1. Financial Statements — Note 4. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements\".\nWe remain committed to the strategic allocation of resources and investing in areas that maximize value and drive sustainable growth. As previously announced, our ongoing strategic productivity initiative includes acceleration of the delivery of medicines to patients by evolving and streamlining our enterprise operating model in key areas such as R&D, manufacturing, commercial and other functions. As a result of an expansion in 2025, we expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately $2.0 billion by the end of 2027. The exit costs resulting from these actions are included in our updated 2023 Restructuring Plan.\n31\nFinancial Highlights\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nDollars in millions, except per share data\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nTotal Revenues\n$\n12,222 \n$\n11,892 \n$\n35,692 \n$\n35,958 \nDiluted earnings/(loss) per share\nGAAP\n$\n1.08 \n$\n0.60 \n$\n2.93 \n$\n(4.45)\nNon-GAAP\n1.63 \n1.80 \n4.89 \n(0.53)\nRevenues increased 3% for the third quarter of 2025 and decreased 1% on a year-to-date basis. Demand increased across the Growth Portfolio and for \nEliquis\n, which was offset by the impact of generics across the remainder of the Legacy Portfolio\n. \nAdditionally, year-to-date revenues were impacted by the redesign of the U.S. Medicare Part D program.\nThe $0.48 increase in GAAP EPS for the third quarter of 2025 was primarily due to the impact of certain specified items, including lower amortization of acquired intangible assets, and cost savings from our ongoing strategic productivity initiative in 2025, partially offset by higher one-time Acquired IPRD charges. After adjusting for specified items, the $0.17 decrease in non-GAAP EPS was primarily due to higher one-time Acquired IPRD charges, partially offset by costs savings from our ongoing strategic productivity initiative in 2025.\nThe $7.38 increase in GAAP EPS year-to-date was primarily due to lower one-time Acquired IPRD charges, the impact of certain specified items, including lower amortization of acquired intangible assets, and cost savings from our ongoing strategic productivity initiative in 2025. After adjusting for specified items, the $5.42 increase in non-GAAP EPS was primarily due to lower one-time Acquired IPRD charges and cost savings from our ongoing strategic productivity initiative in 2025.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude specified items that represent certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other items impacting the comparability of financial results. For further information and reconciliations relating to our non-GAAP financial measures refer to \"—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nEconomic and Market Factors\nGovernmental Actions\nAs regulators continue to focus on prescription drugs, our products are facing increased pressures across the portfolio. These pressures stem from legislative and policy changes, including price controls, pharmaceutical market access, discounting, changes to tax and importation laws and other restrictions in the U.S., EU and other regions around the world. These pressures have resulted in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and smaller populations for whom payers will reimburse, which can negatively impact our results of operations (including intangible asset impairment charges), operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. In August 2024, as part of the first round of government price setting pursuant to the IRA, the HHS announced the \"maximum fair price\" for a 30-day equivalent supply of \nEliquis\n, which applies to the U.S. Medicare channel effective January 1, 2026. In January 2025, the HHS selected \nPomalyst\n as a medicine subject to \"negotiation\" for government-set prices beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products could be selected in future years based upon the selection criteria currently utilized by the HHS or potentially expanded future criteria. This could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiry of intellectual property protections. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our results of operations, and it is possible that these changes may result in a material impact on our business and results of operations. \nIn May 2025, President Trump issued an executive order entitled, \"Delivering Most-Favored Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to American Patients,\" which, among various proposals, directs the HHS to facilitate direct-to-consumer purchasing programs for pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell their products to American patients at the most-favored-nation price and to communicate most-favored-nation price targets to manufacturers and propose a rulemaking plan to impose most-favored-nation pricing if “significant progress” is not made towards achieving such pricing. On July 31, 2025, the Trump administration sent letters to several pharmaceutical manufacturers, including BMS, which outlined steps that such manufacturers should take to advance certain objectives of the executive order. While there is significant uncertainty around the potential implementation of this executive order and related rule-making, it could result in reduced prices and reimbursement for certain of our U.S. products and may significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\n32\nIn July 2025, the OBBBA was enacted which, among other things, aims to achieve efficiencies in U.S. federal government healthcare spending over the next decade, primarily within Medicaid. Additionally, this legislation makes permanent many provisions of the TCJA and modifies certain rules, including within the international tax framework, thereby offering increased certainty for future business planning. The OBBBA also permits businesses to immediately deduct up to 100% of their qualifying domestic R&D expenses in the year they are incurred for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024, and allows businesses to accelerate deductions (over a one- or two-year period) of domestic R&D expenses that were deferred from 2022 to 2024. We are continuing to assess the full scope of this legislation and its potential commercial implications, and it is possible that these changes may impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nAt the state level, multiple states have passed, are pursuing or are considering government action via legislation or regulations to change drug pricing and reimbursement (e.g., establishing prescription drug affordability boards, implementing manufacturer mandates tied to the Federal Public Health Service Act drug pricing program, etc.). Some of these state-level actions may also influence federal and other state policies and legislation. Given the current uncertainty surrounding the adoption, timing and implementation of many of these measures, as well as pending litigation challenging such laws, we are unable to predict their full impact on our business. However, such measures could modify or decrease access, coverage, or reimbursement of our products, or result in significant changes to our sales or pricing practices, which could have a material impact on our revenues and results of operations. With respect to the Federal Public Health Service Act drug pricing program, certain states have enacted laws regulating manufacturer pricing obligations under the program to date. Several additional states are considering similar potential legislation or other government actions, and we expect other states may do the same in the future.\nThe United States and other countries have recently imposed, and may continue to impose, new tariffs. While pharmaceuticals are largely exempt from the recently imposed U.S. tariffs, such exemptions may be terminated or may not apply to any future tariffs. Additionally, pharmaceuticals are not exempt from certain tariffs recently imposed outside of the United States. We continue to evaluate the impacts of tariffs on our business and results of operations, and it is possible that these changes, or any future changes, may result in a material impact on our business and results of operations.\nSee risk factors on these items included under “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Product, Industry and Operational Risks—Increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the U.S. and abroad continue to negatively affect our revenues and profit margins”, “—We could lose market exclusivity of a product earlier than expected”, “—We could experience difficulties, delays and disruptions in our supply chain as well as in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products” and “—Changes to tax regulations could negatively impact our earnings” in our 2024 Form 10-K.\n33\nSignificant Product and Pipeline Approvals\nThe following is a summary of the significant approvals received in 2025 as of October 30, 2025:\nProduct\nDate\nApproval\nOpdivo + Yervoy\nAugust 2025\nJapan’s Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare approval of \nOpdivo\n + \nYervoy\n for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent microsatellite instability-high (MSI-High) colorectal cancer. \nOpdivo + Yervoy\nJune 2025\nJapan’s Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare approval of \nOpdivo\n + \nYervoy\n for the treatment of unresectable HCC.\nInrebic\nJune 2025\nJapan’s Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare approval of \nInrebic\n for the treatment of myelofibrosis.\nOpdivo Qvantig\nMay 2025\nEC approval of \nOpdivo Qvantig\n for use across multiple adult solid tumors as monotherapy, monotherapy maintenance following completion of intravenous \nOpdivo\n plus \nYervoy\n combination therapy, or in combination with chemotherapy or cabozantinib.\nOpdivo\nMay 2025\nEC approval for perioperative regimen of neoadjuvant \nOpdivo\n and chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant \nOpdivo\n for the treatment of resectable NSCLC at high-risk of recurrence in adult patients whose tumors have PD-L1 expression ≥1%. \nOpdivo + Yervoy\nApril 2025\nFDA approval of \nOpdivo\n + \nYervoy\n as a first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC.\nOpdivo + Yervoy\nApril 2025\nFDA approval of \nOpdivo\n + \nYervoy\n as a first-line treatment of adult and pediatric patients (12 years and older) with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient CRC.\nCamzyos\nMarch 2025\nJapan’s Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare approval of \nCamzyos\n for the treatment of oHCM. \nBreyanzi\nMarch 2025\nEC approval of \nBreyanzi\n for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL after two or more lines of systemic therapy. \nOpdivo + Yervoy\nMarch 2025\nEC approval of \nOpdivo\n + \nYervoy\n for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or advanced HCC.\nAugtyro\nFebruary 2025\nEC approval for \nAugtyro\n as a treatment for adult patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC and for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with NTRK-positive solid tumors.\nRefer to \"—Product and Pipeline Developments\" for a listing of other developments in our marketed products and late-stage pipeline since the start of the third quarter of 2025.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements\nRefer to \"Item 1.

Average U.S. net selling prices decreased 5% year-to-date compared to the corresponding period a year ago.\nInternational\n•\nInternational revenues increased 6% during the third quarter of 2025 and 4% year-to-date, primarily due to higher demand across the Growth Portfolio and for \nEliquis\n, partially offset by generic erosion within the remainder of the Legacy Portfolio. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, international revenues increased 3% during the third quarter of 2025 and year-to-date.\nNo single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of total revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.

We disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to certain limited exceptions. There were none as of September 30, 2025, for our U.S. distribution channels, and as of June 30, 2025, for our non-U.S. distribution channels.\nIn the U.S., we generally determine our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which accounted for approximately 85% of total gross sales of U.S. products during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic erosion, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes.\nCamzyos\n is only available through a restricted program called the \nCamzyos\n REMS Program. Product distribution is limited to REMS certified pharmacies, and enrolled pharmacies must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive \nCamzyos\n. \nRevlimid\n \nand \nPomalyst\n are distributed in the U.S. primarily through contracted pharmacies under the Lenalidomide REMS (\nRevlimid\n) and \nPomalyst\n REMS programs, respectively. These are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of \nRevlimid\n \nand \nPomalyst\n.\n \nInternationally, \nRevlimid\n \nand \nImnovid\n are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities' specifications to provide for the products' safe and appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.\nOur non-U.S. businesses have significantly more direct customers. Information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. We limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. When this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. business during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 is not available prior to the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand for the current quarter, subject to certain limited exceptions, in our next annual report on Form 10-K.\n43\nExpenses\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nDollars in millions\n2025\n2024\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n% Change\nCost of products sold\n(a)\n$\n3,435 \n$\n2,957 \n16 \n%\n$\n9,839 \n$\n9,156 \n7 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n1,789 \n1,983 \n(10)\n%\n5,086 \n6,278 \n(19)\n%\nResearch and development\n2,528 \n2,374 \n6 \n%\n7,365 \n7,968 \n(8)\n%\nAcquired IPRD\n633 \n262 \n142 \n%\n2,328 \n13,343 \n(83)\n%\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n831 \n2,406 \n(65)\n%\n2,491 \n7,179 \n(65)\n%\nOther (income)/expense, net\n(108)\n234 \n(146)\n%\n725 \n588 \n23 \n%\nTotal Expenses\n$\n9,108 \n$\n10,216 \n(11)\n%\n$\n27,834 \n$\n44,512 \n(37)\n%\n(a)    Excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold increased by $478 million in the third quarter of 2025 and $683 million year-to-date, primarily due to higher alliance profit sharing and product mix.

The estimated tax impacts from the OBBBA are reflected in the Company's income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. For additional information on the impacts of the OBBBA, refer to \"Item 1. Financial Statements — Note 7. Income Taxes\".\nThe change in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily driven by changes in jurisdictional earnings mix and income tax reserves. During the third quarter of 2025, additional reserves of $160 million were recorded for certain transfer pricing matters. Further, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects a $12.1 billion one-time, non-tax deductible charge for the acquisition of Karuna as well as the release of income tax reserves related to the resolution of the Celgene 2017-2019 IRS audit.\nExcluding the impact of specified items, the change in effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily driven by jurisdictional earnings mix. On a year-to-date basis, the change in the effective tax rate was further impacted by the Karuna acquisition in 2024.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. These items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results. These items are excluded from non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information because the Company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods, including (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, (ii) unwinding of inventory purchase price adjustments, (iii) acquisition and integration expenses, (iv) restructuring costs, (v) accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, (vi) divestiture gains or losses, (vii) stock compensation resulting from acquisition-related equity awards, (viii) pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, (ix) equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments (including fair value adjustments attributed to limited partnerships and other investments), and (x) amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from Celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates, as well as certain other significant tax items. We also provide international revenues for our priority products excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We calculate foreign exchange impacts by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior period average currency rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in Exhibit 99.1 to our Form 8-K filed on October 30, 2025 and are incorporated herein by reference.\nNon-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and investors’ overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n46\nSpecified items were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nDollars in millions\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nInventory purchase price accounting adjustments\n$\n13 \n$\n13 \n$\n38 \n$\n34 \nIntangible asset impairment \n— \n— \n— \n280 \nSite exit and other costs\n110 \n88 \n114 \n105 \nCost of products sold\n122 \n101 \n152 \n419 \nAcquisition related charges\n(a)\n— \n— \n19 \n372 \nSite exit and other costs\n1 \n7 \n6 \n19 \nSelling, general and administrative\n1 \n7 \n25 \n391 \nIPRD impairments\n85 \n— \n385 \n590 \nAcquisition related charges\n(a)\n— \n— \n— \n348 \nSite exit and other costs\n10 \n21 \n49 \n36 \nResearch and development\n95 \n21 \n434 \n974 \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n831 \n2,406 \n2,491 \n7,179 \nInterest expense\n(b)\n(12)\n(12)\n(36)\n(37)\nProvision for restructuring\n75 \n78 \n432 \n558 \nIntegration expenses\n36 \n69 \n110 \n214 \nLitigation and other settlements\n179 \n— \n425 \n61 \nAcquisition expenses\n— \n— \n5 \n50 \nIntangible asset impairment \n— \n47 \n— \n47 \nEquity investment (gains)/losses\n(190)\n(13)\n(92)\n(222)\nContingent consideration\n— \n— \n336 \n— \nOther \n10 \n106 \n10 \n116 \nOther (income)/expense, net\n98 \n275 \n1,189 \n787 \nIncrease to earnings/(loss) before income taxes\n1,148 \n2,810 \n4,291 \n9,750 \nIncome taxes on items above\n(190)\n(371)\n(447)\n(1,296)\nSpecified tax charge/(benefit)\n(c)\n160 \n— \n160 \n(502)\nIncome taxes\n(31)\n(371)\n(287)\n(1,798)\nIncrease to net earnings/(loss) attributable to BMS\n$\n1,117 \n$\n2,439 \n$\n4,004 \n$\n7,952 \n(a) Includes cash settlement of unvested stock awards, and other related costs incurred in connection with the recent acquisitions.\n(b) Includes amortization of purchase price adjustments to Celgene debt.\n(c) Includes additional reserves for certain transfer pricing matters in 2025 and the release of tax reserves related to the resolution of the Celgene 2017-2019 IRS audit in 2024.\n47\nThe reconciliations from GAAP to Non-GAAP were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nDollars in millions, except per share data\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet earnings/(loss) attributable to BMS \nGAAP\n$\n2,201 \n$\n1,211 \n$\n5,967 \n$\n(9,020)\nSpecified items\n1,117 \n2,439 \n4,004 \n7,952 \nNon-GAAP\n$\n3,318 \n$\n3,650 \n$\n9,971 \n$\n(1,068)\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding – diluted\n2,039 \n2,031 \n2,039 \n2,026 \nDiluted earnings/(loss) per share attributable to BMS\nGAAP\n$\n1.08 \n$\n0.60 \n$\n2.93 \n$\n(4.45)\nSpecified items\n0.55 \n1.20 \n1.96 \n3.92 \nNon-GAAP\n$\n1.63 \n$\n1.80 \n$\n4.89 \n$\n(0.53)\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur net debt position was as follows:\nDollars in Millions\nSeptember 30,\n2025\nDecember 31,\n2024\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n15,726 \n$\n10,346 \nMarketable debt securities – current\n776 \n513 \nMarketable debt securities – non-current\n406 \n320 \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities\n16,909 \n11,179 \nShort-term debt obligations\n(4,509)\n(2,046)\nLong-term debt\n(44,469)\n(47,603)\nNet debt position\n$\n(32,069)\n$\n(38,470)\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, together with our ability to generate cash from operations and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to satisfy our existing and anticipated cash needs, including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital, income taxes, restructuring initiatives, business development, business combinations, asset acquisitions, repurchase of common stock, debt maturities, as well as any debt repurchases through redemptions or tender offers. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our net debt position decreased by $6.4 billion primarily driven by cash provided by operations of $12.2 billion, partially offset by dividend payments of $3.8 billion and payments for recent acquisitions, collaborations and milestones of $2.2 billion.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, $229 million 3.875% Notes and €575 million 1.000% Euro Notes matured and were repaid.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, BMS issued an aggregate principal amount of $13.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (\"2024 Senior Unsecured Notes\"), with proceeds, net of discount and loan issuance costs, of $12.9 billion. The Company used the net proceeds from this offering to partially fund the acquisitions of RayzeBio and Karuna and used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. Additionally, $2.5 billion 2.900% Notes and $395 million 3.625% Notes matured and were repaid.\nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue a maximum of $5.0 billion of unsecured notes that have maturities of not more than 365 days from the date of issuance. \nAs of September 30, 2025, we had a five-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in January 2030, which is extendable annually by one year with the consent of the lenders. Additionally, in February 2024, we entered into a $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility, which expired in January 2025. The facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants and may be used to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings. No borrowings were outstanding under any revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nDividend payments were $3.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The decision to authorize dividends is made on a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors.\n48\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, income tax payments were $2.2 billion and $3.1 billion, including $991 million and $799 million, respectively, for the transition tax following the TCJA enactment.\nCash Flows\nThe following is a discussion of cash flow activities:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nDollars in millions\n2025\n2024\nCash flow provided by/(used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n12,182 \n$\n10,751 \nInvesting activities\n(2,674)\n(21,156)\nFinancing activities\n(4,319)\n6,769 \nOperating Activities\nThe $1.4 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities compared to 2024 was primarily driven by lower expenses due to the ongoing strategic productivity initiative, lower tax payments, and lower acquisition-related expenses, including the cash settlement of unvested stock awards in 2024, partially offset by higher GTN payments.\nInvesting Activities\nThe $18.5 billion change in cash used in investing activities compared to 2024 was due to higher acquisition-related payments of $19.5 billion in 2024, partially offset by lower net proceeds from marketable debt securities of $1.0 billion.\nFinancing Activities\nThe $11.1 billion change in cash provided by/(used in) financing activities compared to 2024 was primarily due to net debt borrowings of $10.5 billion in 2024 to fund our acquisitions.\n49\nProduct and Pipeline Developments\nOur R&D programs are managed on a portfolio basis from early discovery through late-stage development and include a balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. Our late-stage R&D programs in Phase III development include both investigational compounds for initial indications and additional indications or formulations for marketed products. The following are the developments in our marketed products and our late-stage pipeline since the start of the third quarter of 2025 as of October 30, 2025:\nProduct\nIndication\nDate\nDevelopments\nBreyanzi\nMZL\nAugust 2025\nAnnounced that the FDA accepted the sBLA for \nBreyanzi\n as a potential treatment for adults with relapsed or refractory MZL who have received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. The FDA has assigned a PDUFA goal date of December 5, 2025. The application is based on the results from the Phase II TRANSCEND FL study.\nCamzyos\noHCM\nAugust 2025\nPresented results from COLLIGO-HCM, a global retrospective real-world data study, at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2025. The analysis showed that \nCamzyos\n (mavacamten) was associated with reductions in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and improvements in symptom burden in a racially diverse population of patients with symptomatic oHCM treated in an international, real-world setting. The effectiveness and safety demonstrated in COLLIGO-HCM are consistent with results from randomized, controlled clinical trials and further support the growing body of evidence for \nCamzyos\n, the first and only approved cardiac myosin inhibitor, as a standard of care for New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III symptomatic oHCM.\niberdomide\nRRMM\nSeptember 2025\nAnnounced that the Phase III EXCALIBER-RRMM study evaluating iberdomide combined with standard therapies in patients with RRMM demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rates, compared with the control arm, in a planned interim analysis of the MRD endpoint. The safety profile of iberdomide in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone in this study is generally consistent with previous studies.\nizalontamab brengitecan\nNSCLC\nAugust 2025\nAnnounced, with SystImmune, that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to izalontamab brengitecan (iza-bren) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with mutated epidermal growth factor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations whose disease has progressed on or after treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and platinum-based chemotherapy. The FDA's decision was based on the efficacy and safety data from three ongoing clinical trials: BL-B01D1-101, BL-B01D1-203 and BL-B01D1-LUNG-101.\nOpdivo + Yervoy\nCRC\nAugust 2025\nAnnounced that Japan’s Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare approved \nOpdivo\n + \nYervoy\n for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent microsatellite instability-high (MSI-High) colorectal cancer. This approval is based on the results from the Phase III CheckMate-8HW study.\nReblozyl\nMyelofibrosis-Associated Anemia\nJuly 2025\nAnnounced that the Phase III INDEPENDENCE trial evaluating \nReblozyl\n with concomitant janus kinase inhibitor therapy in adult patients with myelofibrosis-associated anemia receiving red blood cell (RBC) transfusion did not meet its primary endpoint of RBC transfusion independence.\nSotyktu\nPsA\nOctober 2025\nAnnounced that the Phase III POETYK PsA-1 trial further confirmed the efficacy and safety of \nSotyktu\n in adults with active PsA who were not previously treated with a biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. The trial demonstrated that \nSotyktu\n improved and maintained meaningful clinical responses, inhibition of radiographic progression and patient-reported outcomes through Week 52 in adults with active PsA.\nJuly 2025\nThe FDA accepted for review the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for \nSotyktu\n for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis. The FDA assigned PDUFA goal date of March 6, 2026.\nIn addition, China's Center for Drug Evaluation of National Medical Products Administration and Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare accepted sNDAs for \nSotyktu\n in the same indication. The EMA has also validated the Type II variation application to expand the indication for \nSotyktu\n to include this disease. The regulatory applications are based on the pivotal Phase III POETYK PsA-1 and POETYK PsA-2 trials.\n50\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our critical accounting policies are those that significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates. For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to \"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our 2024 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. For information regarding the impact of recently adopted accounting standards, refer to \"Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Recently Issued Accounting Standards.\"\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as “should,” “could,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “target,” “may,” “project,” “guidance,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will” and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and projections about our future financial results, goals, plans and objectives and involve inherent risks, assumptions and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years, and could cause our future financial results, goals, plans and objectives to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the statements. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and objectives regarding our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products, our business development strategy and in relation to our ability to realize the projected benefits of our acquisitions, alliances and other business development activities, the impact of any pandemic or epidemic on our operations and the development and commercialization of our products, potential laws and regulations to lower drug prices, including the potential for international reference pricing and most-favored nation drug pricing for our products, government actions relating to the imposition of new tariffs, market actions taken by private and government payers to manage drug utilization and contain costs, the expiration of patents or data protection on certain products, including assumptions about our ability to retain marketing exclusivity of certain products, and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our 2024 Form 10-K, particularly under the section \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" and our other filings with the SEC, include additional information on the factors that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement.\nAlthough we believe that we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. Additional risks that we may currently deem immaterial or that are not presently known to us could also cause the forward-looking events discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q not to occur. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q."
