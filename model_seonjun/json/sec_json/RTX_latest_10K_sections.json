Collins also continues to invest in operational capacity in strategic locations, including in the United States, India, Mexico, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.\nPratt & Whitney \nis among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines for commercial, military, business jet, and general aviation customers. Pratt & Whitney’s Commercial Engines and Military Engines businesses design, develop, produce, and maintain families of large engines for wide- and narrow-body and large regional aircraft for commercial customers and for fighter, bomber, tanker, and transport aircraft for military customers. Pratt & Whitney’s small engine business, Pratt & Whitney Canada, is among the world’s leading suppliers of engines powering regional airlines, general and business aviation, and helicopters. Pratt & Whitney also produces, sells, and services military and commercial auxiliary power units. Pratt & Whitney provides fleet management services and aftermarket maintenance, repair, and overhaul services in all of these segments. \nPratt & Whitney sells products and services principally to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies, and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt & Whitney’s largest commercial customer by sales is Airbus, with sales, prior to discounts and incentives, of 31%, 48%, and 33% of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nPratt & Whitney produces and services the PW1000G Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine family. GTF engine models have demonstrated a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels and lower environmental emissions compared to prior-generation engines. The GTF aftermarket network expanded to 18 facilities worldwide, increasing PW1100G-JM shop visit output by approximately 30% year over year in 2024.\nThe GTF family now powers more than 2,200 aircraft for 85 operators across three aircraft platforms: Airbus A320neo family, Airbus A220, and Embraer E-Jets E2. In 2024, Pratt & Whitney received FAA certification for the GTF engine that will power the Airbus A321XLR aircraft. The GTF Advantage configuration currently under certification testing is expected to extend the benefits of the current GTF engine, increasing takeoff thrust by 4 to 8 percent and reducing fuel consumption by up to an additional 1 percent, maintaining the engine’s lead as the most efficient powerplant for the A320neo family. In 2024, RTX announced it had completed the preliminary design review of the hybrid-electric GTF engine demonstrator for the Clean Aviation SWITCH project.\nPratt & Whitney produces and sustains the F135 engine for the U.S. government’s F-35 Joint Program Office to exclusively power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft (commonly known as the Joint Strike Fighter) produced by Lockheed Martin. F135 propulsion system configurations are used for the U.S. Air Force’s F-35A, the U.S. Marine Corps’ F-35B, and the U.S. Navy’s F-35C jets. F135 engines are also used on all F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and other countries through foreign military sales arrangements. 2024 marked the 50th anniversary since the F-16 Fighting Falcon’s first flight, which was powered by the Pratt & Whitney F100 engine. With more than 300 million flight hours, the F100 is a mainstay powerplant for 23 global air forces, powering approximately two-thirds of global F-16s and nearly three-quarters of F-15s.\nPratt & Whitney completed the F135 Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) preliminary design review and was awarded a new contract valued at up to $1.3 billion for continued work on the ECU. The F135 program also added Greece and Romania as new customers, bringing the total number of global participants to 20. In addition, significant activity continued on military engine development programs including the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion Program (NGAP). The NGAP team completed a critical assessment of its offering with the U.S. Air Force, moving the program closer to completing its detailed design review. Meanwhile, the B-21 Raider, which is powered by Pratt & Whitney engines, continued to progress its flight test program.\n2024 also marked the certification of Pratt & Whitney Canada’s PW545D engine that will power the Cessna Citation Ascend business aircraft from Textron. Pratt & Whitney Canada continues to progress testing of the propulsion system for the RTX Hybrid Electric Flight Demonstrator program, which targets a 30% fuel efficiency improvement and CO2 emissions reduction compared to existing advanced regional turboprops. In connection with the RTX Hybrid Electric Flight demonstrator program, Pratt & Whitney Canada announced the development of an advanced mobile charging unit (MCU) capable of charging high-power batteries at up to 1500 volts. Also in 2024, Airbus Helicopters selected Pratt & Whitney Canada and its PW210 helicopter engine to support the development of a hybrid-propulsion system for its PioneerLab technology demonstrator. \nThe development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities for Pratt & Whitney. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements in which revenues, costs, and risks are shared with third parties. At December 31, 2024, the interests of third-party collaboration participants in Pratt & Whitney-directed jet engine programs ranged, in the aggregate per program, from 13% to 49%. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of our accounting for collaboration arrangements. Pratt & Whitney also continues to enhance its programs through performance improvement measures and product base expansion, utilizing similar collaboration arrangements.\n5\nTable of Contents\nRaytheon\n is a leading provider of defensive and offensive threat detection, tracking and mitigation capabilities for U.S. and foreign government and commercial customers.

Raytheon has experienced increased global demand for the combat-proven Coyote system, a low-cost, expendable, unmanned aircraft system with the capability of operating in autonomous swarms.\nSales and Customers\nWe have substantial U.S. government sales, which we conduct through all three of our business segments. In addition, as a global company, all three of our business segments have substantial international sales. See “Note 20: Segment Financial Data” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nU.S. Government Sales. \nOur U.S. government sales were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSales to the U.S. government \n(1)\n$\n32,246\n \n$\n31,628 \n$\n30,317 \nSales to the U.S. government as a percentage of total net sales \n(1) (2)\n40\n \n%\n46 \n%\n45 \n%\n(1)    Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government.\n(2)    2023 total net sales includes the reduction in sales from the Powder Metal Matter.\nInternational Sales. \nOur sales to international customers, based on customer end use location, where known, were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal international sales\n$\n34,651\n \n$\n29,440 \n$\n25,884 \nTotal international sales as a percentage of total net sales \n(1)\n43\n \n%\n43 \n%\n39 \n%\n(1)    2023 total net sales includes the reduction in sales from the Powder Metal Matter.\n6\nTable of Contents\nBacklog. \nBacklog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts).\nTotal backlog was $218 billion and $196 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the total RPO as of December 31, 2024, we expect approximately 25% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.\nCompetition\nAll of our businesses are subject to significant competition. Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, delivery schedule, past performance, reliability, customer service, innovation, and technology. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. Further, some non-U.S. competitors receive government research and development assistance, marketing subsidies, and other assistance for their products beyond the assistance that may be available to us as a U.S. company.\nOur aerospace businesses compete with numerous U.S. and foreign businesses that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture products and spare parts. Customer selections of aircraft engines, components, and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services. In addition, customers (including the U.S. government and other governments) may purchase parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer, which affects spare parts sales. Some competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products.\nOur defense businesses compete with numerous U.S. and foreign companies in most defense and government electronics, space, effectors, communications, command and control, technical services and support, and other segments. We frequently partner on defense programs with our major suppliers, some of whom are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. In addition, the competitive landscape in the defense industry continues to evolve with trends such as the continued increase in commercial competitors, new entrants with different technology approaches and business models, governmental bid evaluation processes requesting expanded intellectual property disclosures and rights sharing that may risk the loss of competitively sensitive information, and increased government, particularly foreign government, sponsorship of competitors on defense development programs. Moreover, our potential international contract awards, particularly for sales of defense products and services, may be limited by our ability to agree to offset obligations or industrial cooperation obligations, sometimes in the form of in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, designed to enhance local industry.\nPeople\nAs a global technology and innovation-driven company, we depend on a highly skilled workforce. Attracting, developing, advancing, and retaining the best talent is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our business. Individuals with technical, engineering, and science backgrounds, experience, or interests are particularly important for us to succeed in the industries in which we compete. In addition, our defense business in particular requires qualified personnel with security clearances due to our classified programs. Macroeconomic, industry, and labor market conditions continue to affect the environment for hiring and retaining employees with relevant qualifications and experience. While competition for talent has softened, we continue to experience challenges hiring highly qualified personnel for some of our most critical roles and in specific locations. We continuously monitor labor market conditions and trends to mitigate hiring and retention issues.\nGovernance. \nThe Human Capital & Compensation Committee of the RTX Board of Directors oversees the Company’s human capital management. \nWorkforce Demographics. \nAs of December 31, 2024, our global employee population consisted of a total of approximately 186,000 employees, including approximately 57,000 engineering professionals and approximately 34,000 employees represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies. Our employees were located in 52 countries, with 68% of our employees located in the U.S. We have published our U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity EEO-1 report data as part of our Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) Report.\nWe strive to build high-performing teams. We believe a work environment where all individuals are seen, respected, valued, and protected enables them to focus on developing the most innovative solutions to our industry’s greatest challenges. Approximately 19% of our workforce across 31 of the countries in which we operate are members of one or more of our nine global employee resource groups (ERGs). We also support science, technology, engineering, and mathematics initiatives to inspire the workforce of the next generation and build talent pipelines.\nTalent Acquisition, Development, and Retention; Employee Health and Safety.\n We continuously monitor the hiring, retention, and management of our employees by business and function with a focus to attract, develop, engage, advance, and \n7\nTable of Contents\nretain the best talent in the industry. We aim to identify and hire quality external talent with skills matched to our Company’s business needs. We invest in our workforce through internal and external education, training and development programs, and tuition assistance benefits. We also provide market competitive compensation and benefits. We recognize and reward performance during our annual review process. We regularly conduct talent reviews and develop succession plans to ensure that we continue to cultivate the leadership pipeline of talent needed to execute our business strategy. We solicit employee feedback on RTX’s performance as an employer via confidential surveys in the pre-hire, active, and exit stages of employment, and use those results to improve our workplace and employee experience. These surveys cover various topics related to employee engagement and culture. \nWe have industry-leading health and safety programs to help maintain a safe work environment for all employees and mitigate workplace incidents, risks, and hazards. We review and monitor our performance and encourage employee input to identify opportunities to reduce incidents. Moreover, we have industry-leading ethics and compliance programs to help mitigate associated employee risks. We also provide health and wellness benefits and support flexible work arrangements for our employees.\nAdditional information regarding our human capital strategy is available in our “People” section of our ESG Report that can be found on our company website. Information on our website, including our ESG Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. \nFor information on the risks related to our human capital resources, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\nResearch and Development and Operations\nOur innovative products and services incorporate advanced technologies. As a result, we invest substantial amounts in research and development activities using our own funds and under contractual arrangements with our customers, to enhance existing products and services and develop future technologies to meet our customers’ changing needs and requirements, as well as to address new business opportunities. \nWe manufacture and service our products in approximately 230 manufacturing, production, or overhaul facilities in approximately 30 countries, including the U.S.\nIntellectual Property\nWe maintain a robust portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, and franchises related to our businesses. We rely on a combination of these rights, along with nondisclosure agreements, information technology (IT) security systems, internal controls and compliance systems, and other measures to protect our intellectual property. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses to certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed or used in the performance of government contracts. Commercial customers also have licenses to certain of our intellectual property largely in connection with the sale of our products. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.\nSuppliers and Raw Materials\nWe are dependent on a global supply chain for a wide range of raw materials, commodities, components, and services. Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. In addition, in some cases, we must comply with specific procurement requirements, which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. We are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium, nickel, and titanium, and we rely on foreign suppliers as single-source suppliers of some components. \nIn recent years, we have experienced supply chain disruptions that have impacted our ability to procure raw materials, microelectronics, and certain commodities, resulting in delays and increased costs. These disruptions have been driven by supply chain market constraints and macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and labor market shortages. The high inflationary environment has increased material and component prices, labor rates and supplier costs, which has negatively impacted our costs. Current geopolitical conditions, including conflicts and other causes of strained intercountry relations, as well as sanctions and other trade restrictive activities, are continuing to contribute to these supply chain issues.\nWe have implemented certain actions and programs which have mitigated some of the impacts, but we anticipate that supply chain disruptions will continue. We work with our suppliers and subcontractors to assess and address the causes of performance failures and delays, including by providing suppliers with raw materials and technical support. We have arranged second and third supply source alternatives in some cases and have increased our materials and parts inventory. We regularly pursue cost \n8\nTable of Contents\nreductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating or re-sourcing our purchases, expanding the use of long-term agreements, reducing the number of suppliers generally (except as described above for important supply alternatives), strategic sourcing in cost competitive regions, capitalizing on competitions among suppliers and other low-cost sourcing initiatives, and extending our contractually negotiated raw material pricing to higher-tier suppliers in our supply chain. For additional information related to supply chain issues, see Item IA. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\nOther Matters Relating to Our Business\nAs worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic, industry, and other factors, including those described in this section, in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results and Risk Factor Summary,” and in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\nRegulatory Matters\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the DoD and the FAA. Similar government authorities exist in all of the countries in which we do business.\nU.S. Government Contracts. \nAs previously discussed, the U.S. government is our largest customer, representing a substantial majority of our total defense sales. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, termination costs, and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source, and any other damages it suffers. Our U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures, and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government; department-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS); and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit, and product integrity requirements. A contractor’s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, cash withholds on contract payments, forfeiture of profits, and/or the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines, and could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. In addition, in order to support U.S. government priorities, we may begin performance on an undefinitized contract action prior to completing contract negotiations on the terms, specifications, or price between the parties. The U.S. government has the ability to unilaterally definitize contracts, which would obligate us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. government, affecting our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization may negatively affect our profitability.\nFor further discussion of risks related to government contracting, including on-going litigation associated with U.S. government audits and investigations, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” of this Form 10-K and “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCommercial Aerospace Product Regulation. \nOur commercial aerospace products are subject to regulations by the FAA, foreign aviation administration authorities, and international regulatory bodies, including on production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures, and continuing operational safety. In addition, commercial aerospace regulations and regulator approaches differ across jurisdictions and changes in such regulations and implementing legislation can impact our operations.\nGlobal Trade Regulation.\n We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export and import of products, services, and technology from and into the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include, among others, the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) provisions administered by the U.S. Department of State (DOS), embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and import regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Certain of our products, services, and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the U.S. Munitions List of the ITAR, the Commerce Control List of the EAR, or are otherwise subject to the EAR and/or the U.S. Munitions Import List, and we are required to obtain licenses and authorizations from the appropriate U.S. government agencies before exporting these products out of the U.S. or importing these products into the U.S. Foreign policy of the U.S. or other licensing jurisdictions may affect the licensing process or otherwise prevent us from engaging in business dealings with \n9\nTable of Contents\ncertain individuals, entities, or countries. Any failure by us, our customers, or our suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to engage in export or import transactions, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government.\nFor further discussion of risks related to exports and imports, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors”.\nCompliance Matters. \nAs previously disclosed, on October 15, 2024, Raytheon Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) (DPA-1) with the DOJ and on October 16, 2024, the Company became subject to an administrative order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), since 2012 in connection with certain Middle East contracts. On October 16, 2024, Raytheon Company also entered into a DPA (DPA-2) and a False Claims Act (FCA) settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017. Under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required, among other things, to retain an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged) and are required to undertake certain cooperation and disclosure obligations (for a term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company’s and the Company’s compliance with their respective obligations under DPA-1, DPA-2, and the SEC’s Administrative Order. DPA-1 and DPA-2 further provide that, in the event the DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the period of deferral of prosecution that Raytheon Company or the Company have violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation, including the charges against Raytheon Company in the relevant DPA. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the agreement with the SEC, the SEC may vacate the Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. In the event of any such determination of breach, the Company may face additional adverse impacts.\nAlso as previously disclosed, on August 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement (CA) with the DOS to resolve alleged civil violations of the AECA and the ITAR. The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company to implement remedial compliance measures and to conduct an external audit of the Company’s ITAR compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external independent Special Compliance Officer (SCO). The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. If the Company is unable to satisfy the requirements of the CA within three years as determined by the DOS, it may face a continuation of the CA, additional fines, or other adverse impacts.\nFor further discussion of DPA-1, DPA-2, the SEC Administrative Order, and the CA, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” and “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental Regulation.\n Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations, including with respect to chemical substances in our products, manufacturing processes, and the operation of our facilities, as well as the generation, treatment, storage, disposal, and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in some of our operations and have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, costs associated with environmental compliance activities and management of remediation matters at sites with pollutants. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services under our contracts with the U.S. government. In addition, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund law, or state law counterparts to the Superfund law, for a number of sites. The nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility. We also manage various government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the U.S. government, and we have relied upon U.S. government funding to pay such costs. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions or requirements relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Environmental matters are further addressed in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” and “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nMost of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected. \n10\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we could be affected by future foreign or domestic laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, and we monitor developments in environmental and climate-related laws and regulations and their potential impact to our business and financial condition. Changes in environmental and climate-related laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, energy taxes, product efficiency standards, global chemical regulations, and mandatory disclosure obligations could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and facility upgrades and could increase our operational and environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes.\nFor further discussion of risks related to environmental and climate matters and other government regulations, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\nOther Applicable Regulations.\n \nWe conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. As a result, our businesses and operations are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to export and import controls, tariffs, taxes, investment, sanctions, exchange controls, anti-corruption, privacy, and cash repatriation. Our international sales are also subject to varying currency, political, and economic risks.\nCautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results and Risk Factor Summary\nThis Form 10-K contains statements which, to the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact, constitute “forward-looking statements” under the securities laws.

  "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to provide information to the reader in understanding our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements between select periods, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. In addition, we discuss certain accounting principles, policies, and critical estimates that affect our financial statements. Our discussion also contains some additional context regarding our business, including industry considerations and the business environment, as well as certain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nW\ne are a global premier systems provider of high technology products and services to the aerospace and defense industries. We operate in three principal business segments: Collins Aerospace (Collins), Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” and “RTX” mean RTX Corporation and its subsidiaries. References to “Raytheon Company” mean Raytheon Company, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of RTX on April 3, 2020 through an all-stock merger transaction between United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon Company (the surviving company of which is RTX Corporation).\nIndustry Considerations\nOur worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic, and political factors on both a regional and global level. Our operations include original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and extensive related aftermarket parts and services related to our aerospace operations. Our defense business serves both domestic and international customers primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers. Our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycles in our commercial aerospace spares contracts and certain service contracts in our defense business, and longer cycles in our aerospace OEM and aftermarket maintenance contracts and on our defense contracts to design, develop, manufacture, or modify complex equipment. Our customers are in the public and private sectors, and our businesses reflect an extensive geographic diversification that has evolved with continued globalization. \nGovernment legislation, policies, and regulations can impact our business and operations. Changes in environmental and climate change-related laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, and energy taxes, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and facility upgrades and could increase our operational and environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes. In addition, government and industry-driven safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions, government imposed travel restrictions, and government procurement practices can impact our businesses. \nCollins and Pratt & Whitney serve both commercial and government aerospace customers. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs), available seat miles, and the general economic health of airline carriers and airframers, as well as the financial strength and performance of airframers, are key barometers for our commercial aerospace operations. Performance in the general aviation sector is closely tied to the overall health of the economy and is positively correlated to corporate profits. Many of our aerospace customers are covered under long-term aftermarket service agreements at both Collins and Pratt & Whitney, which are inclusive of both spare parts and services.\nOur defense operations are affected by U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budget and spending levels, changes in demand, changes in policy positions or priorities, the domestic and global political and economic environment, and the evolving nature of the global and national security threat environment. In addition, our defense businesses engage in both direct commercial sales, which generally require U.S. government licenses and approvals, as well as foreign military sales, which are government-to-government transactions initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. Changes in these budget and spending levels, policies, or priorities, which are subject to U.S. domestic and foreign geopolitical risks and threats, may impact our defense businesses, including the timing of and delays in U.S. government licenses and approvals for sales, the risk of sanctions, or other restrictions.\nOther Matters\nGlobal, economic, and political conditions, changes in raw material and commodity prices and supply, labor availability and costs, inflation, interest rates, potential changes in U.S. government policy positions, including changes in DoD policies or priorities, geopolitical conflicts and strained intercountry relations, U.S. and non-U.S. tax law changes, foreign currency exchange rates, sanctions, tariffs, energy costs and supply, levels of air travel, the financial condition of commercial airlines, and the impact from natural disasters and weather conditions create uncertainties that could impact our businesses. \n36\nTable of Contents\nLegal Matters.\n As previously announced, in 2024 the Company resolved several outstanding legal matters, herein referred to as “Resolution of Certain Legal Matters.” The Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) (DPA-1) with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Company settled an administrative proceeding with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), in connection with certain Middle East contracts since 2012 (Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters). The Company also entered into a DPA and a False Claims Act (FCA) settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017 (DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes). Under these DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain, among other things, an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged) and are required to undertake certain cooperation and disclosure obligations (for a term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company’s and the Company’s compliance with their respective obligations under the DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order. The DPAs further provide that, in the event the DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the period of deferral of prosecution that Raytheon Company or the Company have violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation, including the charges against Raytheon Company in the relevant DPA. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the SEC Administrative Order, the SEC may vacate the SEC Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. In the event of any such determination or breach, the Company may face additional adverse impacts. In addition, the Company resolved certain voluntarily disclosed export controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser extent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a Consent Agreement (CA) with the Department of State (DOS) (Trade Compliance Matters). The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company to implement remedial compliance measures and to conduct an external audit of the Company’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external, independent Special Compliance Officer (SCO). The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. As a result of the DPAs, SEC Administrative Order, FCA settlement agreement and CA, we recorded a combined pre-tax charge of $918 million during the second quarter of 2024, which included $269 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes (in addition to amounts previously accrued), $364 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters (in addition to amounts previously accrued), and $285 million related to Trade Compliance Matters. In the fourth quarter we made payments of $580 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Dispute and $384 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters. See “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nPratt & Whitney Powder Metal Matter.\n \nIn 2023, Pratt & Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100G-JM (PW1100) Geared Turbofan (GTF) fleet, which powers the A320neo family of aircraft (A320neo) (herein referred to as the “Powder Metal Matter”). See “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nGlobal Supply Chain. \nWe are dependent on a global supply chain and have experienced supply chain disruptions that resulted in delays and increased costs and adversely affected our performance. These disruptions impacted our ability to procure raw materials, microelectronics, and certain commodities on a timely basis and/or at expected prices, and are driven by supply chain market constraints and macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and labor market shortages. Current geopolitical conditions, including conflicts and other causes of strained intercountry relations, as well as sanctions and other trade restrictive activities, are contributing to these issues. Furthermore, our suppliers and subcontractors have been impacted by these same issues. We have implemented actions and programs to mitigate some of the impacts but anticipate supply chain disruptions to continue.\nEconomic Environment.\n The inflationary environment has increased material and component prices, labor rates, and supplier costs and has negatively impacted our performance, including our productivity expectations. Due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses, and their respective customer and supplier contracts, we are not always able to offset cost increases by increasing our contract value or pricing, in particular on our fixed-price contracts. Increasing material, component, and labor prices could subject us to losses in our fixed price contracts in the event of cost overruns. In addition, higher interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and tightened the availability of capital. Among other things, these effects can constrain our customers’ purchasing power and decrease orders for our products and services and impact the ability of our customers to make payments and our suppliers to perform. Moreover, volatility in interest rates and financial markets can lead to economic uncertainty, an economic downturn or recession, and impact the demand for our products and services as well as our supply chain. We continue to pursue strategic and operational initiatives to help address these macroeconomic pressures, including our digital transformation, operational modernization, cost reduction, and advanced \n37\nTable of Contents\ntechnology programs, and we apply our Customer Oriented Results and Excellence (CORE) operating platform to the execution of these initiatives. However, the impact of these pressures and corresponding initiatives is uncertain and subject to a range of factors and future developments.\nU.S. Government’s Budget. \nSince the end of its fiscal year 2024, the U.S. government has been operating under two continuing resolutions, the most recent of which was signed on December 21, 2024, to keep the government funded through March 14, 2025 while Congress works to enact full year fiscal year 2025 (FY25) appropriation bills. Under a continuing resolution, federal agencies continue to operate generally at the same funding levels as the prior year, but typically new spending initiatives cannot be executed during this period. It is currently uncertain whether Congress will be able to enact FY25 appropriations bills and, if such bills are passed, the spending levels and priorities for defense and other areas. If Congress is unable to complete the FY25 appropriation bills (or pass another continuing resolution) by March 14, 2025, then the U.S. government would shut down, during which time federal agencies would cease all non-essential functions. In the event of a U.S. government shutdown, our business, program performance and results of operations could be impacted by the resulting disruptions to federal government offices, workers, and operations, including risks relating to the funding of certain programs, stop work orders, delays in contract awards, new program starts, payments for work performed, and other actions. We also may experience similar impacts in the event of an extended period of continuing resolutions. Generally, the significance of these impacts will primarily be based on the length of the shutdown or continuing resolution. Furthermore, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which imposes limits on discretionary spending for defense and non-defense programs in exchange for the lifting of the debt ceiling in June 2023, if Congress fails to enact appropriation bills by April 30, 2025, budget caps will be reduced and corresponding automatic reductions to agency budget accounts will be enforced through sequestration.\nGeopolitical Matters. \nIn response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company’s management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software, and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers; however, based on information available to date, we do not currently expect these issues will have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We will continue to monitor future developments, including additional sanctions and other measures, that could adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers.\nIn February 2023, China announced sanctions against Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD) (a former RTX business segment which became part of the Raytheon business during the third quarter of 2023), and previously announced it may take measures against RTX, in connection with certain foreign military sales to Taiwan. The Chinese sanctions against RMD included a fine equal to twice the value of the arms that RMD sold to Taiwan since September 2020. Since that time, China has announced additional sanctions against the Raytheon business and a Collins joint venture. If China were to impose additional sanctions, enforce announced sanctions, or take other regulatory action against RTX, our suppliers, affiliates, or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. Any impact of these or other potential sanctions or other actions by China, is uncertain.\nWe have direct commercial sales contracts for products and services to certain foreign customers, for which U.S. government review and approval have been pending. The U.S. government’s approval of these sales is subject to a range of factors, including its foreign policies related to these customers, which are subject to continuing review and potential changes. Likewise, regulatory approvals previously granted for prior sales can be paused or revoked if the products and services have not yet been delivered to the customer. In addition, certain programs require approvals by foreign governments, and those approvals may not be obtained on a timely basis or at all or may be revoked. If we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approvals, or those approvals are revoked, it could have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe continue to closely monitor potential impacts to RTX’s business, customers, suppliers, employees, and operations in Israel, the Middle East, and the region at large due to the war in Gaza, including a recently-announced ceasefire, the related escalation of conflict and instability in the region, and the regime change in Syria. RTX’s commercial manufacturing facilities in Israel remain open and operational and have continued exporting products and importing critical items and raw materials. RTX’s defense programs’ ability to receive components from Israel has not been impacted in any material respect, although we could experience future delivery delays of certain products if the ceasefire does not hold, or if further escalations arise. The overall impacts to RTX from this situation have been minimal; however, given the volatile nature of the situation, the potential impacts to RTX are subject to change.\n38\nTable of Contents\nOn February 1, 2025, President Trump issued three executive orders directing the United States to impose new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, to take effect on February 4, 2025, and on February 3, 2025, President Trump announced his intention to pause tariffs on Canada and Mexico for the next month. The tariffs impose an additional 25% \nad valorem\n rate of duty on all imports from Canada and Mexico (other than imports of Canadian energy resources exports, which are subject to a 10% \nad valorem\n rate of duty) and an additional 10%\n ad valorem\n rate of duty on all imports from China. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the imposition of the announced tariffs to our business and financial condition. RTX also exports products to Canada, Mexico and China and we are currently monitoring the potential impact, if any, of actions taken in response to these tariffs by Canada, Mexico and China. On January 28, 2025, RTX announced its full-year 2025 financial outlook, and that outlook does not reflect the impact of tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China announced pursuant to the February 1, 2025 executive orders. While we do not believe that the tariffs announced by the United States on February 1, 2025 will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, there may be an impact to our previously issued outlook. The actual impact of the new tariffs is subject to a number of factors including the effective date and duration of such tariffs, changes in the amount, scope and nature of the tariffs in the future, any countermeasures that the target countries may take and any mitigating actions that may become available.\nSee Item 1A. “Risk Factors” within Part I of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nWe use the following key financial performance measures to manage our business on a consolidated basis and by business segment, and to monitor and assess our results of operations:\n•\nNet sales: a metric that measures our revenue for the current year;\n•\nOperating profit: a measure of our profit for the year, before non-operating expenses (income), net and income tax expense;\n•\nOperating profit margin: a measure of our Operating profit as a percentage of Total net sales; and\n•\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations: a measure of the amount of cash generated by our business operations.\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal net sales\n$\n80,738\n \n$\n68,920 \n$\n67,074 \nOperating profit\n6,538\n \n3,561 \n5,504 \nOperating profit margin\n8.1\n \n%\n5.2 \n%\n8.2 \n%\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations\n$\n7,159\n \n$\n7,883 \n$\n7,168 \nIn order to better assess the underlying performance of our business, we also focus on the change in organic net sales on both a consolidated basis and business segment basis, and the change in organic operating profit on a business segment basis, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. See “Results of Operations” below for our definition of the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit, which are non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) measures that are not defined measures under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may be calculated differently by other companies.\nWe also focus on backlog as a key financial performance measure of our forward-looking sales growth. Total backlog was $218 billion and $196 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts). Backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts. \nIn addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash. We focus on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital, such as free cash flow, both of which are non-GAAP measures that are not defined measures under U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies.\nConsidered together, we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareowner value. We also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes.\nA discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in “Results of Operations”, “Segment Review”, and “Liquidity and Financial Condition”.\n39\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs described in our “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results and Risk Factor Summar\ny\n” of this Form 10-K, our period-to-period comparisons of our results, particularly at a segment level, may not be indicative of our future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods, including the discussion of segment results, should be viewed in this context. \nWe provide the organic change in Net sales and Cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations as well as the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit for our segments. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. The organic change in Net sales, Cost of sales, and Operating profit excludes acquisitions and divestitures, net, and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations and other significant non-operational items and/or significant operational items that may occur at irregular intervals (Other). Additionally, the organic change in Cost of sales and Operating profit excludes restructuring costs, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, and costs related to certain acquisition accounting adjustments. Restructuring costs generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), primarily related to our Raytheon segment. Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable.\nNet Sales\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal net sales\n$\n80,738\n \n$\n68,920 \n$\n67,074 \nThe factors contributing to the total change year-over-year in Total net sales are as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nOrganic \n(1)\n$\n7,816\n \n$\n7,343 \nAcquisitions and divestitures, net\n(1,291)\n(143)\nOther\n5,293\n \n(5,354)\nTotal change\n$\n11,818\n \n$\n1,846 \n(1)    See “Results of Operations” for definition of organic.

This was partially offset by a $0.4 billion gain on the sale of Raytheon’s CIS business in the first quarter of 2024, a $0.2 billion benefit from a tax related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024, a $0.1 billion gain on the sale of Collins’ Goodrich Hoist & Winch business in the fourth quarter of 2024, and an insurance recovery at Pratt & Whitney of approximately $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. See “Note 12: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the indemnity receivable and the offsetting impacts to Income tax expense.\nOther income (expense), net in 2023 was relatively consistent with 2022, as the net unfavorable year-over-year impact of foreign exchange gains and losses of $0.1 billion, was more than offset by the absence of $0.1 billion of charges associated with the disposition of three businesses in 2022 and a $0.1 billion gain on sale of land during the first quarter of 2023.

The above items were partially offset by a $0.9 billion charge in the second quarter of 2024 related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters, a $0.6 billion charge in the second quarter of 2024 related to the Raytheon Contract Termination, and the $0.3 billion change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment which is described below in “Segment Review.” See “Note 12: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the indemnity receivable and the offsetting impacts to Income tax expense.\nThe decrease in Operating profit of $1.9 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by a decrease at Pratt & Whitney primarily driven by the $2.9 billion charge associated with the Powder Metal Matter and a decrease in the change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment, partially offset by an increase in Operating profit at Collins and Raytheon, all of which are described below in “Segment Review.”\nNon-service Pension Income\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNon-service pension income\n$\n(1,518)\n$\n(1,780)\n$\n(1,889)\nThe change in Non-service pension income of $0.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by the decrease in the recognized actuarial net (gain) loss as a result of the merger of the remaining Raytheon Company qualified pension plans into the RTX Consolidated Pension Plan at December 31, 2023.\nThe change in Non-service pension income of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by an increase in interest rates during 2022 and prior years’ pension asset returns performing below our expected return on plan assets (EROA) assumption, partially offset by an increase in our 2023 EROA assumption.\nInterest Expense, Net\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInterest expense\n$\n1,970\n \n$\n1,653 \n$\n1,300 \nInterest income\n(102)\n(100)\n(70)\nOther non-operating expense (income) \n(1)\n(6)\n(48)\n46 \nInterest expense, net\n$\n1,862\n \n$\n1,505 \n$\n1,276 \nTotal average interest expense rate - average outstanding borrowings during the year:\n4.6\n \n%\n4.3 \n%\n4.0 \n%\nTotal average interest expense rate - outstanding borrowings as of December 31:\n4.5\n \n%\n4.6 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n(1)    Primarily consists of the gains or losses on assets associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation and employee benefit plans, the gains or losses on liabilities associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation plans, and non-operating dividend income.\nInterest expense, net increased $0.4 billion in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in Interest expense of $0.3 billion was primarily due to long-term debt issuances and term loan borrowings in 2023, partially offset by the reversal of interest accruals as a result of the conclusion of the examination phases of certain RTX and Rockwell Collins tax audits in the first quarter of 2024.\nInterest expense, net increased $0.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in Interest expense of $0.4 billion was primarily due to the long-term debt issuances in the first and the fourth quarters of 2023, interest and fees on short-term loans related to an accelerated share repurchase (ASR), and the increase in commercial paper activity in 2023. The change in Other non-operating expense (income) of $0.1 billion was primarily driven by a change in the mark-to-market fair value of marketable securities held in trusts associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation and employee benefit plans and an increase in dividend income.\nIncome Taxes\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEffective income tax rate\n19.1\n \n%\n11.9 \n%\n12.9 \n%\nThe higher 2024 effective tax rate compared to 2023 is primarily driven by the $2.9 billion Powder Metal Matter pre-tax charge and the associated tax benefit of $663 million recorded in 2023. \nThe 2024 effective tax rate includes $224 million of tax expense associated with the 2024 dispositions. Also included in the 2024 effective tax rate is a $212 million tax charge related to U.S. federal income taxes now owed by the Company resulting from a favorable non-U.S. tax ruling Otis received in 2024. The ruling reduces U.S. foreign tax credits previously claimed by the Company in pre-separation tax years. The Company also recognized a $56 million tax benefit in response to favorable U.S. \n44\nTable of Contents\nTax Court rulings issued to unrelated taxpayers, but with similar facts as ours. Both of these items are subject to a tax matters agreement entered into with Carrier and Otis in connection with the separations of those businesses in 2020. Accordingly, the Company recorded a pre-tax benefit of $212 million for a portion of the indemnity owed by Otis to the Company for the reduction in foreign taxes in the pre-separation years and a pre-tax charge of $32 million for the indemnified amounts payable to Carrier and Otis associated with the $56 million tax benefit. The Company will record the remaining amounts owed by Otis to the Company related to Otis’ non-U.S. ruling upon receipt of the amounts from Otis. Additionally, the Company is indemnified by Otis for the associated interest related to the Otis non-U.S. ruling.\nThe items above are partially offset by a $275 million tax benefit resulting from the conclusion of the examination phases of the U.S. federal income tax audits for RTX 2017 and 2018 tax years and Rockwell Collins 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years, as well as, a $138 million deferred tax benefit associated with legal entity reorganizations. \nThe lower 2023 effective tax rate compared to 2022 is primarily driven by a favorable impact related to the $2.9 billion charge for the Powder Metal Matter and the associated tax benefit of $663 million, and the absence of a $207 million tax benefit recorded in 2022 related to legal entity and operational reorganizations.\nFor additional discussion of income taxes and the effective income tax rate, see “Income Taxes” within Critical Accounting Estimates below, and “Note 12: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNet Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners\n(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners \n$\n4,774\n \n$\n3,195 \n$\n5,216 \nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations\n$\n3.55\n \n$\n2.23 \n$\n3.51 \nNet income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for 2024 includes the following:\n•\nacquisition accounting adjustments of $1.6 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.20;\n•\na charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters of $0.9 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.65;\n•\na charge of $0.4 billion, net of tax, related to the Raytheon Contract Termination, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.33;\n•\nbenefit recognized as a result of the conclusion of the examination phases of the RTX and Rockwell Collins tax audits of $0.3 billion, net of tax, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.21;\n•\na gain on sale of the CIS business, net of transaction and other related costs, of $0.2 billion, net of tax, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.18;\n•\ncharges related to initiating alternative titanium sources at our Collins segment of $0.2 billion, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.13;\n•\nrestructuring charges of $0.2 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.12;\n•\na charge of $0.1 billion, net of tax, related to a customer bankruptcy, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.09;

Segment Total net sales and Operating profit (loss) include intercompany sales and profit, which are ultimately eliminated within Eliminations and other, which also includes certain smaller non-reportable segments. Segment results exclude certain acquisition accounting adjustments, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, and certain corporate expenses, as further discussed below.\nWe present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our Raytheon segment. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally expect to recover the related Raytheon pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt & Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis.\nGiven the nature of our business, we believe that Total net sales and Operating profit (loss) (and the related operating profit (loss) margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management’s view of our segment performance, as described below.\nWe provide the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments as discussed above in “Results of Operations.” We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. For Pratt & Whitney only, Other also includes the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at Pratt & Whitney Canada due to its significance to Pratt & Whitney’s overall operating results.\nTotal Net Sales. \nTotal net sales by segment were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCollins Aerospace\n$\n28,284\n \n$\n26,253 \n$\n23,052 \nPratt & Whitney \n(1)\n28,066\n \n18,296 \n20,530 \nRaytheon\n26,713\n \n26,350 \n25,176 \nTotal segment\n83,063\n \n70,899 \n68,758 \nEliminations and other\n(2,325)\n(1,979)\n(1,684)\nConsolidated\n$\n80,738\n \n$\n68,920 \n$\n67,074 \n(1)    2023 includes the reduction in sales from the Powder Metal Matter.\n46\nTable of Contents\nOperating Profit (Loss). \nOperating profit (loss) by segment was as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCollins Aerospace\n$\n4,135\n \n$\n3,825 \n$\n2,816 \nPratt & Whitney \n(1)\n2,015\n \n(1,455)\n1,075 \nRaytheon\n2,594\n \n2,379 \n2,448 \nTotal segment\n8,744\n \n4,749 \n6,339 \nEliminations and other\n(48)\n(42)\n(23)\nCorporate expenses and other unallocated items \n(2) (3)\n(933)\n(275)\n(318)\nFAS/CAS operating adjustment\n833\n \n1,127 \n1,399 \nAcquisition accounting adjustments\n(2,058)\n(1,998)\n(1,893)\nConsolidated\n$\n6,538\n \n$\n3,561 \n$\n5,504 \n(1)    2023 includes the impacts from the Powder Metal Matter.\n(2)    2022 includes the net expenses related to the U.S. Army’s Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) program.

See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nIncluded in segment Operating profit (loss) are Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments, which relate to changes in Operating profit and margin due to revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion. These changes may reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance, as well as changes in facts and assumptions related to contract options, contract modifications, incentive and award fees associated with program performance, customer activity levels, and other customer-directed changes. For a full description of our EAC process, refer to “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Given that we have thousands of individual contracts, and given the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an on-going basis and the nature of the work required to be performed under our contracts, we have both favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments in the ordinary course.\nWe had the following net EAC adjustments for the periods presented:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet EAC adjustments\n$\n(473)\n$\n(648)\n$\n(37)\nThe change in net EAC adjustments of $0.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to favorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon, partially offset by unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Collins. The change at Pratt was primarily driven by the absence of a $0.1 billion unfavorable impact recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost to our aftermarket contracts resulting from the Powder Metal Matter. The change at Collins was spread across numerous individual programs, with no individual or common significant driver. The change at Raytheon was primarily due to improvement in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts.\nIn addition to the amounts included in the table above, during the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of obtaining critical licenses and further regulatory approvals, we restarted work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer and began recognizing revenue on these contracts. As a result, Raytheon recognized a net operating profit benefit of $0.1 billion primarily related to reserve and contract loss provision adjustments. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2024, Raytheon initiated the termination of a fixed price development contract with a foreign customer (Raytheon Contract Termination) and recognized a $0.6 billion charge related to the impact of the termination. The charge included the write-off of remaining contract assets and the estimated settlement with the customer. The contract termination was completed and customer settlement occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024, in line with previously accrued amounts.  \nThe change in net EAC adjustments of $0.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Pratt & Whitney and to a lesser extent at Collins and Raytheon. Included in the change at Pratt & Whitney was the unfavorable impact of $0.1 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost to our aftermarket contracts resulting from the Powder Metal Matter and an unfavorable impact of approximately $60 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost on a military program. The change in net EAC adjustments at Pratt & Whitney also includes the absence of a $50 million favorable contract adjustment resulting from a contract modification on a commercial aftermarket program in the second quarter of 2022. The change at Collins was spread across numerous individual programs, with no individual or common significant driver. The change at Raytheon was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts and $51 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments related to significant contract options exercised in 2023. \n47\nTable of Contents\nSignificant EAC adjustments, when they occur, are discussed in each business segment’s discussion below.\nBacklog and Bookings. \nTotal backlog was approximately $218 billion and $196 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our backlog by segment, which excludes intercompany backlog, was as follows at December 31:\n(dollars in billions)\n2024\n2023\nCollins Aerospace\n$\n36\n \n$\n30 \nPratt & Whitney\n119\n \n114 \nRaytheon\n63\n \n52 \nTotal backlog\n$\n218\n \n$\n196 \nTotal backlog includes commercial backlog of $125 billion and $118 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and defense backlog of $93 billion and $78 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nBacklog, which is equivalent to our RPO for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). Backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts as discussed further below. \nWe believe bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense businesses. Our defense operations consist primarily of our Raytheon business and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins and Pratt & Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately $61 billion, $51 billion, and $47 billion for 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively. \nDefense bookings generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. Defense bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). We reflect contract cancellations and terminations, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, directly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable. Contract cancellations and terminations also include contract underruns on cost-type programs.\nCollins Aerospace\n% Change\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 compared with 2023\n2023 compared with 2022\nNet sales\n$\n28,284\n \n$\n26,253 \n$\n23,052 \n8\n \n%\n14 \n%\nOperating profit\n4,135\n \n3,825 \n2,816 \n8\n \n%\n36 \n%\nOperating profit margins\n14.6\n \n%\n14.6 \n%\n12.2 \n%\n2024 Compared with 2023\n \nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\nOrganic \n(1)\nAcquisitions /\nDivestitures, net\nRestructuring\nCosts\nOther\nTotal Change\nNet sales\n$\n2,096 \n$\n(18)\n$\n— \n$\n(47)\n$\n2,031 \nOperating profit\n618 \n(3)\n24 \n(329)\n310 \n(1)    See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\n A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n2023 Compared with 2022\n \nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\nOrganic \n(1)\nAcquisitions /\nDivestitures, net\nRestructuring\nCosts\nOther\nTotal Change\nNet sales\n$\n3,173 \n$\n(48)\n$\n— \n$\n76 \n$\n3,201 \nOperating profit\n889 \n(2)\n(50)\n172 \n1,009 \n(1)    See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\n A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n48\nTable of Contents\n2024 Compared with 2023\nThe organic net sales increase of $2.1 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily relates to higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $1.2 billion, higher defense sales of $0.8 billion, and higher commercial aerospace OEM sales of $0.1 billion. The increase in commercial aerospace sales was principally driven by continued growth in commercial air traffic, which has resulted in an increase in flight hours and increased OEM volume primarily within wide-body and regional aircraft, partially offset by decreased OEM volume in narrow-body aircraft. The defense sales increase was primarily due to higher volume across multiple programs and platforms.\nThe organic operating profit increase of $0.6 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.4 billion, principally driven by the higher aftermarket sales volume discussed above, partially offset by unfavorable OEM mix. Defense operating profit increased $0.3 billion 2024 compared to 2023 due to the higher volume discussed above, partially offset by higher space program costs. The above increases were partially offset by $0.1 billion of higher research and development costs.\nThe decrease in Other operating profit of $0.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by $0.2 billion of charges in the first quarter of 2024, related to the recognition of unfavorable purchase commitments and an impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable as a result of initiating alternative titanium sources, $0.2 billion impairment of contract fulfillment costs in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to a contract cancellation, and the absence of net favorable customer settlements recorded in 2023. These decreases in Other operating profit were partially offset by a $0.1 billion net gain on the sale of the Goodrich Hoist & Winch business in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nRestructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts driven by various workforce reductions.\n2023 Compared with 2022\nThe organic net sales increase of $3.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily relates to higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $2.1 billion, including increases across all aftermarket sales channels. These increases were principally driven by the continued recovery of commercial air traffic which resulted in an increase in flight hours. Commercial aerospace OEM sales increased $1.1 billion due to increased production rates in narrow-body, wide-body, and business jets. Military sales were relatively consistent in 2023 compared to 2022.\nThe increase in Other net sales of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to net favorable customer settlements in 2023, including a $0.1 billion favorable customer settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by a $0.1 billion charge related to a customer litigation matter recorded in the third quarter 2023.\nThe organic operating profit increase of $0.9 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher commercial aftermarket volume and favorable mix, partially offset by lower commercial aerospace OEM as drop through on volume was more than offset by higher production costs. This increase in commercial aerospace operating profit was partially offset by $0.2 billion of higher selling, general, and administrative expenses and research and developments costs primarily due to increased employee-related costs. Military operating profit decreased $0.1 billion primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher production costs.\nThe increase in Other operating profit of $0.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the absence of $0.1 billion of pre-tax charges related to global sanctions and export controls with respect to Russia recorded in 2022, the absence of $0.1 billion of charges associated with the disposition of two non-core businesses in 2022, and the net favorable customer settlements discussed above. The above items were partially offset by $0.1 billion of divestiture costs related to the pending sale of our actuation and flight control business. \nSee “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on Russia sanctions. See “Note 2: Acquisitions and Dispositions” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on business dispositions.\nDefense Bookings \n– In addition to a number of smaller bookings in 2024, Collins booked $2.2 billion to support the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation Survivable Airborne Operations Center, $470 million for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control automation system sustainment, and $391 million for F-35 landing gear Lots 18, 19, and 20.\n49\nTable of Contents\nPratt & Whitney\n% Change\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 compared with 2023\n2023 compared with 2022\nNet sales\n$\n28,066\n$\n18,296\n$\n20,530\n53\n \n%\n(11)\n%\nOperating profit (loss)\n2,015\n(1,455)\n1,075\nNM\n(235)\n%\nOperating profit (loss) margins\n7.2\n \n%\n(8.0)\n%\n5.2 \n%\nNM = Not meaningful\n2024 Compared with 2023\n \nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\nOrganic \n(1)\nAcquisitions /\nDivestitures, net\nRestructuring\nCosts\nOther\nTotal Change\nNet sales\n$\n4,386 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n5,384 \n$\n9,770 \nOperating profit (loss)\n559 \n— \n(28)\n2,939 \n3,470 \n(1)    See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\n A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n2023 Compared with 2022\n \nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\nOrganic \n(1)\nAcquisitions /\nDivestitures, net\nRestructuring\nCosts\nOther\nTotal Change\nNet sales\n$\n3,133 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n(5,367)\n$\n(2,234)\nOperating profit (loss)\n410 \n— \n(54)\n(2,886)\n(2,530)\n(1)    See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\n A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n2024 Compared with 2023\n \nThe organic net sales increase of $4.4 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily reflects higher commercial OEM sales of $1.7 billion primarily driven by favorable mix on higher volume and higher commercial aftermarket sales of $1.6 billion primarily driven by higher volume. Military sales increased $1.1 billion, primarily due to higher sustainment and production volume across multiple platforms.\nThe Other net sales increase of $5.4 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily relates to the absence of a charge recognized in the third quarter of 2023 related to the Powder Metal Matter.\nThe organic operating profit increase of $0.6 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 reflects higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.4 billion driven by favorable mix on higher large commercial OEM volume which was partially offset by higher OEM production costs. Commercial aerospace operating profit also benefited from higher commercial aftermarket volume, which was partially offset by the impact of a shift in aftermarket mix towards higher GTF volume as well as two favorable contract matters in 2023 totaling $0.1 billion that did not repeat in 2024. The increase in military operating profit of $0.2 billion was driven by the increases from the sales volume discussed above, as well as favorable sustainment mix, partially offset by higher production costs. Military operating profit also benefited from the absence of an unfavorable EAC adjustment of approximately $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was partially offset by an unfavorable EAC adjustment of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. \nHigher research and development expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses were partially offset by an insurance recovery of approximately $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe change in Other operating profit (loss) of $2.9 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 reflects the absence of a charge recognized in the third quarter of 2023 related to the Powder Metal Matter of $2.9 billion and a $0.2 billion charge related to a customer insolvency in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by a $0.2 billion charge related to a customer bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nRestructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts including workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities.\n2023 Compared with 2022\nThe organic net sales increase of $3.1 billion in \n2023 compared to 2022\n primarily reflects \nhigher commercial aftermarket sales of $1.9 billion, primarily due to an increase in volume, content, and favorable mix. The increase also includes higher commercial OEM sales of $0.9 billion, primarily driven by higher volume and favorable mix. Military sales increased $0.3 billion, primarily due to higher F135 sustainment volume.\n50\nTable of Contents\nThe Other net sales decrease of $5.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the charge recognized in the third quarter of 2023 related to the Powder Metal Matter.\nThe organic operating profit increase of $0.4 billion in \n2023 compared to 2022\n was primarily driven by \nhigher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.6 billion, principally due to the aftermarket sales increase discussed above, partially offset by lower commercial OEM operating profit as the OEM volume increase combined with higher production costs more than offset the benefit from favorable mix. Commercial aerospace operating profit in 2023 also benefited from two favorable contract matters totaling $0.1 billion, which was partially offset by the absence of a prior year $50 million favorable contract adjustment resulting from a contract modification on a commercial aftermarket contract. Military operating profit was relatively consistent compared to 2022. The increase from the military sales volume was more than offset by higher production costs and an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Higher research and development expenses were partially offset by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n \nThe change in Other operating profit (loss) of $2.9 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the charge recognized in the third quarter of 2023 related to the Powder Metal Matter of $2.9 billion and a $0.2 billion charge related to a customer insolvency during the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by the absence of $0.2 billion of pre-tax charges recorded in the first quarter of 2022 related to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on Russia sanctions.\nDefense Bookings \n– In addition to a number of smaller bookings, in 2024 Pratt & Whitney booked $2.3 billion for F117 sustainment, $2.2 billion for F135 sustainment, $1.5 billion for F135 ECU development, $729 million for F135 production, and $475 million for F119 sustainment.\nRaytheon\n% Change\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 compared with 2023\n2023 compared with 2022\nNet sales\n$\n26,713\n$\n26,350 \n$\n25,176 \n1\n \n%\n5 \n%\nOperating profit\n2,594\n2,379 \n2,448 \n9\n \n%\n(3)\n%\nOperating profit margins\n9.7\n \n%\n9.0 \n%\n9.7 \n%\nDefense Bookings\n$\n39,235\n$\n31,889 \n$\n30,479 \n23\n \n%\n5 \n%\n2024 Compared with 2023\n \nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\nOrganic \n(1)\nAcquisitions /\nDivestitures, net\nRestructuring\nCosts\nOther\nTotal Change\nNet sales\n$\n1,691 \n$\n(1,274)\n$\n— \n$\n(54)\n$\n363 \nOperating Profit\n352 \n(74)\n6 \n(69)\n215 \n(1)    See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\n A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n2023 Compared with 2022\n \nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\nOrganic \n(1)\nAcquisitions /\nDivestitures, net\nRestructuring\nCosts\nOther\nTotal Change\nNet sales\n$\n1,292 \n$\n(95)\n$\n— \n$\n(23)\n$\n1,174 \nOperating Profit\n(58)\n— \n(34)\n23 \n(69)\n(1)    See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\n A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n2024 Compared with 2023\nThe organic net sales increase of $1.7 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher net sales of $1.4 billion from land and air defense systems programs driven by higher net sales on certain international Patriot programs, certain international National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) programs, and Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) programs. Also contributing to the increase was higher net sales of $0.4 billion from advanced technology programs primarily driven by higher volume on classified programs and on a development program. Additionally, the organic net sales increase includes $0.3 billion of sales associated with the restart of certain contracts with a Middle East customer. \n51\nTable of Contents\nThese increases were partially offset by lower net sales of $0.5 billion from air and space defense systems programs primarily due to the completion of certain programs, and the timing of a prior year program award.\nThe decrease in Other net sales in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by $0.1 billion related to the Raytheon Contract Termination initiated in the second quarter of 2024.\nThe organic operating profit increase of $0.4 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher volume of $0.2 billion primarily driven by the net sales increases noted above and an improvement in net EAC adjustments of $0.2 billion. The change in net EAC adjustments was primarily due to improvement in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts. Included in the change in net EAC adjustments was a benefit from the absence of a $51 million unfavorable adjustment in 2023 related to significant contract options exercised, which was offset by a $53 million unfavorable EAC adjustment in the third quarter of 2024 related to cost increases on a classified program.\nThe decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily relates to the sale of the CIS business completed in the first quarter of 2024.\nThe decrease in Other operating profit in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by $0.6 billion related to the Raytheon Contract Termination initiated in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a $0.4 billion gain on the sale of the CIS business in the first quarter of 2024, and a $0.1 billion net benefit primarily related to reserve and contract loss provision adjustments recognized in the fourth quarter of 2024 as a result of restarting work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer.\n2023 Compared with 2022\nThe organic net sales increase of $1.3 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher net sales of $0.5 billion from advanced technology programs, $0.3 billion from air and space defense systems programs, $0.2 billion from cybersecurity, intelligence and services programs, and $0.2 billion from naval power programs. The increase in advanced technology programs includes higher net sales on an advanced development program awarded in the third quarter of 2022, and higher net sales on certain classified programs awarded in 2022. The increase in air and space defense systems programs includes higher net sales on the StormBreaker program, driven by awards in the first and fourth quarters of 2023 and higher net sales on the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) program, driven by an award in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in cybersecurity, intelligence and services programs was driven by certain classified programs as well as federal and civil programs. The increase in naval power programs was due to higher volumes on Naval Strike Missile and AIM-9X programs.\nThe organic operating profit decrease of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to an unfavorable change in mix and other performance of $0.1 billion, and an unfavorable net change in EAC adjustments of $0.1 billion, partially offset by higher volume of $0.2 billion. The unfavorable change in mix and other performance was primarily driven by an expected decline in certain higher margin international programs and higher volume on various lower margin programs including early production phase programs. The net change in EAC adjustments was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts and approximately $50 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments related to significant contract options exercised in 2023. The increase in volume was principally driven by the higher net sales discussed above.\nThe increase in Other operating profit in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by the absence of a $42 million charge in 2022 associated with a divestiture of a small non-core naval power business, with the remaining change spread across multiple items.\nThe decrease in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily relates to the divestiture of a small non-core naval power business in the first quarter of 2023.\nRestructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts including workforce reductions.\nDefense Backlog and Bookings\n– Backlog was $63 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to $52 billion at December 31, 2023. Included in the change in backlog was a $1.1 billion reduction related to the sale of the CIS business and a $0.9 billion increase related to restarting work on certain contracts with a Middle East customer, as discussed above. In addition to a number of smaller bookings, in 2024, Raytheon booked $2.4 billion to provide Patriot Air Defense systems to Germany, $1.9 billion for low-rate initial production of LTAMDS for the U.S. Army and Poland, $1.6 billion to provide Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) to the U.S. Navy and international customers, $1.4 billion to provide Guidance Enhanced Missiles (GEM-T) for NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), $1.2 billion to provide AMRAAM to the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and international customers, $1.0 billion to provide Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM) for the U.S. Navy and international consortium partners, $848 million to provide Patriot Air Defense systems, including GEM-T missiles, to Romania, $763 million to provide Stinger missiles to NSPA and Poland, $737 million to provide AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles for the U.S. Navy, \n52\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Air Force, and international customers, $639 million to produce AN/SPY-6(V) radars for the U.S. Navy, $623 million to provide GEM-T for an international customer, $591 million for Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band (NGJ-MB) for the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force, $538 million to provide Javelin for the U.S. Army and international customers, $530 million to provide Patriot launchers for Poland, $479 million to provide GEM-T for an international customer, $473 million for an Advanced Tactical Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) system for the U.S. Air Force, $453 million to provide GEM-T for an international customer, $393 million to design and build the Landsat Next Instrument Suite (LandIS) for NASA, $333 million to provide Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) for the U.S. Navy, $301 million to provide Tomahawk to the U.S. Navy and international customers, $282 million to provide Stormbreaker to the U.S. Air Force, $282 million to provide NASAMS for Ukraine, $272 million for Standard Missile II (SM-2) provisioned items and ordered spares for the U.S. Navy, $251 million to provide GEM-T for an international customer, and $5.7 billion on a number of classified contracts.\nCorporate and Eliminations and other\nEliminations and other reflects the elimination of sales, other income, and operating profit transacted between segments, as well as the operating results of certain smaller operations. \nCorporate expenses and other unallocated items consists of costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of reportable segment operating performance, including certain unallowable costs and reserves. In addition, in 2022, net costs associated with corporate research and development related to the LTAMDS program were included in Corporate expenses and other unallocated items. Beginning in 2023, the remaining net costs associated with the LTAMDS program are reflected within the Raytheon segment.\nNet Sales\nOperating Profit\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEliminations and other\n$\n(2,325)\n$\n(1,979)\n$\n(1,684)\n$\n(48)\n$\n(42)\n$\n(23)\nCorporate expenses and other unallocated items\n—\n \n— \n— \n(933)\n(275)\n(318)\nThe increase in eliminations and other net sales of $0.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by Collins. Eliminations and other operating profit in 2024 was relatively consistent with 2023.\nThe increase in eliminations and other net sales of $0.3 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by Collins. Eliminations and other operating profit in 2023 was relatively consistent with 2022.\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $0.7 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to a $0.9 billion charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters recorded in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a $0.2 billion benefit from a tax related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $43 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to the LTAMDS program, which are included in the Raytheon segment beginning in 2023, partially offset by an increase in costs related to our segment realignment in 2023, with the remaining change spread across multiple items.\nFAS/CAS operating adjustment\nThe segment results of Raytheon include pension and PRB expense as determined under U.S. government CAS, which we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. The difference between our CAS expense and the FAS service cost attributable to these segments under U.S. GAAP is the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment results in consolidated pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of FAS expense under U.S. GAAP. The segment results of Collins and Pratt & Whitney generally include FAS service cost.\nThe CAS expense calculation is different from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension expense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost and amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. Unlike FAS, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded on a CAS basis. Consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly.\n53\nTable of Contents\nThe components of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFAS service cost (expense)\n$\n(138)\n$\n(145)\n$\n(336)\nCAS expense\n971\n \n1,272 \n1,735 \nFAS/CAS operating adjustment\n$\n833\n \n$\n1,127 \n$\n1,399 \nThe change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $0.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was driven by a decrease in CAS expense, primarily due to the recognition of historical CAS gain/loss experience. \nThe change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $0.3 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was driven by a $0.5 billion decrease in CAS expense, partially offset by a $0.2 billion decrease in FAS service cost. The decrease in CAS expense was primarily due to changes to the Raytheon Company domestic pension plans announced in December 2020 that were effective December 31, 2022, and the recognition of historical CAS gain/loss experience. Similarly, the decrease in FAS service cost was primarily due to changes to the Raytheon Company domestic pension plans announced in December 2020 that were effective December 31, 2022. Refer to “Note 10: Employee Benefit Plans” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Raytheon Company domestic pension plan change.\nAcquisition accounting adjustments\nAcquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss-making or below-market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable. These adjustments are not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment results.\nThe components of Acquisition accounting adjustments were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmortization of acquired intangibles \n$\n(2,095)\n$\n(2,021)\n$\n(1,912)\nAmortization of property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment\n(44)\n(60)\n(89)\nAmortization of customer contractual obligations related to acquired loss-making and below-market contracts\n81\n \n83 \n108 \nAcquisition accounting adjustments\n$\n(2,058)\n$\n(1,998)\n$\n(1,893)\nAcquisition accounting adjustments related to acquisitions in each segment were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCollins Aerospace\n$\n(833)\n$\n(854)\n$\n(865)\nPratt & Whitney\n(312)\n(287)\n(243)\nRaytheon\n(913)\n(857)\n(785)\nAcquisition accounting adjustments\n$\n(2,058)\n$\n(1,998)\n$\n(1,893)\nAcquisition accounting adjustments in 2024 and 2023 were relatively consistent with 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n5,578\n \n$\n6,587 \nTotal debt\n41,261\n \n43,827 \nTotal equity\n61,923\n \n61,410 \nTotal capitalization (total debt plus total equity)\n103,184\n \n105,237 \nTotal debt to total capitalization\n40\n \n%\n42 \n%\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities and the timing of such activities. Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, customer financing requirements, investments in and divestitures of businesses, dividends, common stock repurchases, pension funding, access to \n54\nTable of Contents\nthe commercial paper markets, adequacy of available bank lines of credit, redemptions of debt, and the ability to attract long-term capital at satisfactory terms. \nAt December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.6 billion, of which 41% was held by RTX’s foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The Company intends to repatriate certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. Taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings have been recorded. For the remainder of the Company’s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, RTX will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. \nOur ability to access global debt markets and the related cost of these borrowings depends on the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our S&P Global credit rating remains at BBB+/negative, and our Moody’s Investors Service outlook is Baa1/negative. Though the Company expects to continue having adequate access to funds, declines in our credit ratings or Company outlook could result in higher borrowing costs.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $5.0 billion, which expires in August 2028. As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement. In addition, at December 31, 2024, approximately $0.7 billion was available under short-term lines of credit primarily with global banks at our international subsidiaries.\nFrom time to time, we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments, and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 364 days from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2024, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2024.\nThere were no issuances of long-term debt during 2024. During 2024, we made the following repayments of long-term debt:\nDate\nDescription of Notes\nAggregate Principal Balance (in millions)\nDecember 24, 2024\n3 Month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 1.225% Term Loan due 2025\n$\n500\n \nDecember 15, 2024\n3.150% notes due 2024\n300\n \nMay 7, 2024\n3 Month SOFR plus 1.225% term loan due 2025\n250\n \nApril 17, 2024\n3 Month SOFR plus 1.225% term loan due 2025\n250\n \nApril 4, 2024\n3 Month SOFR plus 1.225% term loan due 2025\n250\n \nMarch 15, 2024\n3.200% notes due 2024\n950\n \nWe have an existing universal shelf registration statement, which we filed with the \nSEC\n on September 22, 2022, for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance, subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement. \nThe Company offers voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) programs with global financial institutions which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institutions at a rate that leverages our credit rating, which might be beneficial to them. Our suppliers’ participation in the SCF programs does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers, and therefore, we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the programs. In addition, we do not pay for any of the costs of the programs incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate, and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to sales of receivables made by those suppliers. As such, the SCF programs do not impact our working capital, cash flows, or overall liquidity.\nWe believe our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, as well as the availability under committed credit lines, provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCash Flow - Operating Activities\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations\n$\n7,159\n \n$\n7,883 \n$\n7,168 \n2024 Compared with 2023 Operating Activities \nNet income from continuing operations in 2024 included charges of $0.9 billion related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters and $0.4 billion related to the Raytheon Contract Termination, net of tax. Net income from continuing operations in 2023 included a $2.2 billion charge related to the Powder Metal Matter, net of tax. The Powder Metal Matter also had the effect of increasing Other accrued liabilities by $2.8 billion in 2023. Utilization of Other accrued liabilities in 2024 related to this matter were $1.0 billion and represent cash paid and credits issued to customers. During 2024, we also paid a combined $1.5 billion related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters and the Raytheon Contract Termination.\nAdditionally, a favorable impact from accounts receivable collections, including the related impact of factoring as discussed below, and a favorable change in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities driven by timing of payments and an increase in material purchases, partially offset by the net change in contract assets and contract liabilities, primarily at Pratt & Whitney, due to sales in excess of billings, contributed to an increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2024 compared to 2023. Excluding the charges discussed above, higher net income from continuing operations after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax benefit, stock compensation cost, net periodic pension and other postretirement income, and gain on sale of business also contributed to an increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by the operating performance of our segments.\nThe Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables. Factoring activity resulted in an increase of $0.1 billion in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during \n2024\n, compared to a decrease of $0.8 billion in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during \n2023\n.\n2023 Compared with 2022 Operating Activities \nNet income from continuing operations in \n2023 included a \n$2.2 billion charge related to the Powder Metal Matter, net of tax, which had no effect on cash flow in the period. This charge also had the effect of increasing Other accrued liabilities by $2.8 billion in \n2023\n. Excluding the impact of this charge, the favorable change in cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations in \n2023\n compared to \n2022\n, is primarily driven by higher net income from continuing operations after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax benefit, stock compensation cost, and net periodic pension and other postretirement income. Also contributing to the change in cash flows is a net favorable impact of net contract assets and liabilities due to the timing of collections, a net decrease in tax payments further discussed below, and lower inventory receipts compared to 2022. These favorable changes were partially offset by higher accounts receivable as a result of increased sales volume and timing of collections and a decrease in factoring.\n \nThe Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables. Factoring activity resulted in a decrease of $0.8 billion in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during 2023, compared to an increase of $2.3 billion in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during 2022. Factoring activity included amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customers’ request for which we may be compensated by the customer\nOperating Activities\nWe made pension and PRB contributions to trusts of $0.1 billion, $0.2 billion, and $0.1 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Included in the 2023 contributions is a discretionary noncash contribution of $50 million made in RTX common stock to our U.S. qualified pension plans. \nWe make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions are primarily determined by \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)\n funding rules, which require us to fully fund our U.S qualified pension plans over a rolling fifteen-year period as determined annually based on the calculated funded status at the beginning of each year per the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and subsequent amendments. The funding requirements are primarily based on the year’s expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities, which are dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates, and actuarial assumptions. \n56\nTable of Contents\nGlobal pension and PRB cash funding requirements are expected to be approximately $0.3 billion in 2025, which includes benefit payments to be paid directly by the Company. We can contribute cash or RTX shares to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations. As of December 31, 2024, the total investment by the U.S. qualified pension plans in RTX shares was less than 1% of total plan assets.\nOur domestic defined contribution plan uses an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) for certain employer matching contributions. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we expanded the use of ESOP shares to fund our matching contributions to additional participants who had previously received matching contributions in cash.\nWe made net income tax payments of $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion, and $2.4 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. A provision enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 related to the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes became effective on January 1, 2022. As such, we made incremental income tax payments of $1.6 billion in 2022. In September and December 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued interim guidance, retroactive to 2022, clarifying the capitalization requirements for certain types of research and experimental expenditures. The Company’s analysis indicates the guidance provided in the notices will result in fewer costs being subject to capitalization, and as such, costs previously required to be capitalized are now deductible in the year incurred. These notices resulted in the Company making lower income tax payments in 2023 compared to 2022.\nIncluded in cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations are payments related to our operating lease obligations. See “Note 11: Leases” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for actual and expected payments on operating lease obligations.\nIn addition, the majority of our cash flows for purchase obligations are classified as cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations. We expect future payments related to our purchase obligations to be $40.1 billion, of which $25.5 billion is payable in 2025. Purchase obligations include current amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders, and do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future. Approximately 50% of our purchase obligations described above represent purchase orders for products to be delivered under firm contracts with the U.S. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.\nWhile the timing of cash flows are subject to a number of variables, for the Powder Metal Matter we estimate the accrual for expected customer compensation to be utilized consistent with the timing of execution of the fleet management plan, the period of increased aircraft on ground levels, and contractual terms with customers. We currently estimate a full year 2025 cash impact related to the Powder Metal Matter of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which includes the impact of cash paid, customer credits applied and the timing of partner recovery.\nCash Flow - Investing Activities\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations\n$\n(1,534)\n$\n(3,039)\n$\n(2,829)\nOur investing activities primarily include capital expenditures, cash investments in customer financing assets, investments in and dispositions of businesses, payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, and settlements of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments.\n2024 Compared with 2023 Investing Activities\nThe $1.5 billion change in cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily related to the cash proceeds from the sale of our CIS business within our Raytheon segment and the sale of our Goodrich Hoist & Winch business within our Collins segment of approximately $1.3 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively.\n2023 Compared with 2022 Investing Activities\nThe $0.2 billion change in cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily related to an increase in payments for intangible assets discussed below and capital expenditures primarily due to investments in production facilities at Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon, partially offset by the timing of our derivative contract settlements.\nInvesting Activities\nThere were no significant acquisitions in 2024, 2023, or 2022. For information on dispositions of businesses in 2024, 2023, or 2022, see above or “Note 2: Acquisitions and Dispositions” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n57\nTable of Contents\nIn 2024, 2023, and 2022 our intangible assets increased by $0.6 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.5 billion, respectively, primarily related to collaboration payment commitments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE) and exclusivity payments made on contractual commitments included within intangible assets. At December 31, 2024, we had commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments, including exclusivity and collaboration payment commitments, of approximately $14.1 billion, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners’ share. Refer to “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details on our commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments.\nAs discussed in “Note 13: Financial Instruments” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we enter into derivative instruments primarily for risk management purposes, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing, and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts, and options, to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate, and commodity price exposures. During 2024 and 2022, we had net cash payments of $142 million and $205 million, respectively and had net cash receipts of $14 million during 2023, from the settlement of these derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. \nCash Flow - Financing Activities\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations\n$\n(6,617)\n$\n(4,527)\n$\n(5,859)\nOur financing activities primarily include the issuance and repayment of commercial paper and other short-term and long-term debt, payment of dividends, and share repurchases.\n2024 Compared with 2023 Financing Activities\nThe $2.1 billion increase in cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2024 compared to the 2023 was primarily driven by higher year-over-year long-term debt repayments of $1.9 billion. Prior year long-term debt proceeds of $12.9 billion were partially offset by lower year-over-year share repurchases of $12.4 billion, primarily related to the prior year ASR.\n2023 Compared with 2022 Financing Activities\nThe $1.3 billion decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by long-term debt proceeds of $12.9 billion, partially offset by higher share repurchases of $10.1 billion primarily related to the ASR, an increase in repayment of commercial paper borrowings, net of $1.0 billion, and repayments of long-term debt of $0.6 billion.\nFinancing Activities\nIncluded in cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations are principal payments related to our long-term debt. A summary of our long-term debt commitments, including interest payments which are included in cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations, as of December 31, 2024 was as follows:\n \nPayments Due by Period\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2026\n2027\nThereafter\nLong-term debt—principal\n$\n2,343 \n$\n4,505 \n$\n2,937 \n$\n31,361 \nLong-term debt—future interest\n$\n1,848 \n$\n1,741 \n$\n1,491 \n$\n18,238 \nAt December 31, 2024, management had remaining authority to repurchase approximately $0.7 billion of our common stock under the October 21, 2023 share repurchase program.

Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates.\nLong-Term Contract Accounting. \nWe recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace aftermarket contracts. We measure progress toward completion of these contracts on a percentage-of-completion basis, generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management’s judgment. We review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. For significant contracts, we review our EACs more frequently. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs, and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenues and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials including any impact from changing costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. In particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant management judgment, as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost changes. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage-of-completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also \n59\nTable of Contents\ninclude the establishment of, and changes to, loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis. \nNet EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results:\n(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal net sales\n$\n(144)\n$\n(452)\n$\n152 \nOperating profit (loss)\n(473)\n(648)\n(37)\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners \n(1)\n(374)\n(512)\n(29)\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners \n(1)\n$\n(0.28)\n$\n(0.36)\n$\n(0.02)\n(1)    Amounts reflect a U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, which approximates our tax rate on our EAC adjustments.\nIn addition to the amounts included in the table above, during the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of obtaining critical licenses and further regulatory approvals, we restarted work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer and began recognizing revenue on these contracts. As a result, Raytheon recognized a net operating profit benefit of $0.1 billion primarily related to reserve and contract loss provision adjustments. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2024, Raytheon initiated the termination of a fixed price development contract with a foreign customer (Raytheon Contract Termination) and recognized a $0.6 billion charge related to the impact of the termination. The charge included the write-off of remaining contract assets and the estimated settlement with the customer. The contract termination was completed and customer settlement occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024, in line with previously accrued amounts.  \nCosts incurred for engineering and development of certain aerospace products under contracts with customers are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs, to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. The estimation of contract costs, and margin, considered as part of this recoverability assessment requires significant judgment. We regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment. In 2024, we recognized impairment charges of $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion at Collins due to a contract cancellation and as a result of the impact of initiating alternative titanium sources, respectively. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. \nIncome Taxes. \nManagement believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits, which may be realized over an extended period of time. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, projections of future taxable income, the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies, and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. Our projections of future taxable income include estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing, and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates, and future taxable income levels. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made. \nIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. Significant judgment is required when assessing our income tax positions and in determining our tax expense and benefits. Management assesses our tax positions based on an evaluation of the facts, circumstances, applicable tax laws, including regulations, case law, and other interpretive guidance, as well as any other relevant information. Adjustments to our tax positions are made as new information becomes available or when our assessments change. In addition, we have entered into certain internal legal entity restructuring transactions necessary to effectuate the separation of Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis). We have accrued tax on these transactions based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and our determination of appropriate entity valuations. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” and “Note 12: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nManagement has determined that the distributions of Carrier and Otis on April 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions, qualified as tax-free under applicable law. In making these determinations, we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, \n60\nTable of Contents\nand/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity in future reporting periods.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. \nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, developed technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. The fair value for acquired customer relationship intangibles is determined as of the acquisition date based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the future after-tax cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details.\nAlso included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets, which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms. At December 31, 2024, our exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $3.3 billion, and our remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, were approximately $5.5 billion. We assess the recoverability of these intangibles, which is dependent upon our assumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms, including the associated aftermarket revenue streams, and the related future cash flows.\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In testing our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. For the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill, we primarily utilize a combination of discounted cash flows and market-based valuation methodologies. For the quantitative assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is primarily based on the relief from royalty method. These quantitative assessments incorporate significant assumptions that include sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions. \nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. We assessed all of our reporting units using qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that any individual reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value (step 0) and determined that no further testing was required. \nThe Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact our significant assumptions used in testing goodwill, including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company’s market capitalization, and general industry, market, and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances, or in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, could require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge. \nWe also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing using a qualitative approach as of October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of these assets were necessary. As noted above, our indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis involves significant assumptions that are subject to variability. Material changes in these assumptions could occur and result in impairments in future periods.\nContingent Liabilities. \nAs described in “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, contractual, regulatory, and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation, including with respect to matters relating to technical issues on programs, government contracts, performance and operating cost guarantees, employee benefit plans, legal, and environmental, health, and safety matters. In particular, the design, development, production, and support of aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these technolog\nies may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance e\nstimates. These impacts could be \n61\nTable of Contents\nmaterial to the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, we have significant contracts with the U.S. government, subject to government oversight and audit, which may require significant adjustment of contract prices. We accrue for liabilities associated with these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Estimating our liability based on both the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes, and the costs associated with these matters, requires significant judgment. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters could result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution. \nIn 2023, Pratt & Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100 GTF fleet, which powers the A320neo. This determination was made pursuant to Pratt & Whitney’s safety management system. \nOn August 4, 2023, Pratt & Whitney issued a special instruction (SI) to operators of PW1100 GTF powered A320neo aircraft, which required accelerated inspections and engine removals covering an initial subset of operational engines, no later than September 15, 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, through its safety management system, Pratt & Whitney continued its engineering and industrial assessment, which resulted in an updated fleet management plan for the remaining PW1100 fleet. This updated plan requires a combination of part inspections and retirements for some high pressure turbine and high pressure compressor parts made from affected raw material. Guidance to affected operators was released via service bulletins (SB) and SI in November 2023, and this guidance has been reflected in airworthiness directives issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Consistent with previous information, the actions are resulting in significant incremental shop visits. \nAs a result of this matter, Pratt & Whitney expects aircraft on ground levels for the PW1100 powered A320neo fleet to remain elevated through 2026. As a result of anticipated increased aircraft on ground levels and expected compensation to customers for this disruption, as well as incremental maintenance costs resulting from increased inspections and shop visits, Pratt & Whitney recorded a pre-tax operating profit charge in the third quarter of 2023 of $2.9 billion, reflecting Pratt & Whitney’s net 51% program share of the PW1100 program. This amount reflected our best estimate of expected customer compensation for the estimated duration of the disruption as well as the EAC adjustment impact of this matter to Pratt & Whitney’s long-term maintenance contracts. The incremental costs to the business’s long-term maintenance contracts include the estimated cost of additional inspections, replacement of parts, and other related impacts.\nThe charge recorded in the third quarter of 2023 resulted in a net increase in Other accrued liabilities of $2.8 billion, which principally related to our 51% share of an accrual for expected customer compensation. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had other accrued liabilities of $1.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, primarily related to expected compensation to customers. The decrease in the accrual during 2024 was primarily due to customer compensation in the form of credits issued and cash paid to customers during the period.\nOther engine models within Pratt & Whitney’s fleet contain parts manufactured with affected powder metal, but we do not currently believe there will be any resultant significant financial impact with respect to these other engine models at this time. The financial impact of the powder metal issue is based on historical experience and is subject to various assumptions and judgments, most notably, the number and expected timing of shop visits, inspection results and scope of work to be performed, turnaround time, availability of parts, available capacity at overhaul facilities, and outcomes of negotiations with impacted customers. While these assumptions reflect our best estimates at this time, they are subject to variability. Potential changes to these assumptions and actual incurred costs could significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements and could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations for the periods in which they are recognized.\nEmployee Benefit Plans.\n We sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and PRB plans. Assumptions used to calculate our funded status are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators. They are evaluated annually at December 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. A change in any of these assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions are subject to recognition in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAssumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans require judgement. Major assumptions include the discount rate and EROA. Other assumptions include mortality rates, demographic assumptions (such as retirement age), rate of increase in employee compensation levels, and health care cost increase projections.\nThe weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and PRB liabilities are generally based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds which are subject to macroeconomic factors, as well as plan specific expected cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows. \n62\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and PRB plan liabilities and net periodic benefit income to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations, interest cost, and service cost as of December 31, 2024:\n(dollars in millions)\nIncrease in Discount \nRate of 25 bps\nDecrease in Discount \nRate of 25 bps\nProjected benefit obligation increase (decrease)\n$\n(1,024)\n$\n1,066\n \nNet periodic benefit income increase (decrease)\n(42)\n45\n \nThe discount rate sensitivities assume no change in the shape of the yield curve that will be applied to the projected cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost. A flattening of the yield curve results in a narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would decrease our net periodic benefit income. Conversely, a steepening of the yield curve would result in an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would increase our net periodic benefit income.\nThe EROA is the average rate of earnings expected over the long-term on assets invested to fund anticipated future benefit payment obligations. In determining the EROA assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions. Return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads, and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. Differences between actual asset returns in a given year and the EROA do not necessarily indicate a change in the assumption is required, as the EROA represents the expected average returns over a long-term horizon.\nNet periodic benefit income is also sensitive to changes in the EROA. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the EROA would have increased or decreased our 2024 Net periodic benefit income by approximately $131 million.\nRefer to “Note 10: Employee Benefit Plans” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of current and prior year discount rate and EROA assumptions.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the Accounting Pronouncements section in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nRefer to “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion on contractual commitments and contingencies.\nGOVERNMENT MATTERS\nAs described above in “Critical Accounting Estimates—Contingent Liabilities,” our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audits. Such audits may recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld. We are also the subject of one or more investigations and legal proceedings initiated by the U.S. government with respect to government contract matters. In addition, as described in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, in 2024, the Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the DOJ and the Company settled an administrative proceeding with the SEC (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS) since 2012, in connection with certain Middle East contracts. The Company also entered into a DPA and a FCA settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017. Under these DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain, among other things, an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged) and are required to undertake certain cooperation and disclosure obligations (for a term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company’s and the Company’s compliance with their respective obligations under the DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order. In 2024, the Company also resolved certain voluntarily disclosed export controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser extent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a Consent Agreement (CA) with the DOS. The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company to implement remedial compliance measures and to conduct an external audit of the Company’s ITAR compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external, independent Special Compliance \n63\nTable of Contents\nOfficer (SCO). The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. See “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these and other government matters.",
