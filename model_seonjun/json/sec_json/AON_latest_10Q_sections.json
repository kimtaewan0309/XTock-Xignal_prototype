The increase reflects 7% organic revenue growth and a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other items. Risk Capital revenue increased $170 million, or 7%, to $2.5 billion and Human Capital revenue increased $106 million, or 8%, to $1.5 billion compared to the prior year period. For the first nine months of 2025, Revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 12%, to $12.9 billion compared to the prior year period. The increase reflects the contribution from NFP and 6% organic revenue growth.\n Risk Capital revenue \nincreased $602 million, or 8%, to $8.6 billion and Human Capital revenue increased $714 million, or 20%, to $4.3 billion compared to the prior year period.\n•\nOperating expenses increased $83 million, or 3%, to $3.2 billion compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in expense associated with 7% organic revenue growth and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by lower Accelerating Aon United program expenses, $35 million of net restructuring savings and a reduction in integration costs related to NFP. Risk Capital operating expenses increased $146 million, or 8%, to $1.9 billion and Human Capital operating expenses decreased $24 million, or 2%, to $1.1 billion compared to the prior year period. For the first nine months of 2025, Operating expenses increased $938 million, or 11%, to $9.7 billion compared to the prior year period due primarily to the inclusion of NFP’s ongoing expenses, an increase in intangible asset amortization associated with the NFP acquisition and other acquisitions completed in the year, an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth and investments in long-term growth, partially offset by $110 million of net restructuring savings and transaction costs incurred in the prior year period. Risk Capital operating expenses increased $486 million, or 9%, to $5.9 billion and Human Capital operating expenses increased $541 million, or 19%, to $3.5 billion compared to the prior year period.\n•\nOperating margin increased to 20.4% from 16.7% in the prior year period, driven by organic revenue growth of 7% and $35 million of net restructuring savings, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as previously described. Risk Capital operating margin decreased to 23.2% from 23.8% and Human Capital operating margin increased to 22.5% from 14.8% compared to the prior year period. For the first nine months of 2025, Operating margin increased to 24.3% from 23.8% in the prior year period, driven primarily by organic revenue growth of 6% and $110 million of net restructuring savings, partially offset by the inclusion of ongoing operating expenses from NFP and an increase in operating expenses related to organic growth as previously described. Risk Capital operating margin decreased to 30.8% from 31.7% and Human Capital operating margin increased to 19.8% from 18.9% compared to the prior year period. \n•\nDue to the factors set forth above, Net income increased $115 million, or 32%, to $470 million compared to the prior year period. For the first nine months of 2025, Net income increased $60 million, or 3%, to $2.0 billion compared to the prior year period.\n•\nDiluted earnings per share was $2.11 compared to $1.57 per share for the prior year period. For the first nine months of 2025, Diluted earnings per share was $9.21 compared to $9.20 per share for the prior year period.\n•\nCash flows provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion for the first nine months of 2025, an increase of $249 million, or 14%, from $1.8 billion in the prior year period, \nprimarily due to strong adjusted operating income growth and lower NFP-related transaction costs, partially offset by higher payments related to incentive compensation, interest and restructuring. \n35\nWe focus on four key metrics that are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP metrics should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics for the third quarter of 2025:\n•\nOrganic revenue growth, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Organic Revenue Growth,” was 7% for the third quarter of 2025 and 6% for the first nine months of 2025, driven by net new business and ongoing strong retention.\n•\nAdjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Operating Margin,” was 26.3% for the third quarter of 2025 compared to 24.6% in the prior year period. The increase in adjusted operating \nmargin primarily reflects 7% organic revenue growth and $35 million of net restructuring savings, partially offset by increased operating expenses. R\nisk Capital adjusted operating margin \ndecreased to 26.2% \ncompared to \n27.5% in the prior year period. Human Capital adjusted operating margin increased to 30.5%\n compared to \n25.2% in the prior year period. For the first nine months of 2025, adjusted operating margin was 31.3% compared to 30.8% for the prior year period. The increase primarily reflects 6% organic revenue growth and $110 million of net restructuring savings. \nRisk Capital adjusted operating margin \ndecreased to 34.4% compared to 34.8% in the prior year period. Human Capital adjusted operating margin increased to 28.8% compared to 26.6% in the prior year period.\n•\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,” was $3.05 per share for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $2.72 per share for the prior year period. For the first nine months of 2025, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.22 per share, compared to $11.16 per share for the prior year period.\n•\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Free Cash Flow,” was $1.9 billion in the first nine months of 2025, an increase of $223 million, or 13%, from $1.7 billion in the prior year period, reflecting a $249 million increase in Cash flows from oper\nations, primarily driven by strong adjusted operating income growth and lower NFP-related transaction costs, partially offset by higher payments related to incentive compensation, interest, and restructuring\n, and a $26 million increase in capital expenditures.\nThe current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment is subject to a number of uncertainties, including geopolitical conflicts, tariffs or changes in trade policies, capital markets volatility, and inflation. These and other factors have contributed and may continue to contribute to slower or negative economic growth and may create a challenging business environment for our clients. While we remain confident in the resilience and strength of our business and financial model, due to the global nature of our business, the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

The year-to-date tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical distribution of income and certain discrete items, including the tax benefit associated with the sale of certain assets and liabilities and share-based payments partially offset by the unfavorable impact of other discrete items.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, \nthe quarter-to-date tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical distribution of income and certain discrete items. The year-to-date tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical distribution of income and certain discrete items, including the favorable impacts of share-based payments offset by the unfavorable impact of other discrete items.\nIreland, the U.K., Singapore, and many E.U. member states, among others, have enacted legislation to implement the global minimum tax that is generally consistent with the OECD’s proposed Pillar Two tax regime. There remains significant uncertainty, however, as to how Pillar Two will ultimately apply to the Company. The OECD has issued numerous guidance documents attempting to change how Pillar Two Tax operates, subject to enactment by each implementing country, and the OECD may issue additional guidance in the future. The Company is actively monitoring developments in this area and continues to evaluate the guidance and the potential impacts this may have on its global effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition in 2025 and future periods. \nThe Company continues to analyze the impacts of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act but does not anticipate a material impact on its global effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition in 2025 and future periods.\nNet Income Attributable to Aon Shareholders\nNet income attributable to Aon shareholders for the third quarter of 2025 increased to $458 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, from $343 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Net income attributable to Aon shareholders for the first nine months of 2025 increased to $2.0 billion, or $9.21 per diluted share, from $1.9 billion, or $9.20 per diluted share, in the prior year period. \nNon-GAAP Metrics\nIn our discussion of consolidated results, we sometimes refer to certain non-GAAP supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted net income attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted net income per share, adjusted other income (expense), adjusted effective tax rate, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Management also uses these measures to assess operating performance and performance for compensation. This non-GAAP supplemental information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOrganic Revenue Growth\nWe use supplemental information related to Organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from ongoing operations. Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of certain intercompany \n41\nactivity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions (provided that organic revenue growth includes organic growth of an acquired business as calculated assuming that the acquired business was part of the combined company for the same proportion of the relevant prior year period), divestitures (including held for sale disposal groups, which are adjusted from Organic revenue growth upon classification as held for sale, if any), transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. This supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, Total revenue in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported Total revenue is as follows (in millions, except percentages):\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n% Change\nLess: Currency Impact \n(1)\nLess: Fiduciary Investment Income \n(2)\nLess: Acquisitions, Divestitures & Other \nOrganic Revenue Growth \n(3)\nRisk Capital Revenue:\nCommercial Risk Solutions\n$\n1,988 \n$\n1,852 \n7 \n%\n1 \n%\n— \n%\n(1)\n%\n7 \n%\nReinsurance Solutions\n537 \n503 \n7 \n1 \n(1)\n(1)\n8 \nHuman Capital Revenue:\nHealth Solutions\n935 \n870 \n7 \n1 \n— \n— \n6 \nWealth Solutions\n540 \n499 \n8 \n2 \n— \n1 \n5 \nEliminations\n(3)\n(3)\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nTotal revenue\n$\n3,997 \n$\n3,721 \n7 \n%\n1 \n%\n— \n%\n(1)\n%\n7 \n%\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n% Change\nLess: Currency Impact \n(1)\nLess: Fiduciary Investment Income \n(2)\nLess: Acquisitions, Divestitures & Other \nOrganic Revenue Growth \n(3)\nRisk Capital Revenue:\nCommercial Risk Solutions\n$\n6,168 \n$\n5,675 \n9 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n3 \n%\n6 \n%\nReinsurance Solutions\n2,414 \n2,305 \n5 \n— \n(1)\n1 \n5 \nHuman Capital Revenue:\nHealth Solutions\n2,733 \n2,265 \n21 \n— \n— \n15 \n6 \nWealth Solutions\n1,578 \n1,332 \n18 \n1 \n— \n12 \n5 \nEliminations\n(12)\n(26)\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nTotal revenue\n$\n12,881 \n$\n11,551 \n12 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\n6 \n%\n6 \n%\n(1)\nCurrency impact represents the effect on prior year period results if they were translated at current period foreign exchange rates.\n(2)\nFiduciary investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $75 million and $85 million, respectively.

Aon incurred $10 million and $35 million of integration costs in the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $66 million and $55 million of integration costs in the \nnine months ended September 30, 2025\n and 2024, respectively.\nRisk Capital Adjusted operating income increased $13 million, or 2%, to $661 million in the third quarter of 2025. The increase was primarily due to organic revenue growth of 7% in Commercial Risk Solutions and 8% in Reinsurance Solutions,  partially offset by increased expenses and investments in long-term growth. Human Capital Adjusted operating income increased $105 million, or 30%, to $450 million in the third quarter of 2025. The increase was primarily due to organic revenue growth of 6% in Health Solutions and 5% in Wealth Solutions and decreased expenses, partially offset by investments in long-term growth. For the first nine months of 2025, Risk Capital Adjusted operating income increased $174 million, or 6%, to $3.0 billion. The increase was primarily due to organic revenue growth of 6% in Commercial Risk Solutions, 5% in Reinsurance Solutions, and the impact of NFP, partially offset by increased expenses and investments in long-term growth. Human Capital Adjusted operating income increased $284 million, or 30%, to $1.2 billion for the first nine months of 2025. The increase was \n43\nprimarily due to organic revenue growth of 6% in Health Solutions, 5% in Wealth Solutions, and the impact of NFP, partially offset by increased expenses and investments in long-term growth.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\nWe use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance.

This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, Cash provided by operating activities in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes the supplemental information related to free cash flow is helpful to investors when evaluating our operating performance and liquidity results. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported Cash provided by operating activities is as follows (in millions):\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,084 \n$\n1,835 \nCapital expenditures\n(189)\n(163)\nFree cash flow\n$\n1,895 \n$\n1,672 \nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations\nBecause we conduct business in over 120 countries, foreign exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant impact on our business. Foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided an illustration of the comparable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this comparable impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by hypothetically translating the prior year quarter’s revenue, expenses, and net income using the current quarter’s foreign currency exchange rates.\nCurrency fluctuations had a de minimis impact an\nd an unfavorable impact of $0.12 on net income per diluted share during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, r\nespectively, if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $0.02 and an unfavorable impact of $0.05 on net income per diluted share during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, if 2023 results were translated at 2024 rates.\nCurrency fluctuations ha\nd \na favorable impact of \n$0.02 a\nnd an unfavorable impact of $0.11 on adjusted diluted earnings per share during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $0.02 and an unfavorable impact of $0.05 on adjusted diluted earnings per share during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, if 2023 results were translated at 2024 rates. These translations are performed for comparative and illustrative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION \nLiquidity\nExecutive Summary\nWe believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity in the near-term include cash flows provided by operations, available cash reserves, and divestiture proceeds; primary sources of liquidity in the long-term include cash flows provided by operations, debt capacity available under our credit facilities, and capital markets. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses and investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension obligations, shareholder dividends, and Accelerating Aon United Program cash charges. We believe that cash flows from operations, available credit facilities, available cash reserves, and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including \nprincipal and interest payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and anticipated working capital requirements in the next twelve m\nonths and over the long-term.\nCash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes, as well as amounts restricted as to their use. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums in Fiduciary assets in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities.\nIn our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of \n46\ninsureds, which are then returned to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. The levels of funds held on behalf of clients and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums, claims, and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, and collect funds from clients and make payments on their behalf, and upon the impact of foreign currency movements. Funds held on behalf of clients, because of their nature, are generally invested in highly liquid securities with highly rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. Fiduciary assets include funds held on behalf of clients \nof $8.4 billion and $7.2 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and fiduciary receivables of $10.4 billion and \n$10.3 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. While we earn investment income on the funds held in cash and money market funds, the funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes.\nWe maintain a multi-currency cash pool with a third-party bank in which various Aon entities participate. Individual Aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall global balance does not fall below zero. At September 30, 2025, some Aon entities had negative cash balances; however, the overall balance was positive. Entities with a negative cash pool position incur interest expense, while those with a positive position earn interest income. Interest rates are determined by local market conditions and vary by currency. For the period, if interest expense on negative cash pool balances exceeds interest income associated with positive cash pool balances, as well as other income-producing assets, the net amount is reported as interest expense for both the quarterly and year-to-date periods.\nThe following table summarizes our Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, and Fiduciary assets as of September 30, 2025 (in millions):\n \nStatement of Financial Position Classification\n \nAsset Type\nCash and Cash\nEquivalents\nShort-term\nInvestments\nFiduciary\nAssets\nTotal\nCertificates of deposit, bank deposits, or time deposits\n$\n1,095 \n$\n— \n$\n4,400 \n$\n5,495 \nMoney market funds\n— \n207 \n3,991 \n4,198 \nCash, Short-term investments, and funds held on behalf of clients\n1,095 \n207 \n8,391 \n9,693 \nFiduciary receivables\n— \n— \n10,390 \n10,390 \nTotal\n$\n1,095 \n$\n207 \n$\n18,781 \n$\n20,083 \nCash and cash equivalents and funds held on behalf of clients, including cash and cash equivalents and funds held on behalf of clients classified as held for sale, had a net increase of $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared t\no a net increase of $1.3 billion\n for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. A summary of our cash flows provided by and used for operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows (in millions):\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,084 \n$\n1,835 \nCash used for investing activities\n(362)\n(2,256)\nCash provided by (used for) financing activities\n(1,141)\n1,565 \nEffect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and funds held on behalf of clients\n606 \n177 \nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents and funds held on behalf of clients\n$\n1,187 \n$\n1,321 \nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $2.1 billion, an increase of $249 million compared to $1.8 billion of Cash flows provided by operating activities in the prior year period. This amount represents Net income reported, generally adjusted for gains from sales of businesses, losses from sales of businesses, share-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, amortization and impairments, and other non-cash income and expenses, including pension settlement charges. Adjustments also include changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, collection of receivables, and payments for Accelerating Aon United Program expenses.\nPension Contributions\nPension contributions were $80 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to $43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the remainder of 2025, we expect to contribute approximately $8 million in cash to  our pension plans, including contributions to non-U.S. pension plans, which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates.\n47\nAccelerating Aon United Program Expenses\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we initiated a three-year restructuring program called the Accelerating Aon United Program with the purpose of streamlining our technology infrastructure, optimizing our leadership structure and resource alignment, and reducing the real estate footprint to align to our hybrid working strategy. The Program includes technology-related costs to facilitate streamlining and simplifying operations, headcount reduction costs, and costs associated with asset impairments, including real estate consolidation and technology costs. \nProgram charges are recognized within the Program’s expenses on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and consists of the following cost activities:\n•\nTechnology and other\n – includes costs associated with actions taken to rationalize certain applications and to optimize technology across the Company. These costs may include contract termination fees and other non-capitalizable costs associated with Program initiatives, which include professional service fees.\n•\nWorkforce optimization\n – includes costs associated with headcount reduction and other separation-related costs.\n•\nAsset impairments\n – includes non-cash costs associated with impairment of assets, as they are identified, including ROU lease assets, leasehold improvements, and other capitalized assets no longer providing economic benefit.\nThe changes in the Company’s liabilities for the Program as of September 30, 2025 are as follows (in millions):\nTechnology and other\nWorkforce optimization\nAsset impairments\nTotal\nLiability Balance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n17 \n$\n97 \n$\n— \n$\n114 \nCharges\n138 \n91 \n7 \n236 \nCash payments\n(124)\n(110)\n— \n(234)\nForeign currency translation and other\n— \n5 \n— \n5 \nNon-cash charges\n(7)\n(17)\n(7)\n(31)\nLiability balance as of September 30, 2025\n$\n24 \n$\n66 \n$\n— \n$\n90 \nTotal costs incurred from inception to date\n$\n278 \n$\n391 \n$\n91 \n$\n760 \nThe Program is currently expected to result in cumulative costs of $1.0 billion, consisting of approximately $0.9 billion of cash charges and approximately $0.1 billion of non-cash charges. Over the life of the program, our Risk Capital segment is expected to incur approximately $230 million\n of charges, while our Human Capital segment is expected to incur approximately $60 million of charges, with the remaining charges relating to corporate expenses. \nThe Program is estimated to generate annualized expense savings of approximately $350 million by the end of 2026, largely benefiting Compensation and benefits, Information technology, and Premises on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, total Program costs incurred were $32 million and $236 million, respectively. The Company expects to continue to review the implementation of elements of the Program throughout the course of the Program and, therefore, there may be changes to expected timing, estimates of expected costs and related savings. The Company realized an additional $35 million and $110 million of expense savings in the first three and nine months of 2025, respectively, from Program actions, the majority of which were recognized within Compensation and benefits on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used for investing activities were $362 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $1.9 billion compared to $2.3 billion of Cash flows used for investing activities in the prior year period. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for investing activities are acquisition of businesses, purchases of short-term investments, capital expenditures, and payments for investments. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows provided by investing activities are sales of businesses, including collection of deferred consideration in connection with prior year business divestitures, sales of short-term investments, and proceeds from investments. The gains and losses corresponding to cash flows provided by proceeds from investments and used for payments for investments are primarily recognized in Other income (expense) in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\n48\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments decreased $12 million to $207 million at September 30, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024. The majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, we completed fourteen acquisitions, eight within Risk Capital and six within Human Capital. Cash consideration, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients acquired, was \n$276 million\n, which relates to cash consideration paid in 2025 for current year acquisitions. The majority of cash consideration for the Griffiths & Armour acquisition, completed in the first quarter of 2025, was recognized as a cash outflow in the fourth quarter of 2024. During the first nine months of 2024, we completed sixteen acquisitions, eight within Risk Capital and eight within Human Capital. Cash consideration, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients acquired, was $3.0 billion, which includes $4 million related to acquisitions completed in 2023.\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, we completed three dispositions, one within Risk Capital and two within Human Capital, for an insignificant cash flow impact. During the first nine months of 2024, we completed five dispositions, three within Risk Capital and two within Human Capital, for $602 million, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients. During the first nine months of 2025 and 2024, a $108 million and $84 million gain was recognized, respectively, related to the deferred consideration earned for the 2017 sale of the benefits administration and business process outsourcing b\nusiness. Other than this deferred consideration, there was a $5 million cash flow impact during the first nine months of 2025 related to dispositions that occurred in prior periods. \nCapital Expenditures\nOur additions to fixed assets including capitalized software, amounted to $189 million and $163 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, which primarily relate to new build out and the refurbishing of office facilities, software development costs, and computer equipment purchases. In the current period, we continue to support certain technology projects to drive long-term growth and real estate projects to align with our Smart Working strategy, including projects related to our AAU restructuring program.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows used for financing activities were $1.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of $2.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion of Cash flows provided by financing activities in the prior year period. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flow provided by financing activities are issuances of debt, changes in net fiduciary liabilities, and proceeds from issuance of shares. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for financing activities are repayments of debt, share repurchases, cash paid for employee taxes on withholding shares, dividends paid to shareholders, transactions with noncontrolling interests, and other financing activities, such as payments for deferred consideration in connection with prior year business acquisitions.\nShare Repurchase Program\nWe have a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. The Repurchase Program was established in April 2012 with $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases, and was increased by $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases in each of November 2014, June 2017, and November 2020, and by $7.5 billion in February 2022 for a total of $27.5 billion in repurchase authorizations.\nThe following table summarizes our share repurchase activity (in millions, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nShares repurchased\n0.7 \n0.9 \n2.0 \n2.5 \nAverage price per share\n$\n362.00 \n$\n339.31 \n$\n371.71 \n$\n316.57 \nRepurchase costs recorded to accumulated deficit\n$\n250 \n$\n304 \n$\n750 \n$\n804 \nAt September 30, 2025, the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the Repurchase Program was approximately $1.6 billion. Under the Repurchase Program, the Company has repurchased a total of 174.2 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $25.9 billion. For further information regarding the Repurchase Program, see Part II, Item 2 of this report.\n49\nBorrowings\nTotal debt at September 30, 2025 was $16.8 billion, a decrease of $226 million compared to December 31, 2024. Further, commercial paper activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 is as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nTotal issuances \n(1)\n$\n1,079 \n$\n425 \n$\n4,523 \n$\n1,697 \nTotal repayments\n(1,183)\n(425)\n(4,147)\n(2,288)\nNet issuances (repayments)\n$\n(104)\n$\n— \n$\n376 \n$\n(591)\n(1)\nThe proceeds of the commercial paper issuances are generally used for short-term working capital needs.\nIn May 2025, Aon Global Limited’s €500 million ($585 million at September 30, 2025 exchange rates) 2.875% Senior Notes due May 2026 were classified as Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as the date of maturity is in less than one year. The Company expects to use cash flow from operations and available cash on hand to repay these Senior Notes.\nIn December 2024, Aon Global Limited’s $750 million 3.875% Senior Notes due December 2025 were classified as Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as the date of maturity is in less than one year. The Company expects to use cash flow from operations and available cash on hand to repay these Senior Notes.\nIn June 2024, Aon Global Limited’s $600 million 3.500% Senior Notes matured and were repaid in full.\nOn April 25, 2024, Aon North America, Inc. drew its $2 billion delayed draw term loan and used proceeds, together with the proceeds of the notes issued on March 1, 2024 described below, to pay a portion of cash consideration in connection with the NFP Transaction, to repay certain debt of NFP, and to pay related fees and ex\npenses. The term loan was set to mature on April 24, 2027 and was prepayable at any time. As of September 30, 2025, Aon North America, Inc. repaid $1.6 billion of the outstanding balance and the remaining outstanding balance was $400 million. On October 31, 2025, Aon North America, Inc. repaid the remaining $400 million outstanding balance.\nOn April 2, 2024, Aon plc announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Randolph Acquisition Corp., commenced cash tender offers for any and all of the outstanding 6.875% Senior Notes due 2028, 4.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2028, 7.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2030 and 8.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2031, each issued by NFP Corp. (together, the “NFP Notes”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated as of April 2, 2024. The total amount tendered pursuant to the tender offers was approximately $3.3 billion, excluding premiums. On April 26, 2024, Randolph Acquisition Corp. purchased those NFP Notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to April 15, 2024, effecting the early settlement of the offers (the “Early Settlement”). In addition, on April 16, 2024, NFP Corp. delivered notices of redemption of all NFP Notes not validly tendered pursuant to the offers and purchased at the Early Settlement, at a purchase price equal to the price paid to holders of the NFP Notes in connection with the Early Settlement, with a redemption date of April 26, 2024. As a result of the Early Settlement of the offers and the related redemption which occurred on April 26, 2024, no NFP Notes remain outstanding. \nAon plc incurred $6 million of debt extinguishment charges in the second quarter of 2024 related to costs related to the NFP Transaction. \nOn March 1, 2024, Aon North America, Inc. issued $600 million 5.125% Senior Notes due in Mar\nch 2027, $1 billion 5.150% Senior Notes due in March 2029, $650 million 5.300% Senior Notes due in March 2031, $1.75 billion 5.450% Senior Notes due in March 2034, and $2 billion 5.750% Senior Notes due in March 2054, totaling to an aggregate amount of $6 billion. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including a portion of which was used to pay a portion of the cash consideration in connection with the acquisition of NFP, to repay certain debt of NFP and to pay related fees and expenses.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nDistributable Profits\nWe are required under Irish law to have available “distributable profits” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable profits are created through the earnings of the Irish parent company and, among other methods, through intercompany dividends or a reduction in share capital approved by the High Court of Ireland. Distributable profits are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g., Accumulated deficit). As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had distributable profits in excess of $30.5 billion and $29.7 billion, respectively. We believe that we will have sufficient distributable profits for the foreseeable future.\n50\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nWe expect cash generated by operations for 2025 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations, finance capital expenditures, and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders. Although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities, we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows. Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding: a $1.0 billion multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in September 2027 and a $1.0 billion multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in October 2028. In aggregate, these two facilities provide $2.0 billion in available credit. \nEach of these primary committed credit facilities and the delayed draw term loan includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, in each case, tested quarterly. We\n did not have borrowings under either of these primary committed credit facilities as of \nSeptember 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024. Additionally, we are in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the rolling 12 months ended September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nDisposal Definitive Agreement and Subsequent Event\nOn September 3, 2025, Aon signed a definitive agreement to sell a significant majority of NFP’s wealth business including Wealthspire Advisors, Fiducient Advisors, Newport Private Wealth and related platforms to Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC and this disposition was completed on October 30, 2025 and total proceeds received on closing were $2.3 billion. Upon the completion of the sale in the fourth quarter, the gain will be recognized within Other income (expense) on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n \nShelf Registration Statement\nOn June 22, 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt securities, preference shares, class A ordinary shares and convertible securities. Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions, and other factors.\nRating Agency Ratings\nThe major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at October 31, 2025 appear in the table below. \n \nRatings\n \n \n \nSenior Long-term Debt\n \nCommercial Paper\n \nOutlook\nStandard & Poor’s\nA-\n \nA-2\n \nNegative\nMoody’s Investor Services\nBaa2\n \nP-2\n \nStable\nFitch, Inc.\nBBB+\n \nF-2\n \nStable\nLetters of Credit and Other Guarantees\nWe have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a letter of credit. We had total LOCs outstanding of approximately $125 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $124 million at December 31, 2024. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian\n secure non-qualified pension plan schemes, reinsurance obligations related to our own \nE&O\n liability insurance program, and secure deductible retentions for our own workers’ compensation program. We also have ob\ntained LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries.\nWe have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $143 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $162 million at December 31, 2024.\n51\nGuarantee of Registered Securities\nAll issued and outstanding debt securities by Aon Corporation are guaranteed by Aon Global Limited, Aon plc, Aon North America, Inc., and Aon Global Holdings plc, and include the following (collectively, the “Aon Corporation Notes”): \nAon Corporation Notes\n8.205% Junior Subordinated Notes due January 2027\n4.500% Senior Notes due December 2028\n3.750% Senior Notes due May 2029\n2.800% Senior Notes due May 2030\n6.250% Senior Notes due September 2040\nAll guarantees of Aon plc, Aon Global Limited, Aon North America, Inc., and Aon Global Holdings plc of the Aon Corporation Notes are joint and several as well as full and unconditional.
