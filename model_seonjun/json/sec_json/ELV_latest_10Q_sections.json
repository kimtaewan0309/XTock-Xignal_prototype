References to the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” or “Elevance Health” used throughout this MD&A refer to Elevance Health, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. References to the “states” include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, unless the context otherwise requires.\nResults of operations, cost of care trends, investment yields and other measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results and trends that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025, or any other period. \nOverview\nElevance Health is a health company with the purpose of improving the health of humanity. We are one of the largest health insurers in the United States in terms of medical membership, serving approximately 45.4 million medical members through our affiliated health plans as of September 30, 2025. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (“BCBSA”), an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (“BCBS”) licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (in the New York City metropolitan area and upstate New York), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas, we do business as Anthem Blue Cross and Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. We also conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees, as well as other strategic partners. In addition, we serve members in numerous states as Wellpoint, Carelon, MMM and/or Simply Healthcare. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico through our subsidiaries. Through various subsidiaries, we also offer pharmacy services through our CarelonRx business, and other healthcare related services as Carelon Services.\nOur portfolio consists of the following core go-to-market brands:\n•\nAnthem Blue Cross/Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield — represents our Anthem-branded and affiliated Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensed Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial Health Benefit plans;\n•\nWellpoint — represents our Wellpoint branded Medicare, Medicaid and commercial Health Benefit plans and other non-BCBSA brands; and\n•\nCarelon — represents our healthcare related services and capabilities, including our CarelonRx and Carelon Services businesses. \nWe report our results of operations in the following four reportable segments: Health Benefits, CarelonRx, Carelon Services and Corporate & Other (our businesses that do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment, as well as corporate expenses not allocated to our other reportable segments). For additional information, see Note 15, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \nFor additional information about our organization, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n-38-\nBusiness Trends\nMedical Cost Trends:\n \nOur medical cost trends are primarily driven by changes in the utilization of services across all provider types and the unit cost of these services. We work to mitigate these trends through various medical management programs such as care and condition management, program integrity and specialty pharmacy management and utilization management, as well as benefit design changes. There are many drivers of medical cost trends that can cause variance from our estimates, such as changes in the level and mix of services utilized, regulatory changes, aging of the population, health status and other demographic characteristics of our members, epidemics, pandemics, advances in medical technology, new high-cost prescription drugs, new indications of existing prescription drugs, provider contracting inflation, labor costs and healthcare fraud, waste and abuse.\nMembership shifts from Medicaid into our Individual ACA (as defined below) business following the redetermination process that began in April 2023, together with lower membership effectuation rates, particularly in geographies with high concentrations of highly subsidized members, have driven a market-wide increase in morbidity, resulting in elevated medical cost trends. \nMedicaid cost trends remain elevated due to higher population acuity and increased utilization of services. In response, we are working on program improvements in partnership with the states, strengthening care management, and optimizing our clinical strategy to improve effectiveness and lower costs.\nPricing Trends: \nWe strive to price our health benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical cost trends. We frequently make adjustments to respond to legislative and regulatory changes as well as pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and new market entrants. Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. Pricing of the Medicare and Medicaid programs may not adequately reflect current underlying healthcare cost trends given the timing lag between when pricing is established and the start of the applicable contract, which could adversely affect our financial results. \nIf the approvals of any annual premium rate changes by contracted government agencies are delayed, we are required to defer the recognition of any premium rate increases to the period in which the premium rates become final. The impact of this deferral can be significant in the period in which the increased premium rates are first recognized depending on the magnitude of the premium rate increase, the number of members to which it applies and the length of the delay between the effective date of the rate increase and the final contract date. Premium rate decreases are recognized in the period the change in premium rate becomes effective and the change in the rate is known, which may be prior to the period in which the contract amendment affecting the rate is finalized.\nAffordable Care Act\n: We continue to participate in the Individual state- or federally-facilitated marketplaces (the “Public Exchange”) in nearly all of our Anthem Blue Cross and Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield service areas. We have expanded into select service areas in Florida, Maryland, and Texas in 2025, using our Simply Healthcare and Wellpoint brands. Going forward, we expect the Public Exchange to be influenced by policy and regulatory changes, particularly around federal subsidies, compliance requirements, and market stability.\nCarelonRx: \nCarelonRx markets and offers pharmacy services to our affiliated health plan customers throughout the country and to customers outside of the health plans we own. Our comprehensive pharmacy services portfolio includes all core pharmacy services, such as home delivery and specialty pharmacies, claims adjudication, formulary management, pharmacy networks, rebate administration, a prescription drug database and member services, as well as infusion services and injectable therapies. \nCarelonRx delegates certain core pharmacy services to CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C., which is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”), pursuant to an agreement (the “CVS Agreement”) with the current contractual term extending through December 31, 2027. We can elect to have CVS continue to provide services to us for a three-year extension period on the same terms and conditions as in the current CVS Agreement in the event of a termination or non-renewal by either party.\nFor additional discussion regarding business trends, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n-39-\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties\nThe federal budget reconciliation legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBBA”) was signed into law on July 4, 2025. The OBBBA contains a variety of provisions that could impact our business and operations including: changes to Medicaid renewal and eligibility rules, such as more frequent redeterminations for beneficiaries receiving coverage through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended, (collectively, the “ACA”), and a requirement for certain adults made eligible under the ACA, to meet work or community engagement standards; changes to federal requirements regarding Medicaid state directed payments and provider taxes, including taxes on managed care organizations; delays in the implementation of Medicaid final regulations on certain eligibility and enrollment provisions; application of cost sharing to certain services for adults made eligible under the ACA’s Medicaid expansion; reduction of the allowable home equity asset threshold for members seeking eligibility for Medicaid long term care services; authorization of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to approve certain state home and community-based services waivers; elimination of the repayment limit for excess advanced premium tax credits under the ACA;  modification of the rules regarding Health Savings Account eligible plans under the ACA and a permanent extension of the safe harbor first established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, allowing pre-deductible coverage of telehealth services for HSA eligible high-deductible health plans; and establishment of a new Rural Health Transformation program, among other provisions. Additional federal and state guidance is being issued to implement these OBBBA provisions, most of which have effective dates in 2027 and 2028, although some states may look to implement certain of these provisions in 2026.\nIn addition, in June 2025, \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) \nfinalized the Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Regulation which modifies the ACA exchange open enrollment period beginning in plan year 2027 and eligibility for premium tax credits among other requirements. In September 2025, a federal court delayed the effective dates for several provisions of the Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Regulation pending the resolution of ongoing litigation challenging the legality of those provisions. Also, in September 2025, CMS issued guidance modifying eligibility requirements for ACA catastrophic plans.\nIn September 2024, the HH\nS, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the U.S Department of the Treasury (collectively, the “Tri-Agencies”) issued final regulations related to mental health parity that will require health plans to make administrative and operational changes to comply with these final regulations. While some provisions became effective on January 1, 2025, additional guidance from the Tri-Agencies will be necessary to assess the full impact of these regulations on our operations and financial results. Litigation has been filed by third parties challenging these final regulations.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 decoupled Medicaid eligibility redeterminations from the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency initially declared in January 2020. As a result, states were permitted to begin removing ineligible beneficiaries from their Medicaid programs starting April 1, 2023, and the majority of our Medicaid markets began doing so as of June 30, 2023. Although most states have completed this process, CMS has provided that states have until December 31, 2025 to complete these eligibility redeterminations.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) contains a variety of provisions that have impacted, and continue to impact, our business, including by extending the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021’s enhanced Premium Tax Credits (“PTC”) through 2025; imposing a new corporate alternative minimum tax; providing a one percent excise tax on repurchases of stock; allowing CMS to negotiate prices on a limited set of prescription drugs in Medicare effective in 2026; instituting caps on insulin cost sharing in Medicare; redesigning the Medicare Part D benefit; requiring drug manufacturers to pay rebates if prices increase beyond inflation; and delaying the implementation of the Trump Administration Medicare drug rebate rule until at least 2032. The extension of the enhanced PTC has allowed for growth in Individual Public Exchange enrollment and has supported continuity of coverage since Medicaid eligibility redeterminations resumed in 2023. If Congress does not act to extend the enhanced PTC, they will expire at the end of 2025, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe ACA continues to impact our business and results of operations, including pricing, minimum medical loss ratios, and the geographies in which our products are available. \nWe also expect further and ongoing regulatory guidance on a number of issues related to Medicare, including evolving methodology for ratings and quality bonus payments. CMS also frequently proposes changes to its program that audits data \n-40-\nsubmitted under the risk adjustment programs in ways that could increase financial recoveries from pla\nns. For example, in May 2025, CMS announced plans to substantially increase the scale and pace of Risk Adjustment Data Validation (“RADV”) audits of Medicare Advantage plans, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor additional discussion regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, see Part I, Item 1, “Business – Regulation,” Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and the “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties” section of Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Significant Items\nBusiness and Operational Matters\nPursuant to CMS’ Medicare Advantage Star Ratings system, CMS annually awards between 1.0 and 5.0 Stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance in several categories. Plans must have a Star Rating of 4.0 or higher to qualify for bonus payments. Our 2025 Star Ratings, which are used for payment year 2026, reflect that approximately 40% of our Medicare Advantage members were enrolled in plans rated at least 4.0 Stars or higher. CMS released our 2026 Star Ratings in October 2025, which will be used to determine our Medicare Advantage bonus payments in 2027. Our 2026 Star Ratings reflect that approximately 55% of our Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans rated at least 4.0 Stars or higher.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nInvestments in Joint Ventures and Completed Acquisitions\nOn December 31, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Centers Plan for Healthy Living LLC and Centers for Specialty Care Group IPA, LLC (“Centers”). Centers is a managed long-term care plan that serves New York state Medicaid and dual-eligible Medicaid/Medicare members, enabling adults with long-term care needs and disabilities to live safely and independently in their own home. This acquisition aligns with our strategic plan to grow the Health Benefits segment and leverage industry-leading expertise while serving Medicaid and dual-eligible Medicaid/Medicare populations. Measurement period adjustments during the three months ended September 30, 2025 included a $(39) reduction to goodwill, and a $39 addition to tangible net assets acquired.\nOn August 6, 2024, we made an equity investment of $2,580 that resulted in our minority interest ownership of approximately 35% of Augusta Topco Holdings, L.P. (“Mosaic Health”), a joint venture with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (“CD&R”) that is designed to accelerate innovation in care delivery across multiple regions in the United States by bringing together certain care delivery and enablement assets of Carelon Management Services Inc (“CMSI Assets”), a Carelon Health business, and two CD&R portfolio businesses, apree health and Millennium Physician Group. Our additional contribution of the CMSI Assets to Mosaic Health was completed on January 1, 2025, for which we received an additional $300 of equity (approximately 5% ownership) in Mosaic Health. \nFor additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions”, Note 5, “Investments”, and Note 6, “Derivative Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nLitigation Matters\nWe are a defendant in multiple lawsuits that were initially filed in 2012 against the BCBSA and Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees (the “Blue plans”) across the country. Cases filed in 28 states were consolidated into a single, multi-district proceeding captioned \nIn re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation \n(“BCBSA Litigation”) that is pending before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (the “Court”). Generally, the lawsuits in the BCBSA Litigation challenge elements of the licensing agreements between the BCBSA and the independently owned and operated Blue plans along with other arrangements in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and related state laws. The cases were brought by two nationwide classes of plaintiffs, health plan subscribers and providers.\nThe BCBSA and Blue plans approved a settlement agreement and release with the subscriber plaintiffs (the “Subscriber Settlement Agreement”), and the ultimate amount paid by the Company under the Subscriber Settlement Agreement was \n-41-\n$604, which was primarily accrued in 2020. The Subscriber Settlement Agreement and the defendants’ payment and non-monetary obligations under the Subscriber Settlement Agreement became effective in June 2024 with the request for the second Blue plan bid provision effective in September 2024. The funds held in escrow will be distributed in accordance with the Subscriber Settlement Agreement.\nThe BCBSA and the Blue plans approved a settlement agreement and release (the “Provider Settlement Agreement”) with the provider plaintiffs, and in October 2024, the provider plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval with the Court. The Court granted preliminary approval of the Provider Settlement Agreement on December 4, 2024\n. A Final Fairness Hearing was held in July 202\n5, and the Court issued a Final Approval Order for the Provider Settlement Agreement in August 2025. The Provider Settlement Agreement requires the defendants to make a monetary settlement payment no later than September 18, 2025. Our portion of the monetary settlement payment of $666 has been paid. The Provider Settlement Agreement also requires that certain non-monetary terms including (i) expansion of certain opportunities to contract with providers in contiguous service areas, (ii) certain prompt pay commitments, and (iii) various technological enhancements to the BlueCard program, be implemented on a timeline set forth in the Provider Settlement Agreement. We recognized our payment obligation under the Provider Settlement Agreement of $666 in September 2024. A number of follow-on cases involving entities that opted out of the putative Provider Settlement Agreement have been filed. \nFor additional information regarding the BCBSA Litigation, see Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies – \nLitigation and Regulatory Proceedings – Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation\n,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nSelected Operating Performance\nFor the twelve months ended September 30, 2025, total medical membership declined by 0.9%. This was primarily driven by decreases in our BlueCard\n®\n business and attrition in Medicaid membership, primarily as a result of eligibility redeterminations. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our Medicare Advantage business. \nOperating revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $50,087, an increase of $5,368, or 12.0%, from the three months ended September 30, 2024. Operating revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $148,273, an increase of $18,058, or 13.9%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increases for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 were primarily a result of premium rate increases in our Health Benefits segment in recognition of medical cost trends, recent acquisitions, and growth in our Medicare Advantage business, partially offset by Medicaid membership attrition.                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nNet income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $1,187, an increase of $179, or 17.8%, from the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $5,115, a decrease of $443, or 8.0%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to decreased losses on financial instruments and decreased income tax expense. The increase was partially offset by higher amortization of other intangible assets and higher interest expense. The decrease in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to decreased operating gain within our Health Benefits segment and increased net losses on financial instruments. The decrease was partially offset by increases in operating gain in our CarelonRx and Carelon Services businesses and decreased income tax expense. \n Our fully-diluted shareholders’ earnings per share (“EPS”) was $5.32 for the three months ended September 30, 2025, which represented a 22.0% increase from EPS of $4.36 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our EPS was $22.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, which represented a 4.8% decrease from EPS of $23.81 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2025  resulted primarily from increased shareholders' net income and the impact of fewer diluted shares outstanding. The decrease in EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 resulted primarily from decreased shareholders' net income, partially offset by the impact of fewer diluted shares outstanding.\nOperating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was $4,206 and $5,102, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the Provider Settlement Agreement payment made in September 2025 and lower net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\n-42-\nMembership and Other Metrics\nThe following table presents our medical membership by customer type as of September 30, 2025 and 2024. Also included below is other membership by product and other metrics. The membership data and other metrics presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period. The CarelonRx Quarterly Adjusted Scripts metric represents adjusted script volume based on the number of days a prescription covers. On an adjusted basis, one 90-day script counts the same as three 30-day scripts. The Carelon Services Consumers Served metric represents the number of consumers receiving one or more healthcare-related services from Carelon Services who are members of our affiliated health plans as well as those who are members of non-affiliated health plans. For a more detailed description of our medical membership, see the “Membership” section of Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeptember 30\n \n \n2025\n2024\nChange\n% Change\nMedical Membership \n(in thousands)\nIndividual\n1,354 \n1,299 \n55 \n4.2 \n%\nEmployer Group Risk-Based\n3,616 \n3,672 \n(56)\n(1.5)\n%\nCommercial Risk-Based\n4,970 \n4,971 \n(1)\n— \n%\nBlueCard\n®\n6,394 \n6,677 \n(283)\n(4.2)\n%\nEmployer Group Fee-Based\n20,608 \n20,589 \n19 \n0.1 \n%\nCommercial Fee-Based\n27,002 \n27,266 \n(264)\n(1.0)\n%\nMedicare Advantage\n2,245 \n2,047 \n198 \n9.7 \n%\nMedicare Supplement\n877 \n894 \n(17)\n(1.9)\n%\nTotal Medicare\n3,122 \n2,941 \n181 \n6.2 \n%\nMedicaid\n8,645 \n8,926 \n(281)\n(3.1)\n%\nFederal Employee Program\n®\n1,630 \n1,656 \n(26)\n(1.6)\n%\nTotal Medical Membership\n45,369 \n45,760 \n(391)\n(0.9)\n%\nOther Membership\n (in thousands)\nDental Members\n7,364 \n7,021 \n343 \n4.9 \n%\nDental Administration Members\n1,957 \n1,878 \n79 \n4.2 \n%\nVision Members\n10,842 \n10,382 \n460 \n4.4 \n%\nMedicare Part D Standalone Members\n217 \n258 \n(41)\n(15.9)\n%\nOther Metrics \n(in millions)\nCarelonRx Quarterly Adjusted Scripts\n85.0 \n80.2 \n4.8 \n6.0 \n%\nCarelon Services Consumers Served\n97.6 \n101.3 \n(3.7)\n(3.7)\n%\nMedical Membership\nThe decrease in medical membership was primarily driven by decreases in our BlueCard\n®\n business and attrition in Medicaid membership, including as a result of eligibility redeterminations. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our Medicare Advantage business.\nOther Membership\nOur other membership has the potential to be impacted by changes in our medical membership, as our medical members often purchase our other products that are ancillary to our health business. Dental membership increased primarily due to favorable sales in our Employer Group business. Dental administration membership increased primarily due to favorable in-\n-43-\ngroup change with other BCBSA plans associated with FEP\n®\n.

We also calculate operating gain and operating margin to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results and comparing them among periods. We define operating revenue as premium income, product revenue and service fees. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net losses on financial instruments, loss/gain on sale of business, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets or income taxes, as these items are managed in our corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Operating margin is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, forecasting future operating periods and setting incentive compensation targets. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, shareholders’ net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For a reconciliation of reportable segments’ operating revenue to the amounts of total revenue included in the consolidated statements of income and a reconciliation of income before income tax expense to reportable segments’ operating gain, see Note 15, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe report our results of operations in the following four reportable segments: Health Benefits, CarelonRx, Carelon Services and Corporate & Other (our businesses that do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment, as well as corporate expenses not allocated to our other reportable segments). For additional information, see Note 15, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \n-46-\nThe following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024:\n \nNine Months Ended \n September 30\nThree Months Ended \n September 30\nThree Months Ended \nSeptember 30\nNine Months Ended \nSeptember 30\n \n2025 vs. 2024 Change\n2025 vs. 2024 Change\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n$\n%\n$\n%\nOperating Revenue\nHealth Benefits\n$\n42,246\n$\n38,278\n$\n125,259\n$\n112,695\n$\n3,968 \n10.4 \n%\n$\n12,564 \n11.1 \n%\nCarelonRx\n10,997\n9,143\n31,756\n25,984\n1,854 \n20.3 \n%\n5,772 \n22.2 \n%\nCarelon Services\n7,324\n4,638\n21,301\n13,192\n2,686 \n57.9 \n%\n8,109 \n61.5 \n%\nCorporate & Other\n149\n74\n546\n323\n75 \n101.4 \n%\n223 \n69.0 \n%\nEliminations \n(10,629)\n(7,414)\n(30,589)\n(21,979)\n(3,215)\n43.4 \n%\n(8,610)\n39.2 \n%\nTotal operating revenue\n$\n50,087\n$\n44,719\n$\n148,273\n$\n130,215\n$\n5,368 \n12.0 \n%\n$\n18,058 \n13.9 \n%\nOperating Gain (Loss)\nHealth Benefits\n$\n601\n$\n1,604\n$\n4,378\n$\n6,036\n$\n(1,003)\n(62.5)\n%\n$\n(1,658)\n(27.5)\n%\nCarelonRx\n556\n619\n1,694\n1,639\n(63)\n(10.2)\n%\n55 \n3.4 \n%\nCarelon Services\n219\n184\n1,110\n682\n35 \n19.0 \n%\n428 \n62.8 \n%\nCorporate & Other\n(81)\n(999)\n(292)\n(1,168)\n918 \n(91.9)\n%\n876 \n(75.0)\n%\nTotal operating gain\n$\n1,295\n$\n1,408\n$\n6,890\n$\n7,189\n$\n(113)\n(8.0)\n%\n$\n(299)\n(4.2)\n%\nOperating Margin\nHealth Benefits\n1.4 \n%\n4.2 \n%\n3.5 \n%\n5.4 \n%\n(280) bp\n(190) bp\nCarelonRx\n5.1 \n%\n6.8 \n%\n5.3 \n%\n6.3 \n%\n(170) bp\n(100) bp\nCarelon Services\n3.0 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n5.2 \n%\n5.2 \n%\n(100) bp\n0 bp\nTotal operating margin\n2.6 \n%\n3.1 \n%\n4.6 \n%\n5.5 \n%\n(50) bp\n(90) bp\nbp = basis point;

Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, goodwill and other intangible assets and investments. Our accounting policies related to these items are discussed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, as well as in the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section of Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” As of September 30, 2025, our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed from those described in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Estimates can require a significant amount of judgment, and a different set of assumptions could result in material changes to our reported results.\nMedical Claims Payable\nThe most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. Our accounting policies related to medical claims payable are discussed in the references cited above. As of September 30, 2025, our critical accounting policies and estimates related to medical claims payable have not changed from those described in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, see Note 9, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe following table provides a summary of the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid liability estimates for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, which are the trend and completion factors. These two key assumptions can be influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations.\nFavorable Developments by \nChanges in Key Assumptions\nNine Months Ended \n September 30\n2025\n2024\nAssumed trend factors\n$\n1,035 \n$\n664 \nAssumed completion factors\n231 \n946 \nTotal\n$\n1,266 \n$\n1,610 \n-49-\nThe favorable development recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 resulted from trend factors in late 2024 developing more favorably than originally expected as well as a smaller contribution from faster than expected development of completion factors from the latter part of 2024. The favorable development recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from favorable development in the completion factors resulting from the latter part of 2023 developing faster than expected as well as trend factors in late 2023 developing more favorably than originally expected.\nThe ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 86.3% and 85.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. This ratio serves as an indicator of claims processing speed whereby speed for claims payments was slightly faster during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWe calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net medical claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current period in order to demonstrate the development of prior year reserves. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, this metric was 8.9%, which was mainly driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2024, with favorable completion factor development from 2024 also contributing. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this metric was 11.3%, driven by both favorable completion factor development from 2023 and favorable trend factor development at the end of 2023.\nWe calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, this metric was 1.0%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $1,266. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the comparable metric was 1.3%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $1,610. We believe these metrics demonstrate an appropriate and consistent level of reserve conservatism.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Capital\nOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, product revenue, service fees, investment income, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from business divestitures, proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, operating expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.\nFor a more detailed overview of our liquidity and capital resources management, see the “\nIntroduction\n” section included in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor additional information regarding our sources and uses of capital during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, see Note 5, “Investments,” Note 6, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” Note 10, “Debt,” and Note 12, “Capital Stock – \nUse of Capital – Dividends and Stock Repurchase Program,\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n-50-\nLiquidity\nA summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 is as follows:\n \nNine Months Ended \n September 30\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\nSources of Cash:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n4,206 \n$\n5,102 \n$\n(896)\nProceeds from the sale of subsidiaries, net of cash sold\n— \n399 \n(399)\nPurchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired\n55 \n— \n55 \nIssuances of short- and long-term debt, net of repayments\n659 \n1,915 \n(1,256)\nChanges in securities lending payable\n576 \n158 \n418 \nProceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans\n21 \n205 \n(184)\nChanges in bank overdrafts\n77 \n— \n77 \nTotal sources of cash\n5,594 \n7,779 \n(2,185)\nUses of Cash:\nPurchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions\n(412)\n(1,614)\n1,202 \nPurchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired\n— \n(1,124)\n1,124 \nRepurchase and retirement of common stock\n(2,134)\n(1,089)\n(1,045)\nPurchases of property and equipment\n(823)\n(934)\n111 \nCash dividends\n(1,152)\n(1,135)\n(17)\nChanges in securities lending collateral\n(576)\n(160)\n(416)\nChanges in bank overdrafts\n— \n(172)\n172 \nOther uses of cash, net\n(73)\n(193)\n120 \nTotal uses of cash\n(5,170)\n(6,421)\n1,251 \nEffect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n1 \n2 \n(1)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n425 \n$\n1,360 \n$\n(935)\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the Provider Settlement Agreement payment made in September 2025 and lower net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nOther significant sources of cash year-over-year included decreased purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales, maturities, calls, and redemptions, lower amounts for purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, changes in bank overdrafts and decreased purchases of property and equipment. Other significant uses of cash year-over-year included a decrease in issuance of short- and long-term debt, net of repayments and increased amounts for the repurchase and retirement of common stock.\nWe maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities of $37,327 at September 30, 2025. Since December 31, 2024, total cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $1,611, primarily due to lower amounts for purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, changes in bank overdrafts and decreased purchases of property and equipment. This increase was partially offset by decreased cash generated by issuances of short- and long-term debt, net of repayments, increased amounts for the repurchase and retirement of common stock and decreased cash generated from operations.\nMany of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, could impact our subsidiaries’ future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain \n-51-\nundertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.\nAt September 30, 2025, we held $2,647 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments.\nPeriodically, we access capital markets and issue debt (“Notes”) for long-term borrowing purposes, for example, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. Certain of these Notes may have a call feature that allows us to redeem the Notes at any time at our option and/or a put feature that allows a Note holder to redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating. For more information on our debt, including redemptions and issuances, see Note 10, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. \nWe calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, from the amounts presented on our consolidated balance sheets included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total equity. Total debt is the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, less current portion. We believe our debt-to-capital ratio assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital r\natio was 42.1% and \n43.0% as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. \nOur senior debt is rated “A” by S&P Global Ratings, “BBB+” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs.\nCapital Resources\nWe have a shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries, the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansions.\nWe have a senior revolving credit facility (the “5-Year Facility”) with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. On September 5, 2025, we amended and restated the credit agreement for the 5-Year Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the 5-Year Facility from April 2027 to September 2030 and increase the amount of credit available under the 5-Year Facility from $4,000 to $5,000. Our ability to borrow under the 5-Year Facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt-to-capital ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the amended and restated credit agreement for the 5-Year Facility. As of September 30, 2025, our debt-to-capital ratio, as defined and calculated under the 5-Year Facility, was 42.1%. We do not believe the restrictions contained in our 5-Year Facility covenants materially affect our financial or operating flexibility. As of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants under the 5-Year Facility. \nWe have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $4,000, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. Should commercial paper issuance become unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our 5-Year Facility to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. We had no commercial paper outstanding at either September 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024.\nWe are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (collectively, the “FHLBs”). As a member, we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. We had $180 and $365 of outstanding short-term borrowings from the FHLBs as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\n-52-\nWe regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nFor additional information regarding our sources and uses of capital at September 30, 2025, see Note 5, “Investments,” Note 6, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” Note 10, “Debt,” and Note 12, “Capital Stock \n–\n \nUse of Capital – Dividends and Stock Repurchase Program,\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn addition to regulations regarding the timing and amount of dividends, our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for health and other insurance companies and health maintenance organizations largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) Risk-Based Capital for Health Organizations Model Act (the “RBC Model Act”). These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset, insurance, interest rate and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries’ respective RBC levels as of December 31, 2024, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all applicable mandatory RBC requirements. In addition to exceeding these RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries. For additional information, see Note 22, “Statutory Information,” in our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 included in Part II, Item 8 of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFuture Sources and Uses of Liquidity\nWe believe that cash on hand, future operating cash receipts, investments and funds available under our commercial paper program, our 5-Year Facility and borrowings available from the FHLBs will be adequate to fund our expected cash disbursements over the next twelve months.\nThere have been no material changes to our long-term liquidity requirements as disclosed in Part II, Item 7 of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional updates regarding our estimated long-term liquidity requirements, see Note 6, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” Note 10, “Debt,” and the “\nOther Contingencies\n” and “\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n” sections of Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our 5-Year Facility and/or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions. \n-53-\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \nThis document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
