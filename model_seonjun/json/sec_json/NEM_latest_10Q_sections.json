Please refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below, for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this MD&A by the Company. \nThis item should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this quarterly report. Additionally, the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on February 21, 2025.\nOverview\nNewmont is the world’s leading gold company and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index and the Fortune 500 list of companies. We have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World since 2007 and have adopted the World Gold Council’s Conflict-Free Gold Policy. In September 2025, Newmont continued to be the top mining company in TIME's listing of the world's most sustainable companies. Since 2015, Newmont has been ranked as one of the mining and metal sector's top gold miners by the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. Newmont was ranked the top miner in 3BL Media’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens list which ranks the 1,000 largest publicly traded U.S. companies on ESG transparency and performance. We are primarily engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold properties, some of which may contain copper, silver, lead, zinc or other metals. We have significant operations and/or assets in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Ecuador, and Ghana. Our goal is to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining.\nRefer to the Consolidated Financial Results, Results of Consolidated Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources and non-GAAP Financial Measures for information about the continued impacts from inflationary pressures, effects of certain countermeasures taken by central banks, and supply chain disruptions, with particular consideration on the outlook for increased costs specific to labor, materials, consumables and fuel and energy on operations, as well as impacts on the timing and cost of capital expenditures and the risk of potential impairment to certain assets. Refer to discussion of Risk and Uncertainties within Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nDivestiture of Non-Core Assets\nBased on a comprehensive review of the Company’s portfolio of assets following the Newcrest acquisition, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a portfolio optimization program to divest six non-core assets and a development project in February 2024. The non-core assets to be divested included CC&V, Musselwhite, Porcupine, Éléonore, Telfer, Akyem, and the Coffee development project in Canada and were presented as held for sale in the first quarter of 2024.\nThe Company completed the sale of the assets of the Telfer reportable segment in the fourth quarter of 2024, the sale of the CC&V, Musselwhite, and Éléonore reportable segments in the first quarter of 2025, and the sale of the Porcupine and Akyem reportable segments in the second quarter of 2025. In the third quarter of 2025, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Coffee development project, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2025 and remained designated as held for sale at September 30, 2025.\nAssets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell and are periodically valued until sale occurs with any resulting gain or loss recognized in \n(Gain) loss on sale of assets held for sale\n. Additionally, gains or losses recognized on the completion of the sale are recognized in \n(Gain) loss on sale of assets held for sale\n.\nAs a result, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 a gain of $99 was recognized within \n(Gain) loss on sale of assets held for sale, \nprimarily resulting from a partial reversal of a prior period write-down on assets held for sale. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, a gain of $1,074 was recognized within \n(Gain) loss on sale of assets held for sale, \nrespectively,\n \nprimarily resulting from the completed sales. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a loss of $115 and $846 was recognized within \n(Gain) loss on sale of assets held for sale, \nrespectively,\n \nprimarily consisting of write-downs on assets held for sale.\nRefer to Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on divestitures.\n40\n \nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Financial Results\nThe details of our \nNet income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders\n are set forth below:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders \n$\n1,832 \n$\n873 \n$\n959 \n$\n5,784 \n$\n1,877 \n$\n3,907 \nNet income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders per common share, diluted\n$\n1.67 \n$\n0.76 \n$\n0.91 \n$\n5.20 \n$\n1.63 \n$\n3.57 \nThe increase in \nNet income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders\n for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, is primarily due to (i) a net increase in \nSales\n largely due to higher average realized gold prices partially offset by the impact from divestitures, (ii) a net reduction in \nCosts applicable to sales\n largely due to the impact of divestitures, and (iii) a gain on the partial reversal of a prior period write-down on assets held for sale, compared to prior year write-downs of assets held for sale, recognized in \n(Gain) loss on sale of assets held for sale\n.

The decrease during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, is primarily due to lower labor costs and lower consulting charges.\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest \nwas $52 and $86 during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $196 and $282 during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, is primarily due to the reduction in \nDebt,\n which was driven by a $2 billion debt tender for the partial redemption of certain senior notes, the full redemption of the outstanding 2026 Senior Notes, and the partial redemption of certain other senior notes, and an increase in capitalized interest. Refer to Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIncome and mining tax expense (benefit)\n was $787 and $244 during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $2,526 and $695 during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate is driven by a number of factors and the comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods will be primarily affected by (i) \n44\n \nTable of Contents\nvariations in our income before income taxes; (ii) geographic distribution of that income; (iii) impacts of the changes in tax law; (iv) valuation allowances on tax assets; (v) percentage depletion; (vi) fluctuation in the value of the USD and foreign currencies; and (vii) the impact of specific transactions and assessments. As a result, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, year to year. This trend is expected to continue in future periods.

Gold equivalent ounces are calculated as pounds or ounces produced or sold multiplied by the ratio of the other metals’ price to the gold price, using the metal prices in the table below:\nGold\nCopper\nSilver\nLead\nZinc\n(ounce)\n(pound)\n(ounce)\n(pound)\n(pound)\n2025 GEO Price\n (1)\n$\n1,700 \n$\n3.50 \n$\n20.00 \n$\n0.90 \n$\n1.20 \n2024 GEO Price\n$\n1,400 \n$\n3.50 \n$\n20.00 \n$\n1.00 \n$\n1.20 \n____________________________\n(1)\nEffective January 1, 2025, GEO pricing was updated to align with reserve metal price assumptions as outlined above (\"GEO price change\"). The update to GEO pricing will have an impact on the calculated gold equivalent ounces. This will result in an impact to costs allocated to the respective GEOs, particularly resulting in higher costs allocated to gold.\n46\n \nTable of Contents\nGold or Other Metals Produced\nCosts Applicable to Sales\n (1)\nDepreciation and Amortization\nAll-In Sustaining Costs\n (2)\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nGold\n(ounces in thousands)\n($ per ounce sold)\n($ per ounce sold)\n($ per ounce sold)\nAhafo\n145 \n213 \n$\n1,309 \n$\n867 \n$\n304 \n$\n249 \n$\n1,541 \n$\n1,043 \nBrucejack\n79 \n89 \n$\n1,184 \n$\n970 \n$\n687 \n$\n689 \n$\n1,763 \n$\n1,197 \nRed Chris\n15 \n9 \n$\n1,492 \n$\n2,228 \n$\n430 \n$\n723 \n$\n2,037 \n$\n2,633 \nPeñasquito\n88 \n63 \n$\n956 \n$\n985 \n$\n370 \n$\n396 \n$\n1,133 \n$\n1,224 \nMerian\n47 \n58 \n$\n1,722 \n$\n1,795 \n$\n382 \n$\n374 \n$\n2,255 \n$\n2,153 \nCerro Negro\n68 \n60 \n$\n1,375 \n$\n1,535 \n$\n557 \n$\n532 \n$\n1,776 \n$\n1,878 \nYanacocha\n152 \n93 \n$\n769 \n$\n1,072 \n$\n193 \n$\n255 \n$\n868 \n$\n1,285 \nBoddington\n146 \n137 \n$\n1,268 \n$\n1,098 \n$\n242 \n$\n203 \n$\n1,524 \n$\n1,398 \nTanami\n100 \n102 \n$\n1,158 \n$\n979 \n$\n324 \n$\n299 \n$\n1,748 \n$\n1,334 \nCadia\n97 \n115 \n$\n820 \n$\n723 \n$\n306 \n$\n271 \n$\n1,188 \n$\n1,078 \nLihir\n129 \n129 \n$\n1,468 \n$\n1,619 \n$\n360 \n$\n292 \n$\n1,810 \n$\n1,883 \nNGM\n251 \n242 \n$\n1,241 \n$\n1,311 \n$\n450 \n$\n420 \n$\n1,502 \n$\n1,675 \nDivested\n (3)\nCC&V\n— \n38 \n$\n— \n$\n1,416 \n$\n— \n$\n85 \n$\n— \n$\n1,712 \nMusselwhite\n— \n52 \n$\n— \n$\n993 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n1,574 \nPorcupine\n— \n67 \n$\n— \n$\n1,114 \n$\n— \n$\n31 \n$\n— \n$\n1,451 \nÉléonore\n— \n54 \n$\n— \n$\n1,344 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n1,924 \nTelfer \n(4)\n— \n6 \n$\n— \n N.M. \n$\n— \n N.M. \n$\n— \n N.M. \nAkyem\n— \n47 \n$\n— \n$\n2,051 \n$\n— \n$\n214 \n$\n— \n$\n2,230 \nTotal/Weighted-Average\n (5)\n1,317 \n1,574 \n$\n1,185 \n$\n1,207 \n$\n383 \n$\n308 \n$\n1,566 \n$\n1,611 \nMerian (25%)\n(12)\n(15)\nAttributable to Newmont\n1,305 \n1,559 \nGold equivalent ounces - other metals\n(ounces in thousands)\n($ per ounce sold)\n($ per ounce sold)\n($ per ounce sold)\nRed Chris\n (6)\n29 \n32 \n$\n1,514 \n$\n2,231 \n$\n437 \n$\n724 \n$\n2,007 \n$\n2,714 \nPeñasquito\n (7)\n209 \n229 \n$\n1,074 \n$\n990 \n$\n400 \n$\n382 \n$\n1,289 \n$\n1,286 \nBoddington\n (8)\n25 \n48 \n$\n1,112 \n$\n1,017 \n$\n217 \n$\n197 \n$\n1,319 \n$\n1,168 \nCadia\n (9)\n96 \n120 \n$\n779 \n$\n685 \n$\n310 \n$\n272 \n$\n1,143 \n$\n880 \nDivested\n (3)\nTelfer\n (4)(10)\n— \n1 \n$\n— \n N.M. \n$\n— \n N.M. \n$\n— \n N.M. \nTotal/Weighted-Average\n (5)\n359 \n430 \n$\n1,045 \n$\n1,015 \n$\n370 \n$\n358 \n$\n1,370 \n$\n1,338 \nCopper\n(tonnes in thousands)\nRed Chris\n (6)\n7 \n6 \nBoddington\n (8)\n6 \n9 \nCadia\n (9)\n22 \n21 \nDivested\n (3)\nTelfer\n (10)\n— \n1 \nTotal/Weighted-Average\n35 \n37 \nLead\n(tonnes in thousands)\nPeñasquito\n (7)\n26 \n19 \nZinc\n(tonnes in thousands)\nPeñasquito\n (7)\n59 \n58 \nAttributable gold from equity method investments\n (11)\n(ounces in thousands)\nPueblo Viejo (40%)\n72 \n66 \nFruta del Norte (32%)\n44 \n43 \nAttributable to Newmont\n116 \n109 \n____________________________\n(1)\nExcludes \nDepreciation and amortization\n and \nReclamation and remediation\n. \n(2)\nAll-in sustaining costs is a non-GAAP financial measure.

The unrealized changes in fair value for the fixed forward contracts are recorded in \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n and are reclassified to earnings through\n Costs applicable to sales\n. Refer to Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our hedging instruments.\nHyperinflationary Economies\nHyperinflationary economies are defined by the International Monetary Fund (\"IMF\") as economies in which the projected three-year cumulative inflation exceeds 100%. At September 30, 2025, hyperinflationary economies in which the Company held operations included Ghana, Argentina, and Suriname.\nGhana.\n Our Ahafo mine is located in Ghana and is a USD functional currency entity. In 2021, the Bank of Ghana created a voluntary gold purchase program in the effort to stabilize the local currency and build up gold reserves through domestic gold purchases conducted in local currency at prevailing market rates. The majority of Ahafo's activity has historically been denominated in USD; as a result, the devaluation of the Ghanaian cedi has resulted in an immaterial impact on our financial statements. Therefore, future devaluation of the Ghanaian cedi is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nArgentina.\n Our Cerro Negro mine is located in Argentina and is a USD functional currency entity. Beginning in 2020, Argentina’s central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency, including requiring the Company to convert USD proceeds from metal sales to local currency within 60 days from shipment date or 20 business days from receipt of cash, whichever happens first, as well as restricting payments to foreign-related entities denominated in foreign currency, such as dividends or distributions to the parent and related companies and royalties and other payments to foreign beneficiaries. These restrictions directly impact Cerro Negro's ability to repay intercompany debt to the Company. In the third quarter of 2024, certain restrictions were lifted or modified, allowing companies to repay intercompany debt in certain circumstances. \nIn April 2025, the IMF Executive Board approved a 48-month, $20 billion extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility for Argentina. Within the program objectives, the IMF expressly mentions transitioning toward exchange rate flexibility, while gradually lifting foreign currency restrictions. The new exchange rate regime allows the Argentine peso to float within a moving band of 1,000 to 1,400 pesos per USD, expanding by 1% monthly at both limits. The central bank can intervene if the band is breached and may operate in secondary peso markets within the band. This managed float led to an immediate devaluation of the Argentine Peso. Further, a series of foreign currency restrictions have been lifted, including allowing companies to transfer to their foreign shareholders profits and dividends corresponding to fiscal years that began on or after January 1, 2025, provided applicable requirements are met.\nWe continue to monitor the foreign currency exposure risk and the evolution of currency controls, which are currently not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\n54\n \nTable of Contents\nSuriname.\n Our Merian mine is located in Suriname and is a USD functional currency entity. In 2021, the Central Bank took steps to stabilize the local currency, while the government introduced new legislation to narrow the gap between government revenues and spending. The measures to increase government revenue mainly consist of tax increases; however, Newmont and the Republic of Suriname have a Mineral Agreement in place that supersedes such measures. The Central Bank of Suriname adopted a controlled floating rate system, which resulted in a concurrent devaluation of the Surinamese dollar. The majority of Merian’s activity has historically been denominated in USD; as a result, the devaluation of the Surinamese dollar has resulted in an immaterial impact on our financial statements. Therefore, future devaluation of the Surinamese dollar is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity Overview\nWe have a disciplined capital allocation strategy of maintaining financial flexibility to execute our capital priorities and generate long-term value for our stockholders. Consistent with that strategy, we aim to self-fund development projects and make strategic partnerships focused on profitable growth, while reducing our debt and returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nThe Company continues to experience the impacts from geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures. With the resulting volatile environment, we continue to monitor inflationary conditions, the effects of certain countermeasures taken by central banks, and the potential for further supply chain disruptions, as well as an uncertain and evolving labor market and trade environment including tariff and regulatory changes. Depending on the duration and extent of the impact of these events, or changes in commodity prices, the prices for gold and other metals, and foreign exchange rates, we could continue to experience volatility; transportation industry disruptions could occur, including limitations on shipping produced metals; our supply chain could continue to experience disruption; cost inflation rates could further increase; or we could incur credit related losses of certain financial assets, which could materially impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we believe our available liquidity allows us to manage the short- and, possibly, long-term material adverse impacts of these events on our business. Refer to Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on risks and uncertainties.\nAt September 30, 2025, the Company had $5,639 of \nCash and cash equivalents.\n The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in a variety of highly liquid and low-risk investments with original maturities of three months or less that are available to fund our operations as necessary. We may have investments in prime money market funds that are classified as cash and cash equivalents; however, we continually monitor the need for reclassification under the SEC requirements for money market funds, and the potential that the shares of such funds could have a net asset value of less than their par value. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund our operations and corporate activities.\nAt September 30, 2025, $1,761 of \nCash and cash equivalents \nwas held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily held in USD-denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to USD. \nCash and cash equivalents \ndenominated in Argentine peso are subject to regulatory restrictions. Refer to Foreign Currency Exchange Rates above for further information. At September 30, 2025, $1,493 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. We expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with any potential withholding taxes.\nWe believe our existing consolidated \nCash and cash equivalents\n, available capacity on our revolving credit facility, and cash generated from continuing operations will be adequate to satisfy working capital needs, fund future growth, meet debt obligations and meet other liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. At September 30, 2025, our borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility was $4,000 and we had no borrowings outstanding. We continue to remain compliant with covenants and do not currently anticipate any events or circumstances that would impact our ability to access funds available on this facility.

The declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the full discretion of the Board and will depend on the Company’s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\nIn February 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of outstanding common stock to provide returns to stockholders, provided that the aggregate value of shares of common stock repurchased under the new program does not exceed $1 billion; this program has been completed. In October 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $2 billion stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of outstanding common stock; this program has been completed. In July 2025, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $3 billion stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of outstanding common stock.\nThe program will be executed at the Company’s discretion, permits shares to be repurchased under a variety of methods, has no expiration date, may be discontinued at any time, and the program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares of its common stock or to repurchase the full authorized amount. Consequently, the Board of Directors may revise or terminate such share repurchase authorization in the future. Through the date of filing, we have executed and settled total trades of common stock repurchases under the previously authorized programs of $3,300, of which $1,875 was repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCapital Expenditures\nCash generated from operations is used to execute our capital priorities, which include sustaining and developing our global portfolio of long-lived assets. Our near-term development capital projects include Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, and the Cadia Panel Caves. These projects are being funded from existing liquidity and will continue to be funded from future operating cash flows. \nWe consider sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. Capital expenditures to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations, where these projects will enhance production or reserves, are considered non-sustaining or development capital. The Company’s decision to reprioritize, sell or abandon a development project, which may include returning mining concessions to host governments, could result in a future impairment charge.\nFor additional information on our capital expenditures, refer to Part II, Item 7, Liquidity and Capital Resources of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on February 21, 2025.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we had \nAdditions to property, plant and mine development\n, inclusive of capitalized interest, as follows:\n2025\n2024\nDevelopment Projects\nSustaining Capital\nTotal\nDevelopment Projects\nSustaining Capital\nTotal\nAhafo\n$\n269 \n$\n100 \n$\n369 \n$\n201 \n$\n72 \n$\n273 \nBrucejack\n— \n77 \n77 \n2 \n50 \n52 \nRed Chris\n71 \n46 \n117 \n76 \n49 \n125 \nPeñasquito\n— \n82 \n82 \n— \n90 \n90 \nMerian\n— \n42 \n42 \n— \n64 \n64 \nCerro Negro \n35 \n79 \n114 \n90 \n45 \n135 \nYanacocha\n8 \n7 \n15 \n39 \n15 \n54 \nBoddington\n— \n102 \n102 \n— \n91 \n91 \nTanami\n270 \n122 \n392 \n229 \n69 \n298 \nCadia\n213 \n199 \n412 \n187 \n213 \n400 \nLihir\n3 \n114 \n117 \n62 \n77 \n139 \nNGM\n104 \n186 \n290 \n69 \n278 \n347 \nCorporate and Other\n— \n10 \n10 \n— \n15 \n15 \nDivested\n (1)\nCC&V\n— \n5 \n5 \n— \n20 \n20 \nMusselwhite \n— \n14 \n14 \n— \n74 \n74 \nPorcupine \n28 \n26 \n54 \n97 \n62 \n159 \nÉléonore \n— \n12 \n12 \n— \n77 \n77 \nTelfer\n— \n— \n— \n12 \n27 \n39 \nAkyem\n— \n9 \n9 \n1 \n19 \n20 \nAccrual basis\n$\n1,001 \n$\n1,232 \n2,233 \n$\n1,065 \n$\n1,407 \n2,472 \nDecrease (increase) in non-cash adjustments\n(6)\n55 \nCash basis \n$\n2,227 \n$\n2,527 \n____________________________\n(1)\nRefer to Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, development projects primarily included Ahafo North, Tanami Expansion 2, Cadia Panel Caves, Red Chris Block Caves, Cerro Negro expansion projects, and the Goldrush Complex at NGM.

As a result of these redemptions, the company recognized a loss on extinguishment of $72 and $100 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, recognized in \nOther income (loss), net\n.\nDebt Covenants. \nRefer to Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on February 21, 2025, for information regarding our debt covenants. At September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all existing debt covenants and provisions related to potential defaults.\nRefer to Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nCo-Issuer and Supplemental Guarantor Information. \nThe Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as amended, which enables us to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, depository shares, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, warrants and units (the “Shelf Registration Statement”). Under the Shelf Registration Statement, our debt securities may be guaranteed by Newmont USA Limited (“Newmont USA”), one of our consolidated subsidiaries.\nNewmont and Newcrest Finance Pty Ltd (\"Newcrest Finance\"), as issuers, and Newmont USA, as guarantor, are collectively referred to here-within as the \"Obligor Group.\"\nThese guarantees are full and unconditional, and none of our other subsidiaries guarantee any security issued and outstanding. The cash provided by operations of the Obligor Group, and all of its subsidiaries, is available to satisfy debt repayments as they become due, and there are no material restrictions on the ability of the Obligor Group to obtain funds from subsidiaries, by dividend, loan, or otherwise, except to the extent of any rights of noncontrolling interests or regulatory restrictions limiting repatriation of cash. Net assets attributable to noncontrolling interests were $185 and $181 at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. All noncontrolling interests relate to non-guarantor subsidiaries. \nNewmont and Newmont USA are primarily holding companies with no material operations, sources of income or assets other than equity interest in their subsidiaries and intercompany receivables or payables. Newcrest Finance is a finance subsidiary with no material assets or operations other than those related to issued external debt. Newmont USA’s primary investments are comprised of its 38.5% interest in NGM. For further information regarding these and our other operations, refer to Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Results of Consolidated Operations within Part I, Item 2, MD&A.\nIn addition to equity interests in subsidiaries, the Obligor Group’s balance sheets consisted primarily of the following intercompany assets, intercompany liabilities, and external debt. The remaining assets and liabilities of the Obligor Group are considered immaterial at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nAt September 30, 2025\nAt December 31, 2024\nObligor Group\nNewmont USA\nObligor Group\nNewmont USA\nCurrent intercompany assets\n$\n22,389 \n$\n15,265 \n$\n19,387 \n$\n12,147 \nNon-current intercompany assets\n$\n915 \n$\n440 \n$\n531 \n$\n470 \nCurrent intercompany liabilities\n$\n28,088 \n$\n1,505 \n$\n19,964 \n$\n1,564 \nCurrent external debt\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n924 \n$\n— \nNon-current intercompany liabilities\n$\n250 \n$\n— \n$\n540 \n$\n— \nNon-current external debt\n$\n5,173 \n$\n— \n$\n7,546 \n$\n— \nNewmont USA's subsidiary guarantees (the “subsidiary guarantees”) are general unsecured senior obligations of Newmont USA and rank equal in right of payment to all of Newmont USA's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of Newmont USA's future subordinated indebtedness. The subsidiary guarantees are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of Newmont USA to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.\n58\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2025, Newmont USA had guaranteed $5,116 of the $5,173 in total Obligor Group external debt. Under the terms of the subsidiary guarantees, holders of Newmont’s securities subject to such subsidiary guarantees will not be required to exercise their remedies against Newmont before they proceed directly against Newmont USA.\nNewmont USA will be released and relieved from all its obligations under the subsidiary guarantees in certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following:\n•\nupon the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of a majority of the total voting power of the capital stock or other interests of Newmont USA (other than to Newmont or any of Newmont’s affiliates);\n•\nupon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of Newmont USA (other than to Newmont or any of Newmont’s affiliates); or\n•\nupon such time as Newmont USA ceases to guarantee more than $75 aggregate principal amount of Newmont’s debt (at September 30, 2025, Newmont USA guaranteed $600 aggregate principal amount of debt of Newmont that did not contain a similar fall-away provision).\nNewmont’s debt securities are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of Newmont to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities of Newmont’s non-guarantor subsidiaries. At September 30, 2025, (i) Newmont’s total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $5,651, none of which was secured (other than $471 of \nLease and other financing obligations\n), and (ii) Newmont’s non-guarantor subsidiaries had $7,324 of total liabilities (including trade payables, but excluding intercompany and external debt and reclamation and remediation liabilities), which would have been structurally senior to Newmont’s debt securities.\nFor further information on our debt, refer to Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2025, there have been no material changes, outside the ordinary course of business, in our contractual obligations since December 31, 2024.
