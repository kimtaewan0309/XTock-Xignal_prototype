All rights reserved. \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025 and Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, before deciding to purchase, hold, or sell shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and digital twin applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nRevenue growth in the third quarter was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions. Our Blackwell architectures are the majority of our Data Center revenue.\nThe availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of these resources could impact our future revenue and financial performance. Expanding energy capacity to meet demand is a complex, multi-year process that involves significant regulatory, technical, and construction challenges. In addition, access to capital can be particularly constrained for less-capitalized companies, which may face difficulties securing financing for large-scale infrastructure projects. These limitations could delay customer deployments or reduce the scale of accelerated computing and AI adoption.\nWe continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We began shipping production units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms including GB300 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and continue to sell prior generation architecture. The complexity of our product transitions and sophisticated system configurations may cause delays in production or create challenges in managing supply and demand. This could result in revenue volatility, quality issues, increased inventory provisions, and/or increased warranty costs. Customers may postpone purchasing new architectures or may adopt new technologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses. \n25\nIn April 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that a license is required for exports of our H20 product into the China market. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the demand for H20 diminished. In August 2025, the USG granted licenses that would allow us to ship certain H20 products to certain China-based customers, but to date, we have generated approximately $50 million in H20 revenue under those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% or more of the revenue generated from licensed sales of our products, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement.\nIn January 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” Interim Final Rule, or IFR, in the Federal Register. The IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on our most recent data center products, such as our H200, GB200 and GB300. In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. For example, in October 2025, the Senate passed the “GAIN AI Act” in the National Defense Authorization Act, or the NDAA. The GAIN AI Act would restrict the Trump Administration’s ability to adapt the Biden Administration’s export control rules and could also allow private U.S. persons to review and overturn licensing and foreign policy decisions made by the Trump Administration.\nThe recent rise in high-quality open-source foundation models is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is dependent on developer adoption and if deployed on our competitors’ platforms, it could reduce demand for our products and services. \nThe rapid evolution of global trade policies, such as export controls and tariffs, has added complexity and increased costs throughout our supply chain, and these challenges are likely to persist. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions by us and our partners, disrupt supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and demand.\nWe are increasing our U.S.-based manufacturing and investing in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected to strengthen our supply chain, add resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.\nMacroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.\nRefer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nThird Quarter of Fiscal Year 2026 Summary\nThree Months Ended\nQuarter-over-Quarter Change\nYear-over-Year Change\n \nOct 26, 2025\nJul 27, 2025\nOct 27, 2024\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nRevenue\n$\n57,006 \n$\n46,743 \n$\n35,082 \n22 \n%\n62 \n%\nGross margin\n73.4 \n%\n72.4 \n%\n74.6 \n%\n1.0 \n pts\n(1.2)\n pts\nOperating expenses\n$\n5,839 \n$\n5,413 \n$\n4,287 \n8 \n%\n36 \n%\nOperating income\n$\n36,010 \n$\n28,440 \n$\n21,869 \n27 \n%\n65 \n%\nNet income\n$\n31,910 \n$\n26,422 \n$\n19,309 \n21 \n%\n65 \n%\nNet income per diluted share\n$\n1.30 \n$\n1.08 \n$\n0.78 \n20 \n%\n67 \n%\nRevenue was $57.0 billion, up 62% from a year ago and up 22% sequentially.\nData Center revenue was $51.2 billion, up 66% from a year ago and up 25% sequentially, driven by three platform shifts –accelerated computing, powerful AI models, and agentic applications. Blackwell Ultra is now our leading architecture across all customer categories while our prior Blackwell architecture saw continued strong demand. H20 sales were insignificant in the third quarter of fiscal year 2026.\nData Center compute revenue was $43.0 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 27% sequentially. Networking revenue was $8.2 billion, up 162% from a year ago from the introduction and continued growth of NVLink compute fabric for \n26\nGB200 and GB300 systems. Networking revenue was up 13% sequentially, driven by the growth of XDR InfiniBand products, NVLink, and Ethernet for AI solutions, while shipment timing and supply availability varied compared to the prior quarter. \nGaming revenue was up 30% from a year ago on the continued demand for Blackwell. Gaming revenue was down 1% sequentially as channel inventories have reached more normalized levels heading into the holiday season.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 56% from a year ago and up 26% sequentially, driven by the launch of our new DGX Spark as well as the growth of Blackwell sales.\nAutomotive revenue was up 32% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially, driven by continued adoption of our self-driving platforms.\nGross margin decreased from a year ago as our business model transitioned from offering Hopper HGX systems to Blackwell full-scale datacenter solutions. Gross margin increased sequentially as Blackwell ramped with an improved mix and cost structure.\nOperating expenses were up 36% from a year ago and up 8% sequentially. The increases were primarily driven by compute and infrastructure costs, higher compensation and benefits due to compensation increases and employee growth and engineering development costs for new product introductions.\nFinancial Information by Business Segment and Geographic Data\nRefer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure regarding segment information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nRefer to Part II, Item 7, \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.

Revenue from Data Center computing grew 59% year-on-year compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, driven by demand for our Blackwell computing platform. Revenue from Data Center networking grew 105% year-on-year compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 driven by the introduction and continued growth of NVLink compute fabric for GB200 and GB300 systems, the growth of XDR InfiniBand products, and adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions.\nGraphics revenue\n – The year over year increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026 was driven by sales of our Blackwell architecture.\nReportable segment operating income\n – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income in the third quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by growth in revenue. The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income in the first nine months of fiscal year 2026 was driven by the growth in revenue, partially offset by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. The year over year increase in Graphics segment operating income in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026 was driven by the growth in revenue.\nConcentration of Revenue\nWe refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, CSPs, hyperscale companies, and system integrators. Certain direct customers may use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete their build. We refer to indirect customers as those who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs, Neocloud builders, hyperscale, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.\nDirect Customers\n – For the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, four direct customers with sales greater than 10% of total revenue included: Customer A at 22%, Customer B at 15%, Customer C at 13%, and Customer D at 11%, which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2026, sales to two direct customers represented 21% and 13% of total revenue, respectively, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. The customers referenced above may represent different customers than those reported in a previous period.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, sales to three direct customers each represented 12% of total revenue, which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, sales to three direct customers represented 12%, 11%, and 11% of total revenue, which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nIndirect Customers\n – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Indirect customers primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distributors.\n28\nWe generate a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of indirect customers, some individually representing 10% or more of our revenue. Certain companies purchase cloud and related services through various direct and indirect customers. We estimate that one AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our revenue purchasing cloud services from our customers in the third quarter of fiscal year 2026. Our revenue is concentrated among a limited number of direct, indirect and cloud service purchasers and this trend may continue.\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the location of the customers' headquarters of direct customers even if the estimated revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers headquartered outside of the United States accounted for 31% and 34% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026, respectively, and 44% and 41% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025, respectively.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nGross margins decreased to 73.4% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 74.6% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, and 69.3% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2026 compared to 75.8% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, as our business model transitioned from offering Hopper HGX systems to Blackwell full-scale datacenter solutions. Gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal year 2026 was also impacted by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $410 million and $6.7 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026, respectively, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $366 million and $1.3 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.1% and 3.7% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026, respectively.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $865 million and $2.2 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $106 million and $305 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.2% and 2.0% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\n \nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nOct 26, 2025\nOct 27, 2024\n$\nChange\n%\nChange\nOct 26, 2025\nOct 27, 2024\n$\nChange\n%\nChange\n \n($ in millions)\nResearch and development expenses\n$\n4,705 \n$\n3,390 \n$\n1,315 \n39 \n%\n$\n12,985 \n$\n9,200 \n$\n3,785 \n41 \n%\nSales, general and administrative expenses\n1,134 \n897 \n237 \n26 \n%\n3,297 \n2,516 \n781 \n31 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n5,839 \n$\n4,287 \n$\n1,552 \n36 \n%\n$\n16,282 \n$\n11,716 \n$\n4,566 \n39 \n%\nThe increases in research and development expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026 were primarily driven by a 27% and 30% increase in compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases, and an 83% and 75% increase in compute and infrastructure, respectively.\nThe increases in sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026 were primarily driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.\n29\nTotal Other Income, Net\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n \nOct 26, 2025\nOct 27, 2024\n$\nChange\nOct 26, 2025\nOct 27, 2024\n$\nChange\n \n($ in millions)\nInterest income\n$\n624 \n$\n472 \n$\n152 \n$\n1,732 \n$\n1,275 \n$\n457 \nInterest expense\n(61)\n(61)\n— \n(186)\n(186)\n— \nOther income, net\n1,363 \n36 \n1,327 \n3,418 \n301 \n3,117 \nTotal other income, net\n$\n1,926 \n$\n447 \n$\n1,479 \n$\n4,964 \n$\n1,390 \n$\n3,574 \nThe increase in interest income for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026 was primarily due to growth in cash, cash equivalents, and debt securities.\nInterest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. \nOther income, net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-marketable equity securities, publicly-held equity securities, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in Other income, net, compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025, was primarily driven by unrealized gains in our publicly-held equity securities and non-marketable equity securities. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our investments in non-marketable equity securities and publicly-held equity securities.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $6.0 billion and $3.0 billion for the third quarter, and $13.9 billion and $8.0 billion for the first nine months, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 15.9% and 13.5% for the third quarter, and 15.3% and 13.6% for the first nine months, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.\nThe effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and U.S. federal research tax credit relative to the increase in income before income tax. \nOur effective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from foreign-derived deduction eligible income, stock-based compensation, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit.\nIn July 2025, the OBBBA was enacted into law and contains several changes to key U.S. federal income tax laws. We have recognized the tax effects of currently effective OBBBA provisions, which are not material and are reflected in our results for the first nine months of fiscal year 2026. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these legislative changes as tax authorities provide additional guidance and interpretation.\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our assessment of all available information.\nRefer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nOct 26, 2025\nJan 26, 2025\n \n(In millions)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n11,486 \n$\n8,589 \nMarketable securities\n49,122 \n34,621 \nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n$\n60,608 \n$\n43,210 \n30\n \nNine Months Ended\nOct 26, 2025\nOct 27, 2024\n \n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n66,530 \n$\n47,460 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(21,367)\n$\n(13,223)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(42,266)\n$\n(32,410)\nOur investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.\nCash provided by operating activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 due to higher revenue.\nCash used in investing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, primarily driven by higher purchases of non-marketable equity securities and higher purchases of property and equipment.\nCash used in financing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, mainly due to higher share repurchases.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated by our operations. As of October 26, 2025, we had $60.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, including our future obligations. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\nOur marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the USG and its agencies, highly-rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly-rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\nExcept for approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. at the end of the first nine months of fiscal year 2026 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Our tax payments in fiscal year 2026 will decrease due to currently effective OBBBA provisions.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nWe repurchased 70 million and 262 million shares of our common stock for $12.6 billion and $36.7 billion during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026, respectively. On August 26, 2025, our Board of Directors approved an additional $60.0 billion in share repurchase authorization, without expiration.  As of October 26, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $62.2 billion of our common stock.  \nFrom October 27, 2025 through November 14, 2025, we repurchased 6 million shares for $1.1 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan.
