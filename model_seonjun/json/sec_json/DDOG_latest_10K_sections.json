Business\nOverview\nDatadog is the observability and security platform for cloud applications.\nOur SaaS platform integrates and automates infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, log management, user experience monitoring, cloud security, and many other capabilities to provide unified, real-time observability and security for our customers’ entire technology stack. Datadog is used by organizations of all sizes and across a wide range of industries to enable digital transformation and cloud migration, drive collaboration among development, operations, security and business teams, accelerate time to market for applications, reduce time to problem resolution, secure applications and infrastructure, understand user behavior, and track key business metrics.\nSoftware applications are transforming how organizations engage with customers and operate their businesses. Companies across all industries are re-platforming their businesses to cloud native or hybrid on-premise and cloud infrastructures to enable this digital transformation. Historically, engineering teams have been siloed, making the development of next generation applications in dynamic cloud environments challenging. We started Datadog to break this model and facilitate collaboration among development and operations teams, enabling the adoption of DevOps practices. Since then, we have continuously pushed to unify separate tools into an integrated monitoring and analytics platform, readily available to everyone who cares about applications and their impact on business. And while we continue to broaden our capabilities in observability, we have expanded our platform into use cases beyond observability, including cloud security, software delivery, and cloud service management.\nWith our founding goal of breaking down silos between Dev and Ops, we set out in 2010 to build a real-time data integration platform to turn chaos of having uncorrelated data from disparate sources into digestible and actionable insights. Since launching our first use case with Infrastructure Monitoring in 2012, we have expanded our platform rapidly, and today, we offer end-to-end monitoring and analytics, powered by a common data model that is extensible for use cases across observability, security, software delivery, and service management. In 2024, we launched Event Management to aggregate and consolidate alerts to accelerate remediation, and LLM Observability to help customers investigate how they can safely deploy and manage their models in production.\nOur proprietary platform combines the power of metrics, traces, logs, user sessions, security signals, and other data from a single agent and over 850 integrations to provide a unified view of infrastructure, application performance and the real-time events impacting performance. Datadog is designed to be cloud agnostic and easy to deploy, with hundreds of out-of-the-box integrations, a built-in understanding of modern technology stacks, and extensive customizations. Customers can deploy our platform across their entire infrastructure, making it ubiquitous and a daily part of the lives of developers, operations engineers, security professionals, and business leaders.\nWe believe that our platform currently addresses a significant portion of the IT Operations Management market. According to Gartner, the IT Operations Management market represents a $81 billion opportunity in 2028. We believe a large portion of this spend is for legacy on-premise and private cloud environments but does not fully include the opportunity in modern multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments. Our platform is designed to address both legacy and modern environments.\nWe employ a land-and-expand business model centered around offering products that are easy to adopt and have a very short time to value. Our customers can expand their footprint with us on a self-service basis. Our customers often significantly increase their usage of the products they initially buy from us and expand their usage to other products we offer on our platform. We grow with our customers as they expand their workloads in the public and private cloud.\nOur Solution and Key Strengths\nDatadog was founded on the premise that the old model of siloed developers and IT operations engineers is broken, and that legacy tools used for monitoring static on-premise architectures do not work in modern cloud or hybrid environments. Datadog’s cloud-native platform enables development and operations teams to collaborate, quickly build and improve applications, and drive business performance. Empowered by our out-of-the box functionality and simple, self-service installation, our customers are able to rapidly deploy our platform to provide application- and infrastructure-wide visibility, often within minutes.\n5\n•\nBuilt for dynamic cloud and hybrid infrastructures\n. Our innovative platform was born in the cloud and was built to work with ephemeral cloud technologies such as microservices, containers and serverless computing. Our data model was built to work at cloud scale with highly dynamic data sets and processes trillions of events per hour.\n•\nSimple but not simplistic\n. Our platform is easy-to-use with out-of-the-box integrations, customizable drag-and-drop dashboards, real-time visualization and prioritized alerting. The platform is deployed in a self-service installation process within minutes, allowing new users to quickly derive value without any specialized training or heavy implementation or customization. It is highly extensible across a wide array of use cases to a broad set of developers, operations engineers, security professionals, product managers, product designers, platform engineers, customer support staff, and business users. As a result, our platform is integral to business operations and used every day, and our users find increasing value in the solution over time.\n•\nIntegrated data platform\n. We were the first to combine the “three pillars of observability” - metrics, traces, and logs - into a single end-to-end platform with the introduction of our log management solution in 2018. Today, our platform combines infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, log management, user experience monitoring, security monitoring, cloud service management, and developer-focused monitoring in one integrated data platform. This approach increases efficiency by reducing both the expense and friction of attempting to glean insights from disparate systems. We are able to provide a unified view across the IT stack, including infrastructure and application performance, as well as the real-time events impacting performance. Each of our products is integrated and, taken together, they provide the ability to view metrics, traces, logs, sessions, security signals, and other data side-by-side and to perform correlation analysis.\n•\nBuilt for collaboration\n. Our platform was built to break down the silos between developers and operations teams in order to help organizations adopt DevOps practices and improve overall business performance. We provide development and operations teams with a common set of tools to develop a joint understanding of application performance and shared insights into the infrastructure supporting the applications. Additionally, our customizable and interactive dashboards can be shared with business teams to provide them with real-time actionable insights. Over time, as the use cases for our platform have expanded, the types of users that we can serve and help to collaborate have expanded as well, to include security professionals, product managers, product designers, platform engineers, customer support staff, and business users.\n•\nCloud agnostic\n. Our platform is designed to be deployable across all environments, including public cloud, private cloud, on-premise, multi-cloud, and hybrid environments, allowing organizations to diversify their infrastructure and reduce single vendor dependence.\n•\nUbiquitous\n. Datadog is frequently deployed across a customer’s entire infrastructure, making it ubiquitous. Compared to legacy systems that are often used only by a few users in an organization’s IT operations team, Datadog is a daily part of the lives of developers, operations engineers and business leaders.\n•\nIntegrates with our customers’ complex environments\n. We enable development and operations teams to harness the full spectrum of SaaS and open source tools. We have over 850 out-of-the-box integrations with technologies to provide significant value to our customers without the need for professional services. Our integrations provide for comprehensive data point aggregation and consistent, up-to-date, high-quality customer experiences across heterogeneous IT environments as they are fully maintained by Datadog.\n•\nPowered by robust machine-learning and artificial intelligence\n. Our platform ingests massive amounts of data into our unified data warehouse. We develop actionable insights using our advanced analytics capabilities. Our platform's Watchdog capabilities feature artificial intelligence and machine learning that can cross-correlate metrics, traces, logs, sessions, security signals, and other data to identify outliers and notify users of potential anomalies; discover and help resolve issues quickly with automated root cause analysis; augment the troubleshooting workflow with contextual insights; and minimize impact on customers.\n•\nScalable\n. Our SaaS platform is delivered through the cloud. Our platform is massively scalable, currently monitoring trillions of events per hour and millions of servers and containers at any point in time. We offer secure, easily accessible data retention at full granularity for extensive periods of time, which can provide customers with a complete view of their historical data.\n6\nKey Benefits to Our Customers\nOrganizations of all sizes, in all industries, both private and public, purchase our products for a variety of use cases.

Research and development employees are located primarily in our New York and Paris offices, as well as remotely distributed.\nOur research and development team consists of our software engineering, product management, development and site reliability engineering teams. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 3,100 employees in our research and development organization. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our platform and products.\nOur Competition\nThe worldwide monitoring and analytics market is and has been highly competitive for decades and is rapidly evolving. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:\n•\nability to provide unified, real-time observability of IT environments;\n•\nability to operate in dynamic and elastic environments;\n•\nextensibility across the enterprise, including development, operations and business users;\n•\npropensity to enable collaboration between development, operations and business users;\n•\nability to monitor any combination of public clouds, private clouds, on-premise and multi-cloud hybrids;\n•\nability to provide advanced analytics and machine learning;\n•\nease of deployment, implementation and use;\n•\nbreadth of offering and key technology integrations;\n•\nperformance, security, scalability and reliability;\n•\nquality of service and customer satisfaction;\n•\ntotal cost of ownership; and\n•\nbrand recognition and reputation.\nOur unified platform combines functionality from numerous traditional product categories, and hence we compete in each of these categories with different vendors:\n•\nwith respect to on-premise infrastructure monitoring, we compete with diversified technology companies and systems management vendors including IBM, Microsoft Corporation, and SolarWinds Corporation.\n•\nwith respect to APM, we compete with Cisco Systems, Inc., New Relic, Inc. and Dynatrace Software Inc.\n•\nwith respect to Log Management, we compete with Cisco Systems, Inc., and Elastic N.V.\n•\nwith respect to Cloud monitoring, we compete with native solutions from cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, or AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, or GCP.\nAdditionally, we compete with home-grown and open-source technologies across the categories described above. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to the factors listed above. However, many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks, more diverse product and services offerings and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our offerings. Furthermore, we expect that our industry will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets.\n11\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 6,500 employees operating across 33 countries. Approximately 41% of our full-time employees as of that date were located outside of the United States, 35% of whom were located in France. In countries in which we operate, such as France, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements, which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. \nIntellectual Property\nIntellectual property rights are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual protections, to protect our intellectual property, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how and brand. We use open source software in our services. Our API libraries and agent used by customers to send data to our proprietary platform are licensed by us on an open source basis.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we own forty-two patents globally, nine patent applications pending for examination in the United States, three pending PCT applications, and four pending foreign patent applications. The pending U.S. patent applications, if issued, would be scheduled to expire between 2039 and 2043. Despite our pending patent applications, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents. As of December 31, 2024, we own nine registered trademarks in the United States and one hundred twenty-four registered trademarks in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. However, as we have expanded internationally, we have been unable to register or obtain the exclusive right to use the Datadog trademark in certain jurisdictions, and as we continue to expand may face similar issues in other jurisdictions.\nAlthough we rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new services, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our proprietary platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.\nWe control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and we control and monitor access to our software, internal documentation, proprietary technology and other confidential information. Our policy is to require all employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, processes and other intellectual property generated by them on our behalf and under which they agree to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and partners.

Our customers often significantly increase their usage of the products they initially buy from us and expand their usage to other products we offer on our platform. We grow with our customers as they expand their workloads in the public and private cloud.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $1,247.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,942.1 million in marketable securities. We have grown rapidly in recent periods, with revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 of $2,684.3 million, $2,128.4 million, and $1,675.1 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 26% from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and 27% from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Substantially all of our revenue is from subscription software sales. We have continued to make significant expenditures and investments, including in personnel-related costs, sales and marketing, infrastructure and operations, and have incurred net income (losses) of $183.7 million, $48.6 million and $(50.2) million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our operating cash flow was $870.6 million, $660.0 million and $418.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our free cash flow was $775.1 million, $597.5 million and $353.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See the section titled “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow” below.\nUnfavorable conditions in the economy both in the United States and abroad may negatively affect the growth of our business and our results of operations. For example, macroeconomic events including fluctuating inflation and interest rates, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the conflicts in the Middle East have led to economic uncertainty. Historically, during periods of economic uncertainty and downturns, businesses may slow spending on information technology, which may impact our business and our customers’ businesses.\nDue to our subscription model, the effect of macroeconomic conditions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. However, if economic uncertainty increases or the global economy worsens, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed. For further discussion of the potential impacts of macroeconomic events on our business, financial condition, and operating results, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn December 2024, we completed a private offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes. The total proceeds from the 2029 Notes offering were approximately $979.1 million, net of $20.9 million of debt issuance costs.\nWe used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering (i) to pay the $100.9 million cost of the privately negotiated capped call transactions relating to the 2029 Notes, or the Capped Calls and (ii) to repurchase for $196.8 million in privately negotiated transactions approximately $112.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest.\nRefer to Note 8, \nConvertible Senior Notes\n, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe believe there is substantial opportunity to continue to grow our customer base. We intend to drive new customer acquisition by continuing to invest significantly in sales and marketing to engage our prospective customers, increase brand awareness and drive adoption of our platform and products. We also plan to continue to invest in building brand \n45\nawareness within the development and operations communities. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 30,000 customers spanning organizations of a broad range of sizes and industries, compared to approximately 27,300 as of December 31, 2023. Our ability to attract new customers will depend on a number of factors, including the effectiveness and pricing of our products, offerings of our competitors, and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nWe define the number of customers as the number of accounts with a unique account identifier for which we have an active subscription in the period indicated. Users of our free trials or tier are not included in our customer count. A single organization with multiple divisions, segments or subsidiaries is generally counted as a single customer. However, in some cases where they have separate billing terms, we may count separate divisions, segments or subsidiaries as multiple customers.\nExpanding Within Our Existing Customer Base\nOur base of customers represents a significant opportunity for further sales expansion. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 3,610 customers with annual run-rate revenue, or ARR, of $100,000 or more, representing 88% of our ARR, up from 3,190 as of December 31, 2023, representing 86% of our ARR. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 462 customers with annual run-rate revenue, or ARR, of $1.0 million or more, up from 396 as of December 31, 2023. We monitor our number of customers with ARR of $100,000 or more, and believe it is useful to investors, as an indicator of our ability to grow the number of customers that are exceeding this ARR threshold. We define ARR as the annual run-rate revenue of subscription agreements from all customers at a point in time. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly run-rate revenue, or MRR, and multiplying it by 12. MRR for each month is calculated by aggregating, for all customers during that month, monthly revenue from committed contractual amounts, additional usage, usage from subscriptions for a committed contractual amount of usage that is delivered as u\nsed \nand monthly subscriptions. ARR and MRR should be viewed independently of revenue, and do not represent our revenue under GAAP on a monthly or annualized basis, as they are operating metrics that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. ARR and MRR are not intended to be replacements or forecasts of revenue.\nA further indication of the propensity of our customer relationships to expand over time is our dollar-based net retention rate, which compares our ARR from the same set of customers in one period, relative to the year-ago period. As of December 31, 2024, our trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate was high-110%'s. As of December 31, 2023, our trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate was mid-110%'s. The increase in our trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate was attributable to increased usage growth from existing customers. We calculate dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all customers as of 12 months prior to such period-end, or the Prior Period ARR. We then calculate the ARR from these same customers as of the current period-end, or the Current Period ARR. Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months, but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the point-in-time dollar-based net retention rate. We then calculate the weighted average of the trailing 12-month point-in-time dollar-based net retention rates, to arrive at the trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate.\nWe believe that our land-and-expand business model allows us to efficiently increase revenue from our existing customer base. Our customers often expand the deployment of our platform across large teams and more broadly within the enterprise as they migrate more workloads to the cloud, find new use cases for our platform, and generally realize the benefits of our platform. We intend to continue to invest in enhancing awareness of our brand and developing more products, features and functionality, which we believe are important factors to achieve widespread adoption of our platform. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our solution, competition, pricing and overall changes in our customers’ spending levels.\nSustaining Innovation and Technology Leadership\nOur success is dependent on our ability to sustain innovation and technology leadership in order to maintain our competitive advantage. We believe that we have built a highly differentiated platform that will position us to further extend the adoption of our platform and products. Datadog is frequently deployed across a customer’s entire infrastructure, making it ubiquitous. Datadog is a daily part of the lives of developers, operations engineers and business leaders. We employ a land-and-expand business model centered around offering products that are easy to adopt and have a very short time to value. Our efficient go-to-market model enables us to prioritize significant investment in innovation. We have demonstrated the success of our platform approach, through expansion beyond our initial infrastructure monitoring solution to include over 20 products. As of each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 83% of our customers were using more than one product. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, approximately 50% of our customers were using more than four products, up from approximately 47% a year earlier, and approximately 26% of our customers were using more than six products, up from approximately 22% a year earlier. We believe these metrics indicate strong expansion of product adoption across our platform.\n46\nWe intend to continue to invest in building additional products, features and functionality that expand our capabilities and facilitate the extension of our platform to new use cases. We also intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and investments in businesses and technologies to drive product and market expansion. Our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop, market and sell existing and new products to both new and existing customers.\nExpanding Internationally\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to expand usage of our platform outside of North America. Revenue, as determined based on the billing address of our customers, from regions outside of North America was approximately 30% of our total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. In addition, we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments to expand geographically, particularly in EMEA and APAC. Although these investments may adversely affect our operating results in the near term, we believe that they will contribute to our long-term growth. Beyond North America, we now have sales presence internationally, primarily in Amsterdam, Dublin, London, Paris, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to customers using our cloud-based platform. The terms of our subscription agreements are primarily monthly, annual or multi-year, with the majority of our revenue coming from annual subscriptions. Our customers can enter into a subscription for a committed contractual amount of usage that is apportioned ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the subscription period, a subscription for a committed contractual amount of usage that is delivered as used, or a monthly subscription based on usage. To the extent that our customers’ usage exceeds the committed contracted amounts under their subscriptions, either on a monthly basis in the case of a ratable subscription or once the entire commitment is used in the case of a delivered-as-used subscription, they are charged for their incremental usage.\nUsage is measured primarily by the number of hosts or by the volume of data indexed. A host is generally defined as a server, either in the cloud or on-premise. Our infrastructure monitoring, APM and network performance monitoring products are priced per host, our logs product is priced primarily per log events indexed and secondarily by events ingested. Customers also have the option to purchase additional products, such as additional container or serverless monitoring, custom metrics packages, anomaly detection, synthetic monitoring and app analytics.\nIn the case of subscriptions for committed contractual amounts of usage, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription agreement, generally beginning on the date that our platform is made available to a customer. As a result, much of our revenue is generated from subscriptions entered into during previous periods. Consequently, any decreases in new subscriptions or renewals in any one period may not be immediately reflected as a decrease in revenue for that period, but could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. This also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through the sale of additional subscriptions in any period, as revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription agreement. In the case of a subscription for a committed contractual amount of usage that is delivered as used, a monthly subscription based on usage, or usage in excess of a ratable subscription, we recognize revenue as the product is used, which may lead to fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. In addition, historically, we have experienced seasonality in new customer bookings, as we typically enter into a higher percentage of subscription agreements with new customers in the fourth quarter of the year.\nDue to ease of implementation of our products, professional services generally are not required and revenue from such services has been immaterial to date.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of expenses related to providing our products to customers, including payments to our third-party cloud infrastructure providers for hosting our software, personnel-related expenses for operations and global support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, payment processing fees, information technology, depreciation and amortization related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and internal-use software and other overhead costs such as allocated facilities.\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our platform infrastructure and our customer support and success organizations to expand the capability of our platform and ensure that our customers are realizing the full benefit of our \n47\nplatform and products. The level, timing and relative investment in our infrastructure could affect our cost of revenue in the future.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue fluctuates, and as a result of the timing and amount of investments to expand our products and geographical coverage.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and sales commissions. Operating expenses also include overhead costs for facilities and shared IT-related expenses, including depreciation expense.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineering, service and design teams. Additionally, research and development expense includes contractor fees, depreciation and amortization and allocated overhead costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred\n, with the exception of certain software development costs which are eligible for capitalization\n. We expect that our research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, particularly as we incur additional costs related to continued investments in our platform.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our sales and marketing organization, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, including the free tier and free introductory trials of our products, travel-related expenses, amortization of acquired customer relationships, and allocated overhead costs. Sales commissions earned by our sales force are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be four years. We expect that our sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales and marketing efforts.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative functions. In addition, general and administrative expense includes non-personnel costs, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees, hardware and software costs, certain tax, license and insurance-related expenses and allocated overhead costs. We expect that our general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows.\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nOther income (loss), net consists of interest income, primarily due to income earned on money market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and on marketable securities, partially offset by interest expense due on the Notes and amortization of premiums on our marketable securities.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We recorded a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\n48\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nRevenue\n$\n2,684,275 \n$\n2,128,359 \n$\n1,675,100 \nCost of revenue \n(1)(2)(3)\n515,531 \n409,908 \n346,743 \nGross profit\n2,168,744 \n1,718,451 \n1,328,357 \nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development \n(1)(3)\n1,152,703 \n962,447 \n752,351 \nSales and marketing \n(1)(2)(3)\n756,605 \n609,276 \n495,288 \nGeneral and administrative \n(1)(3)\n205,152 \n180,192 \n139,413 \nTotal operating expenses\n2,114,460 \n1,751,915 \n1,387,052 \nOperating income (loss)\n54,284 \n(33,464)\n(58,695)\nOther income:\nInterest expense \n(4)\n(7,068)\n(6,302)\n(16,535)\nInterest income and other income, net\n156,724 \n100,001 \n37,160 \nOther income, net\n149,656 \n93,699 \n20,625 \nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes\n203,940 \n60,235 \n(38,070)\nProvision for income taxes\n20,194 \n11,667 \n12,090 \nNet income (loss)\n$\n183,746 \n$\n48,568 \n$\n(50,160)\n____________________\n(1)\nIncludes stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue\n$\n26,221 \n$\n17,578 \n$\n10,827 \nResearch and development\n363,301 \n313,096 \n237,120 \nSales and marketing\n122,079 \n101,937 \n76,735 \nGeneral and administrative\n58,735 \n49,689 \n38,472 \nTotal\n$\n570,336 \n$\n482,300 \n$\n363,154 \n____________________\n(2)\nIncludes amortization of acquired intangibles expense as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue\n$\n5,642 \n$\n8,041 \n$\n6,750 \nSales and marketing\n825 \n825 \n825 \nTotal\n$\n6,467 \n$\n8,866 \n$\n7,575 \n_____________________\n(3)\nIncludes employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions as follows:\n49\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue\n$\n446 \n$\n364 \n$\n266 \nResearch and development\n31,134 \n21,449 \n10,384 \nSales and marketing\n4,694 \n5,917 \n2,766 \nGeneral and administrative\n6,852 \n4,811 \n830 \nTotal\n$\n43,126 \n$\n32,541 \n$\n14,246 \n____________________\n(4)\nIncludes amortization of issuance costs as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nInterest expense\n$\n3,761 \n$\n3,388 \n$\n3,369 \nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(as a percentage of total revenue\n(1)\n)\nRevenue\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nCost of revenue\n19 \n19 \n21 \nGross profit\n81 \n81 \n79 \nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development\n43 \n45 \n45 \nSales and marketing\n28 \n29 \n30 \nGeneral and administrative\n8 \n8 \n8 \nTotal operating expenses\n79 \n82 \n83 \nOperating income (loss)\n2 \n(2)\n(4)\nOther income:\nInterest expense\n— \n— \n(1)\nInterest income and other income, net\n6 \n5 \n2 \nOther income, net\n6 \n4 \n1 \nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes\n8 \n3 \n(2)\nProvision for income taxes\n1 \n1 \n1 \nNet income (loss)\n7 \n%\n2 \n%\n(3)\n%\n_____________________\n(1)\nCertain items may not total due to rounding.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n% Change\nRevenue\n$\n2,684,275 \n$\n2,128,359 \n$\n555,916 \n26 \n%\n50\nRevenue increased by $555.9 million or 26%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \nApproximately 75% of the increase in revenue was attributable to growth from existing customers, and the remaining 25% was attributable to growth from new customers.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nCost of revenue\n$\n515,531 \n$\n409,908 \n$\n105,623 \n26 \n%\nGross margin\n81 \n%\n81 \n%\nCost of revenue increased by $105.6 million, or 26%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

This increase was primarily driven by an increase of $51.9 million in interest income, mainly due to income earned from investments in marketable securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collection from sales of subscriptions to our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel expenses, hosting expenses, facility expenses, and marketing expenses. We have generated positive cash flows from operations during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. When assessing sources of liquidity, we also include cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion and marketable securities of $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2024. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support our cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond.\nOur working capital requirements principally consist of workforce salaries, bonuses, commissions, and benefits and, to a lesser extent, cancellable and non-cancelable licenses and services arrangements that are integral to our business operations, and operating lease obligations. Non-cancelable purchase commitments for business operations and operating lease obligations total $1.4 billion and $365.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, due primarily over the next five years. Purchase commitments for business operations are primarily related to cloud hosting and other software-based services.\nWe have also issued long-term debt to finance our business. In June 2020 and December 2024, we issued $747.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes, respectively, in private placements to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The total net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 Notes and the 2029 Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $730.2 million and $979.1 million, respectively. The principal and future interest payments related to our 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes are $635.9 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. We used $196.8 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the 2029 Notes to repurchase approximately $112.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest, in privately negotiated transactions. In connection with the partial retirement of the 2025 Notes, we entered into a termination agreement relating to a number of options corresponding to the number of 2025 Notes retired. We received approximately $54.7 million in connection with such termination agreements. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our 2025 Notes or the 2029 Notes, through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented:\n52\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(in thousands)\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n870,603 \n$\n659,954 \nCash used in investing activities\n(736,840)\n(731,365)\nCash provided by financing activities\n787,083 \n58,279 \nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $210.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in non-cash charges of $106.8 million, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $38.9 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $17.2 million. The increase in non-cash charges related primarily to an increase of $88.0 million in stock-based compensation as we continued to increase headcount to support the growth of the business. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue of $33.4 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $32.2 million, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $13.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $5.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in the purchases of marketable securities of $95.2 million, a decrease in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $36.8 million, an increase in the capitalization of software development costs of $26.0 million, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of $154.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $728.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes of $978.9 million and proceeds from the termination of Capped Calls related to the 2025 Notes of $54.7 million. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by repayments of the 2025 Notes of $196.8 million and purchases of Capped Calls related to the 2029 Notes of $100.9 million. \nNon-GAAP Free Cash Flow\nWe report our financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we provide investors with the amount of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs, if any. Free cash flow is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in our business. The reduction of capital expenditures and amounts capitalized for software development facilitates comparisons of our liquidity on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our liquidity. Nevertheless, our use of free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Further, our definition of free cash flow may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. You should consider free cash flow alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, such as net cash used in operating activities, and our other GAAP financial results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, for each of the periods indicated:\n53\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n870,603 \n$\n659,954 \n$\n418,407 \nLess: Purchases of property and equipment\n(34,719)\n(27,586)\n(35,261)\nLess: Capitalized software development costs\n(60,781)\n(34,820)\n(29,628)\nFree cash flow\n$\n775,103 \n$\n597,548 \n$\n353,518 \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 2, \nBasis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe \ngenerate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to customers using our cloud-based platform. The terms of our subscription agreements are primarily monthly or annual, with the majority of our revenue coming from annual subscriptions. Our customers can enter into a subscription for a committed contractual amount of usage that is apportioned ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the subscription period, a subscription for a committed contractual amount of usage that is delivered as used, or a monthly subscription based on usage. To the extent that our customers’ usage exceeds the committed contracted amounts under their subscriptions, either on a monthly basis in the case of a ratable subscription or once the entire commitment is used in the case of a delivered-as-used subscription, they are charged for their incremental usage\n.\nWe account for revenue contracts with \ncustomers\n through the following steps:\n(1)\nidentify the contract with a customer;\n(2)\nidentify\n \nthe\n \nperformance\n \nobligations\n \nin the\n \ncontract;\n(3)\ndetermine\n \nthe\n \ntransaction\n \nprice;\n(4)\nallocate\n \nthe\n \ntransaction\n \nprice to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n(5)\nrecognize\n \nrevenue\n \nwhen or as we satisfy\n \na performance\n \nobligation.\nOur subscriptions are generally non-cancellable. Once we have determined the transaction price, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, or SSP. The determination of a relative stand-alone SSP for each distinct performance obligation requires judgment. We determine SSP for performance obligations based on overall pricing objectives, which take into consideration market conditions and customer-specific factors. This includes a review of internal discounting tables, the service(s) being sold, and customer demographics.\nRevenue is recognized when \ncontrol\n of these services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those services. We determine an output method to be the most appropriate measure of progress because it most faithfully represents when the value of the services is simultaneously received and consumed by the customer, and control is transferred.\nFor committed contractual \namounts\n of usage, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription agreement generally beginning on the date that the platform is made available to a customer. For committed contractual amount of usage that is delivered as used, a monthly subscription based on usage, or usage in excess of a ratable subscription, we recognize revenue as the services are rendered.\n54\nInternal-Use Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs related to the development of our platform and other software applications for internal-use. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. We stop capitalizing these costs when the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, including the completion of all significant testing. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be two years. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditure will result in additional functionality and expense costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and enhancements. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria together with costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed as incurred and recorded within research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe exercise judgment in determining the point at which various projects may be capitalized, in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized. To the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our platform, assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized, the amount of internal-use software development costs we capitalize and amortize could change in future periods.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we acquire a business, the purchase consideration is allocated to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated respective fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to other income, net in the consolidated statement of operations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Part II, Item 8.
