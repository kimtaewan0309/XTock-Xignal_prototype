Houston Electric does not make direct retail or wholesale sales of electric energy or own or operate any power generating facilities other than leased TEEEF.\nElectric Transmission\n \nOn behalf of REPs, Houston Electric delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers taking power at or above 69 kV in locations throughout Houston Electric’s certificated service territory. Houston Electric constructs and maintains transmission facilities and provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the PUCT.\nElectric Distribution\n \nHouston Electric’s distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity for REPs in its certificated service area by carrying lower-voltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer through distribution feeders. Houston Electric’s operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities, metering services, outage response services and call center operations. Houston Electric provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the PUCT. PUCT rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants. Rates for these services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the PUCT.\nTemporary Generation. \nAs allowed by a law enacted by the Texas legislature after the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and amended in 2023, Houston Electric is leasing TEEEF that can aid in restoring power to customers during certain significant power outages that are \n2\nimpacting its distribution system. On December 19, 2024, Houston Electric announced a proposal to release certain of Houston Electric’s TEEEF to the San Antonio area prior to the summer of 2025 for a period of up to two years, during which Houston Electric would not receive revenue or profit from ERCOT and would not charge Houston-area customers for these TEEEF units. As of December 31, 2024, Houston Electric leased 505 MW of TEEEF. For more information, see  “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Executive Summary — Significant Events — May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, as well as Note 7 and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\nBond Companies\nHouston Electric has special purpose subsidiaries consisting of the Bond Companies, which it consolidates. These consolidated special purpose subsidiaries are wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote entities that were formed solely for the purpose of purchasing and owning transition or system restoration property through the issuance of Securitization Bonds, and conducting activities incidental thereto. The Securitization Bonds issued by Bond Company IV were repaid through charges imposed on customers in Houston Electric’s service territory. Restoration Bond Company repaid in full its last outstanding system restoration bonds at maturity on August 15, 2022, and was subsequently dissolved in 2024. On October 15, 2024, Bond Company IV repaid in full its last outstanding transition bonds at maturity. For further discussion of the Securitization Bonds issued by Bond Company IV and the outstanding balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCustomers\n \nHouston Electric serves nearly all of the Houston/Galveston metropolitan area near the Texas Gulf Coast. Houston Electric’s customers consist of REPs, which sell electricity to metered customers in Houston Electric’s certificated service area, and municipalities, electric cooperatives and other distribution companies located outside Houston Electric’s certificated service area. Each REP is licensed by, and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by, the PUCT. Houston Electric does not have long-term contracts with any of its customers, but rather operates using a continuous billing cycle, with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to REPs each business day. For information regarding Houston Electric’s major customers, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. \nThe table below reflects the number of REPs and metered customers in Houston Electric’s service area as of December 31, 2024:\n \nREPs\nResidential\nCommercial/\nIndustrial\nTotal Customers\nTexas Gulf Coast \n67 \n2,506,284 \n312,059 \n2,818,343 \nCompetition\n \nThere are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in Houston Electric’s service area. For another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in Houston Electric’s territory, it would be required to obtain a CCN from the PUCT and, depending on the location of the facilities, may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities. Houston Electric is not aware of any other party intending to enter this business in its service area at this time. Distributed generation (i.e., power generation located at or near the point of consumption) could result in a reduction of demand for Houston Electric’s distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date.\n \nSeasonality\n \nHouston Electric’s revenues are primarily derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of that REP. Houston Electric’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months when more electricity is used for cooling purposes.\nFranchises\n \nHouston Electric holds non-exclusive franchises from certain incorporated municipalities in its service territory. In exchange for the payment of fees, these franchises give Houston Electric the right to use the streets and public rights-of-way of these municipalities to construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to \n3\nconduct its electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit. The terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 30 to 40 years.\nIndiana Electric (CenterPoint Energy)\nIndiana Electric consists of SIGECO’s electric transmission and distribution services, including its electric generation assets and wholesale power operations. The table below reflects the number of metered customers to whom Indiana Electric supplied electric service as of December 31, 2024: \n \nResidential\nCommercial/Industrial\nTotal Customers\nSouthwestern Indiana\n133,866 \n19,541 \n153,407 \nSystem Load\nTotal load and the related reserve margin at the time of the system summer peak on August 29, 2024, is presented below in MW, except for reserve margin at peak:\n2024\nTotal load at peak\n1,062 \nGenerating capability\n720 \nPurchase supply (effective capacity) (1)\n698 \nInterruptible contracts & direct load control\n15 \nTotal power supply capacity\n1,433 \nReserve margin at peak\n35 \n%\n(1)\nIndiana Electric procured bi-lateral capacity contracts starting in the 2023-2024 MISO planning year. These contracts were procured before MISO moved to a seasonal construct, which allowed several generating units to receive accreditation in the summer season that would not have received any accreditation under MISO's previous annual construct. This resulted in a reserve margin that is higher than normal in the summer, but was limited to the summer season.\nThe winter peak load for the 2023-2024 season of approximately 835 MW occurred on January 16, 2024. \nSolar and Wind\nIndiana Electric has entered into various PPAs to purchase solar power and wind power to meet its future generation needs as reported in the table below:\nPower Type\nCounterparty\nLocation\nExpected Date in Service\nCapacity\n(MW)\nTerm\n(in Years)\nSolar\nClenera, LLC\nWarrick County, Indiana\n2026\n100 \n25\nSolar\nOriden\nVermillion County, Indiana\n2026\n185 \n15\nSolar\nOrigis\nKnox County, Indiana\n2026\n150 \n20\nWind\nNextEra Energy, Inc.\nKnox County, Illinois\n2026\n147 \n25\n582 \nFor further information about Indiana Electric’s solar power and wind power activities, see “Item 2. Properties” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\n \nCoal Purchases\n4\nCoal for coal-fired generating stations has been supplied from operators of nearby coal mines as there are substantial coal reserves in the southern Indiana area. Major suppliers are those that account for greater than 10% of Indiana Electric’s coal purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Sunrise LLC accounted for 88% of Indiana Electric’s coal purchases, with the remaining 12% being purchased from other suppliers.\nThe table below presents information related to coal purchases during the year ended December 31, 2024 and coal inventory as of December 31, 2024:\n(In tons, except average cost per ton)\nCoal purchased for generating electricity\n883,308 \nCoal inventory as of December 31, 2024\n263,321 \nAverage cost of coal per ton\n$54.41\nFirm Purchase Supply\nIndiana Electric enters into long-term purchase supply agreements to meet its generation needs as disclosed below: \nFuel Type\nProvider\nLocation\nContract Expiration\nCapacity\n(MW)\nPurchased in 2024\n  (in GWh)\nCoal\nOVEC (1)\nIndiana and Ohio\n2040\n32 \n178 \nWind\nBenton County Wind Farm, LLC\nBenton County, Indiana\n2028\n30 \n83 \nWind\nFowler Ridge II Wind Farm, LLC\nBenton/Tippecanoe Counties, Indiana\n2029\n50 \n134 \n112 \n395 \n(1)\nAs part of its power portfolio, Indiana Electric is a 1.5% shareholder in the OVEC. Based on its participation in the ICPA between OVEC and its shareholder companies, Indiana Electric has the right to 1.5% of OVEC’s generating capacity output and shares in 1.5% of the operating expenses and debt obligations of OVEC.\n \nMISO-Related Activity\nIndiana Electric is a member of the MISO, a FERC-approved regional transmission organization. The MISO serves the electric transmission needs of much of the Midcontinent region and maintains operational control over Indiana Electric’s electric transmission facilities and generation facilities as well as other utilities in the region. Indiana Electric is an active participant in the MISO energy markets, bidding its owned generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procuring power for its retail customers at Locational Marginal Pricing as determined by the MISO market. MISO-related purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by the MISO. These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on at least a net hourly position. \nMISO-related activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 was as follows:\nIn GWh\nNet purchases (1)\n2,406 \nNet sales (2)\n— \n(1)\nRepresents intervals when purchases from the MISO were in excess of generation sold to the MISO.\n(2)\nRepresents intervals when sales to the MISO were in excess of purchases from the MISO. Net sales were insignificant during 2024 primarily due to the retirement of SIGECO’s A.B. Brown coal generating facilities in 2023 and SIGECO’s exit from joint operations in the Warrick 4 coal generating facility on January 1, 2024.\nInterconnections\nAs of December 31, 2024, Indiana Electric had interconnections with Louisville Gas and Electric Company, Duke Energy Shared Services, Inc., Indianapolis Power & Light Company, Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Big Rivers Electric Corporation providing the ability to simultaneously interchange approximately 645 MW during peak load periods. Indiana Electric, as required as a member of the MISO, has turned over operational control of the interchange facilities \n5\nand its own transmission assets to the MISO. Indiana Electric, in conjunction with the MISO, must operate the bulk electric transmission system in accordance with NERC Reliability Standards. As a result, interchange capability varies based on regional transmission system configuration, generation dispatch, seasonal facility ratings and other factors. Indiana Electric is in compliance with reliability standards promulgated by NERC. \nSIGECO Securitization Subsidiary\nSIGECO has a special purpose subsidiary, SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary, which it consolidates. This consolidated special purpose subsidiary is a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote entity that was formed solely for the purpose of facilitating the securitization financing of qualified costs. The obligations of the SIGECO Securitization Bonds are repaid through charges imposed on customers in Indiana Electric’s service territory. For further discussion of the SIGECO Securitization Bonds and the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2024, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCompetition\nThere are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in Indiana Electric’s service area. Indiana Electric is a vertically integrated utility that owns the generation, transmission, and distribution components of a utility.\nFor another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in Indiana Electric’s territory, it would be required to obtain IURC approval of such service territory. Indiana service territory certificates are exclusive. Distributed generation (i.e., power generation located at or near the point of consumption) could result in reduced demand for Indiana Electric’s distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date.\nSeasonality\nIndiana Electric’s revenues are primarily derived from rates that it collects from customers in its service territory based on the amount of electricity it delivers. Indiana Electric’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months when more electricity is used for cooling purposes, and during the cooler months when more electricity is used for heating purposes.\nNatural Gas (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)\nCenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas engage in regulated intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation and storage for, residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas provide permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies through CEIP. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas also provided services in Minnesota consisting of residential appliance repair and maintenance services along with HVAC equipment sales and home repair protection plans to natural gas customers in Indiana, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas through a third party as of December 31, 2024.\nFor information regarding the properties of the Natural Gas reportable segment, read “Properties — Natural Gas (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)” in Item 2 of this report, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nOn February 19, 2024, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement to sell its Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses. The transaction was approved by final orders issued by the MPSC on December 3, 2024 and by the LPSC on December 17, 2024.\n \nThe transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n6\nCustomers\nThe table below reflects the number of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas customers by state as of December 31, 2024: \n \nResidential\nCommercial/\nIndustrial/Transportation\nTotal Customers\nIndiana (Indiana Gas)\n606,536 \n55,745 \n662,281 \nLouisiana\n231,962 \n16,214 \n248,176 \nMinnesota\n859,065 \n72,890 \n931,955 \nMississippi\n123,175 \n13,152 \n136,327 \nOhio\n310,541 \n24,589 \n335,130 \nTexas\n1,827,305 \n111,369 \n1,938,674 \nTotal CERC Natural Gas\n3,958,584 \n293,959 \n4,252,543 \nIndiana (SIGECO)\n105,344 \n10,647 \n115,991 \nTotal CenterPoint Energy Natural Gas\n4,063,928 \n304,606 \n4,368,534 \nThe largest metropolitan areas served in each state were Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Shreveport, Louisiana; Biloxi, Mississippi; Evansville, Indiana; and Dayton, Ohio.\nThe table below reflects the percentage of total throughput by customer type for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n \n \nCenterPoint Energy\nCERC\nResidential\n31 \n%\n32 \n%\nCommercial/Industrial and Transportation\n69 \n%\n68 \n%\nTotal Throughput\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nSeasonality\nThe demand for natural gas sales to residential customers and natural gas sales and transportation for commercial and industrial customers is seasonal and affected by variations in weather conditions. In 2024, approximately 64% and 65% of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas total throughput occurred in the first and fourth quarters, respectively. These patterns reflect the higher demand for natural gas for heating purposes during the colder months.\nSupply and Transportation\nIn 2024, CenterPoint Energy’s Natural Gas purchased virtually all of its natural gas supply pursuant to contracts with remaining terms varying from a few months to three years. Major suppliers are those that account for greater than 10% of CenterPoint Energy’s or CERC’s annual natural gas supply purchases. \nMajor suppliers of natural gas for the year ended December 31, 2024 were as follows: \n \nCenterPoint Energy\nCERC\nTenaska Marketing Ventures, LLC\n33 \n%\n31 \n%\nBP Energy Company\n11 \n%\n12 \n%\nMacquarie Energy, LLC\n11 \n%\n11 \n%\nTotal of major suppliers\n55 \n%\n54 \n%\nNumerous other suppliers provided the remainder of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s natural gas supply requirements.\nCenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas transports their natural gas supplies through various intrastate and interstate pipelines under contracts with remaining terms, including extensions, varying from one to fifteen years. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas anticipates that these gas supply and transportation contracts will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration.\n7\nCenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas actively engage in commodity price stabilization pursuant to annual gas supply plans presented to and/or filed with each of its state regulatory authorities. These price stabilization activities include use of storage gas and contractually establishing structured prices (e.g., fixed price, costless collars and caps) with CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas’ physical gas suppliers. Their gas supply plans generally call for 50–75% of normal winter supplies to be stabilized in some fashion.\n \nThe regulations of the states in which CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas operate allow them to pass through changes in the cost of natural gas, including savings and costs of financial derivatives associated with the index-priced physical supply, to their customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in their tariffs. Depending upon the jurisdiction, the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated periodically, ranging from monthly to semi-annually. The changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the applicable regulatory bodies.\n \nCenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas use various third-party storage services or owned natural gas storage facilities to meet peak-day requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas may also supplement contracted supplies and storage from time to time with stored LNG and propane-air plant production.\nOn an ongoing basis, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas enter into contracts to provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet their customer requirements. However, it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions, transportation constraints and other events. As a result of these factors, supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time, or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors.\n \nCenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas businesses continue to utilize AMAs associated with their utility distribution service in Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas. Generally, AMAs are contracts between CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets. In these agreements, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas agrees to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage natural gas storage, supply and delivery arrangements for CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas may receive compensation from the asset manager through payments made over the life of the AMAs. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas has an obligation to purchase their winter storage requirements that have been released to the asset manager under these AMAs. The AMAs have varying terms, the longest of which expires in 2029. Pursuant to the provisions of the agreements, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas either sells natural gas to the asset manager and agrees to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas throughout the year at the same cost, or simply purchases its full natural gas requirements at each delivery point from the asset manager. For amounts outstanding under these AMAs, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCompetition\n \nCenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas compete primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other gas distributors and marketers also compete directly for gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulations affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas’ facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers.\nCorporate and Other (CenterPoint Energy)\nCenterPoint Energy’s Corporate and Other consists of corporate support operations that support CenterPoint Energy’s business operations and also includes office buildings and other real estate used for business operations.  CenterPoint Energy’s Corporate and Other also consisted of energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services by Energy Systems Group through June 30, 2023, the date of the sale of Energy Systems Group. For additional information on the sale of Energy Systems Group, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nREGULATION\nThe Registrants are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local governmental agencies, including the regulations described below. The following discussion is based on regulation in the Registrants’ businesses as of December 31, 2024.\n8\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission\nFERC has jurisdiction under the NGA and the NGPA, as amended, to regulate the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and natural gas sales for resale in interstate commerce that are not first sales. FERC regulates, among other things, the construction of pipeline and related facilities used in the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of these facilities. FERC also regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, mergers, acquisitions and corporate transactions by electricity companies, energy markets, reliability standards and the issuance of short-term debt by public utilities regulated by FERC. FERC has authority to prohibit market manipulation in connection with FERC-regulated transactions, to conduct audits and investigations, and to impose significant civil penalties (up to approximately $1.6 million per day per violation, subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation) for statutory violations and violations of the FERC’s rules or orders.\nIndiana Electric is a “public utility” under the FPA and is subject to regulation by FERC. Houston Electric is not a “public utility” under the FPA and, therefore, is not generally regulated by FERC, although certain of its transactions are subject to limited FERC jurisdiction. FERC has certain responsibilities with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT. FERC has designated NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The ERO and FERC have authority to (a) impose fines and other sanctions on applicable entities that fail to comply with approved standards and (b) audit compliance with approved standards. FERC has approved the delegation by NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE and in MISO to ReliabilityFirst Corporation. Neither Houston Electric nor Indiana Electric anticipate that the reliability standards proposed by NERC and approved by FERC will have a material adverse impact on their operations. To the extent that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are required to make additional expenditures to comply with these standards, it is anticipated that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric will seek to recover those costs through the transmission charges that are imposed on all distribution service providers within ERCOT and the MISO, respectively, for electric transmission provided.\nAs a public utility holding company, under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, CenterPoint Energy and its consolidated subsidiaries are subject to reporting and accounting requirements and are required to maintain certain books and records and make them available for review by FERC and state regulatory authorities in certain circumstances.\nFor a discussion of the Registrants’ ongoing regulatory proceedings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nState and Local Regulation – Electric Transmission & Distribution (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)\nHouston Electric is a member of ERCOT, which serves as the independent system operator and regional reliability coordinator for member electric power systems in most of Texas. The ERCOT market represents approximately 90% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation’s largest power markets. The ERCOT market operates under the reliability standards developed by NERC, approved by FERC and monitored and enforced by the Texas RE. The PUCT has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the state’s main interconnected power transmission grid. \nThe ERCOT ISO is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ERCOT market. Houston Electric’s transmission business, along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in Texas, supports the operation of the ERCOT ISO. Houston Electric participates with the ERCOT ISO and other ERCOT utilities to plan, design, obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ERCOT transmission grid.\nHouston Electric conducts its operations pursuant to a CCN issued by the PUCT that covers its present service area and facilities. The PUCT and certain municipalities have the authority to set the rates and terms of service provided by Houston Electric under cost-of-service rate regulation. Houston Electric holds non-exclusive franchises from certain incorporated municipalities in its service territory. In exchange for payment of fees, these franchises give Houston Electric the right to use the streets and public rights-of-way of these municipalities to construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit. The terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 30 to 40 years.\nIn ERCOT, end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated REPs. Houston Electric’s distribution rates charged to REPs for residential and small commercial customers are primarily based on amounts of energy delivered, whereas \n9\ndistribution rates for a majority of large commercial and industrial customers are primarily based on peak demand. All REPs in Houston Electric’s service area pay the same rates and other charges for transmission and distribution services. This regulated delivery charge may include the transmission and distribution rate (which includes municipal franchise fees), a DCRF mechanism for recovery of incremental distribution-invested capital above that which is already reflected in the base distribution rate, a TEEEF mechanism for recovery of costs associated with leasing and operating TEEEF, a TCRF mechanism for recovery of approved wholesale transmission cost changes billed by a transmission service provider, a nuclear decommissioning charge associated with decommissioning the South Texas nuclear generating facility, an EECRF charge, and charges associated with securitization of regulatory assets, stranded costs and restoration costs. Transmission rates charged to distribution companies are based on amounts of energy transmitted under “postage stamp” rates that do not vary with the distance the energy is being transmitted. All distribution companies in ERCOT pay Houston Electric the same rates and other charges for transmission services.\nWith the IURC’s approval, Indiana Electric is a member of the MISO, a FERC-approved regional transmission organization.  The MISO serves the electrical transmission needs of much of the Midcontinent region and maintains operational control over Indiana Electric’s electric transmission and generation facilities as well as those of other utilities in the region. Indiana Electric is an active participant in the MISO energy markets, bidding its owned generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procuring power for its retail customers at Locational Marginal Pricing as determined by the MISO market. Indiana Electric also receives transmission revenue that results from other members’ use of Indiana Electric’s transmission system. Generally, these transmission revenues, along with costs charged by the MISO, are considered components of base rates and any variance from that included in base rates is recovered from or refunded to retail customers through tracking mechanisms.\nFor a discussion of certain of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ongoing regulatory proceedings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nState and Local Regulation – Electric Generation (CenterPoint Energy)\nThe energy and capacity secured from Indiana Electric’s available generation resources are utilized primarily to serve the needs of retail electric customers residing within Indiana Electric’s franchised service territory. Costs of operating Indiana Electric’s generation facilities are recovered through IURC-approved base rates as well as periodic rate recovery mechanisms including the CECA, ECA, FAC, MCRA, and RCRA mechanism. Costs that are deemed unreasonable or imprudent by the IURC may not be recoverable through retail electric rates. Indiana Electric also receives revenues from the MISO to compensate it for benefits the generation facilities provide to the transmission system. Proceeds from the sales of energy from Indiana Electric’s generation facilities that exceed the requirements of retail customers are shared by Indiana Electric and retail electric customers.\nThe generation facilities owned and operated by Indiana Electric are subject to various environmental regulations enforced by the EPA and the IDEM. Operations of Indiana Electric’s generation facilities are subject to regulation by the EPA and the IDEM as it pertains to the discharge of constituents from the generation facilities. For further discussion, see “Our Business — Environmental Matters” below. \nFor a discussion of Indiana Electric’s ongoing regulatory proceedings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nState and Local Regulation – Natural Gas (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)\nIn almost all communities in which CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas provides natural gas distribution services, they operate under franchises, certificates or licenses obtained from state and local authorities. The original terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 20 to 30 years. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas expects to be able to renew expiring franchises. In most cases, franchises to provide natural gas utility services are not exclusive.\nSubstantially all of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas is subject to cost-of-service rate regulation by the relevant state public utility commissions and, in Texas, by those municipalities that have retained original jurisdiction.  In certain of the jurisdictions in which they operate, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas have annual rate adjustment mechanisms that provide for changes in rates dependent upon certain changes in invested capital, earned returns on equity or actual margins realized.  \n10\n \nFor a discussion of certain of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas’ ongoing regulatory proceedings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.\nDepartment of Transportation (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)\nCenterPoint Energy and CERC are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the NGPSA and the HLPSA. The NGPSA delegated to PHMSA through DOT the authority to regulate gas pipelines. The HLPSA delegated to PHMSA through DOT the authority to develop, prescribe and enforce federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline. Every four years PHMSA is up for reauthorization by Congress and with that reauthorization comes changes to the legislative requirements that Congress sets forth for the oversight of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. In 2020, the PIPES Act was enacted. The PIPES Act reauthorized PHMSA through 2023 and imposed a few new mandates on the agency. The law establishes a PHMSA technology pilot, authorizes a new idled pipe operating status and contains process protections for operators during PHMSA enforcement proceedings. Section 114 of the PIPES Act is a self-mandating rule for natural gas pipeline operations like CERC’s that focuses on processes and procedures to eliminate or reduce emissions during normal operations. Further, Section 113 of the PIPES Act directed PHMSA to develop regulations to require natural gas pipeline operators to implement leak detection and repair programs, as well as requirements for mitigating emissions in operations.  The PIPES Act of 2023 was approved by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on December 6, 2023 to reauthorize PHMSA’s safety programs for the next four years.  Final versions of the Section 113 Leak Detection and Repair, and Safety of Natural Gas Distribution Pipelines, 2020 PIPES Act rules remain frozen until a Department of Transportation appointee can review and proceed further.\nIn January 2021, PHMSA published a final rule amending the federal Pipeline Safety Regulations to ease regulatory burdens on the construction, operation, and maintenance of gas transmission, distribution, and gathering systems.\nCenterPoint Energy and CERC anticipate that compliance with PHMSA’s regulations, performance of the remediation activities by CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas and intrastate pipelines, and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will continue to require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs. The level of expenditures will depend upon several factors, including age, location and operating pressures of the facilities. In particular, the cost of compliance with the DOT’s integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing. Changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management, whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas, may also affect the costs incurred. Implementation by PHMSA of the PIPES Act, in particular the final rule implementing Section 113, acts reauthorizing PHMSA or other future acts may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact compliance costs. In addition, CenterPoint Energy and CERC may be subject to the DOT’s enforcement actions and penalties if they fail to comply with pipeline regulations.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nThe following discussion is based on environmental matters in the Registrants’ businesses as of December 31, 2024. The Registrants’ operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, electric transmission and distribution systems, steam electric and renewable generation systems and the facilities that support these systems, the Registrants must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact the Registrants’ business activities in many ways, including, but not limited to:\n•\nrestricting the way the Registrants can handle or dispose of wastes, including wastewater discharges and air emissions;\n•\nlimiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered species;\n•\nrequiring remedial action and monitoring to mitigate environmental conditions caused by the Registrants’ operations or attributable to former operations;\n•\nenjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and\n•\nimpacting the demand for the Registrants’ services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of fossil fuels, including, but not limited to, natural gas.\nTo comply with these requirements, the Registrants may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to, among other activities:\n11\n•\nconstruct or acquire new facilities and equipment;\n•\nacquire permits for facility operations or purchase emissions allowances;\n•\nmodify, upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment; and\n•\ndecommission or remediate waste management areas, fuel storage facilities and other locations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, the imposition of remedial actions and monitoring and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to assess, clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and/or property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.\nIncreasingly, environmental regulation has resulted in more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and monitoring, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts currently anticipated. The Registrants try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to maintain compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations. \nBased on current regulatory requirements and interpretations, the Registrants do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the Registrants believe that their current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish their operational ability. The Registrants cannot provide assurances that future events, such as changes in existing laws, the promulgation of new laws, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause them to incur significant costs. The following is a discussion of material current environmental and safety issues, laws and regulations that relate to the Registrants’ operations. The Registrants believe that they are in substantial compliance with these environmental laws and regulations.\nGreenhouse Gas and Climate Change-Related Regulation and Compliance \n(CenterPoint Energy)\nThere is increasing attention being paid in the United States and worldwide to the issue of climate change. As a result, from time to time, regulatory agencies have considered the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations addressing the emissions of GHG on the state, federal, or international level. The EPA released its initial GHG regulation for fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in 2015.  Since then, various iterations of GHG regulations have been promulgated, withdrawn and litigated, and the current rule applicable to fossil fuel-fired electric generating units was finalized in April 2024.  In April 2024, the EPA finalized the current New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, Reconstructed Fossil Fuel-Fired Units; and Repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, which applies new GHG performance standards for those existing coal-fired power plants expected to continue operation beyond December 31, 2029. The rule is currently being challenged by a variety of stakeholders in litigation before the Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  In October 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to stay the implementation of the rule while the rule is on judicial review. On February 19, 2021, the United States formally rejoined the Paris Agreement, which drove a renewed regulatory push to require further GHG emission reductions from the energy sector, and led negotiations at the global climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. On April 22, 2021, the United States announced goals of 50% reduction of economy-wide GHG emissions, and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035 from a 2021 baseline, which formed the basis of the U.S. commitments announced in Glasgow. Nevertheless, on January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, marking a significant shift in U.S. climate policy. Pursuant to the terms of the Paris Agreement, the withdrawal will take effect on January 27, 2026. Additionally, in January 2025, President Trump signed a series of executive orders that, among other things, (i) call upon the EPA to submit a report on the continuing applicability of its endangerment finding for GHGs under the Clean Air Act and issue guidance on the “social cost of carbon” to consider whether such metric should be eliminated, (ii) direct federal executive departments and agencies to initiate a regulatory freeze for certain rules that have not taken effect, pending review by the  newly appointed agency head, (iii) temporarily halt certain federal government agencies from issuing approvals, permits and loans for onshore wind projects pending the completion of certain assessments and reviews and (iv) pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the IRA and the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act.\nIn September 2021, CenterPoint Energy announced its net zero emissions goals for both Scope 1 emissions and certain Scope 2 emissions by 2035 as well as a goal to reduce certain Scope 3 emissions by 20% to 30% by 2035 from a 2021 baseline. Because Texas is an unregulated market, CenterPoint Energy’s Scope 2 emissions estimates do not take into account Texas electric transmission and distribution assets in the line loss calculation and, in addition, exclude emissions related to purchased power in Indiana between 2024 and 2026 as estimated. CenterPoint Energy’s Scope 3 emissions estimates are based on the total \n12\nnatural gas supply delivered to residential and commercial customers as reported in the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Form EIA-176 reports and do not take into account the emissions of transport customers and emissions related to upstream extraction. These emission goals are expected to be used to position CenterPoint Energy to comply with anticipated future regulatory requirements from any future administrations to further reduce GHG emissions. For more information regarding CenterPoint Energy’s net zero and GHG emissions reduction goals and their related risks, see “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Affecting Regulatory, Environmental and Legal Risks — CenterPoint Energy is subject to operational and financial risks ...” CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of their operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. The IRA established the Methane Emissions Reduction Program, which imposes a charge on methane emissions from certain natural gas transmission facilities, the rules for which were finalized on November 18, 2024, and the EPA published final, new regulations targeting reductions in methane emissions on March 8, 2024, which may increase costs related to production, transmission and storage of natural gas. \nCenterPoint Energy’s net zero emissions goals are aligned with Indiana Electric’s generation transition plan and are expected to position Indiana Electric to comply with anticipated future regulatory requirements related to GHG emissions reductions.  Houston Electric, in contrast to some electric utilities including Indiana Electric, does not generate electricity, other than through TEEEF, and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. Nevertheless, Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within their respective service territories. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or to use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for the Registrants’ services. For example, Minnesota has enacted the Natural Gas Innovation Act that seeks to provide customers with access to renewable energy resources and innovative technologies, with the goal of reducing GHG emissions. Further, certain local government bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or \nincentives to reduce energy consumption by certain specified dates. \nFor example, Minneapolis has adopted carbon emission reduction goals in an effort to decrease reliance on natural gas. \nAdditionally,\n cities in Minnesota within CenterPoint Energy’s Natural Gas operational footprint are considering initiatives to eliminate natural gas use in buildings and focus on electrification. Also, Minnesota cities may consider seeking legislative authority for the ability to enact voluntary enhanced energy standards for all development projects. These initiatives could have a significant impact on CenterPoint Energy and its operations, and this impact could increase if other cities and jurisdictions in its service area enact similar initiatives. Further, our third-party suppliers, vendors and partners may also be impacted by climate change laws and regulations, which could impact CenterPoint Energy’s business by, among other things, causing permitting and construction delays, project cancellations or increased project costs passed on to CenterPoint Energy.  Conversely, regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics relative to other fossil fuels would be expected to benefit CenterPoint Energy and CERC and their natural gas-related businesses. At this time, however, we cannot quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to GHG emissions, either positive or negative, on the Registrants’ businesses.  \nOn March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules that require the Registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. Litigation challenging the new rule was filed by multiple parties in multiple jurisdictions, which have been consolidated and assigned to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On April 4, 2024, the SEC announced that it is voluntarily delaying the implementation of the climate disclosure regulations while the U.S. Court of Appeals considers the litigation. While a majority of the reporting requirements would have been applicable to the Registrants in the fiscal year beginning in 2025, with the addition of assurance reporting for GHG inventories starting in 2029 for large accelerated filers, as of April 12, 2024, the effective date of the final rules has been delayed indefinitely and the SEC has indicated that it will publish a document in the Federal Register at the conclusion of the stay addressing a new effective date for the final rules. On February 11, 2025, the SEC notified the U.S. Court of Appeals of a statement issued by the SEC’s Acting Chairman regarding, among other things, the fact that the majority of current SEC Commissioners had previously voted against adopting the rules, and requested that the U.S. Court of Appeals not schedule the case for argument to provide time for the SEC to deliberate and determine the appropriate next steps in the cases. The Registrants continue to evaluate the impact of the final rules on their respective consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nCompliance costs and other effects associated with climate change, reductions in GHG emissions and obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain. Although the amount of compliance costs remains uncertain, any new regulation or legislation relating to climate change will likely result in an increase in compliance costs. While the requirements of a federal or state rule remain uncertain, CenterPoint Energy will continue to monitor regulatory activity regarding GHG emission standards that may affect its business. Currently, CenterPoint Energy does not purchase carbon credits. In connection with its net zero and GHG emissions goals, CenterPoint Energy expects to purchase carbon credits in the future; however, CenterPoint Energy does not currently expect the number of credits, or cost for those credits, to be material. \n13\nFor further information on climate change trends and uncertainties, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters — Climate Change Trends and Uncertainties” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.\nAir Emissions\nThe Registrants’ operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including electric generating facilities and natural gas processing plants and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions. The Registrants may be required to obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations, or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and potentially criminal enforcement actions. The Registrants may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.\nWater Discharges\nThe Registrants’ operations are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. The unpermitted discharge of pollutants, including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident, is prohibited. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material into wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from the Registrants’ pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligations.\nWaters of the United States \n In April 2020 the EPA proposed a new set of rules that sought to clarify the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction over “waters of the United States,” but that set of rules was later vacated by decisions in the U.S. federal district courts in New Mexico and Arizona. On December 30, 2022, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced the final “Revised Definition of ‘waters of the United States”’ rule, which was published on January 18, 2023 and became effective on March 20, 2023. However, on May 25, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision limiting the scope of federal jurisdiction over wetlands in the case of \nSackett v. Environmental Protection Agency\n, and on August 29, 2023, the EPA issued a final rule that seeks to conform with the U.S. Supreme Court decision. As a result of ongoing rulemaking litigation, the Registrants’ operations in all states with the exception of Minnesota fall under the pre-2015 regulatory regime consistent with the Supreme Court decision in \nSackett\n, while operations in Minnesota fall under the 2023 rule, as amended. CenterPoint Energy is unable to predict the outcome of current or future litigation or regulatory proceedings, but does not expect a material impact on its operations relating to these rules. CenterPoint Energy will continue to monitor regulatory and legal developments relating to the Clean Water Act that may affect its business.\nELG\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized revisions to the existing steam electric wastewater discharge standards, which set more stringent wastewater discharge limits and effectively prohibited further wet disposal of coal ash in ash ponds. In February 2019, the IURC approved Indiana Electric’s ELG Compliance Plan for its F.B. Culley Generating Station, which was completed in compliance with the requirements of ELG\n.\n \nOn April 25, 2024, the EPA released its final Supplemental ELG and Standards for the Steam Electric Generating Point Source Category. The Registrants currently anticipate that they will be in compliance with the Supplemental ELG Guidelines at the Culley facility due to previous wastewater treatment upgrades.\nCooling Water Intake Structures\nSection 316 of the federal Clean Water Act requires steam electric generating facilities use “best technology available” to minimize adverse environmental impacts on a body of water. In May 2014, the EPA finalized a regulation requiring installation of “best technology available” to mitigate impingement and entrainment of aquatic species in cooling water intake structures. Indiana Electric is currently completing the required ecological studies and anticipates timely compliance at its F.B. Culley facility in 2025.  \n14\nHazardous Waste\nThe Registrants’ operations generate wastes, including some hazardous wastes, that are subject to the federal RCRA, and comparable state laws, which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment, transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste. RCRA currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste. Specifically, RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous wastewaters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil and natural gas. However, these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements of RCRA. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste. The transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to RCRA or comparable state law requirements.\nCoal Ash \nIndiana Electric has three ash ponds, two at the F.B. Culley facility (Culley East and Culley West) and one at the A.B. Brown facility. In 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates coal ash as non-hazardous material under the RCRA. The final rule allows beneficial reuse of ash, and the majority of the ash generated by Indiana Electric’s remaining generating units will continue to be beneficially reused. Indiana Electric is required to perform integrity assessments, including ground water monitoring, at its F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown generating stations. The ground water studies were necessary to determine the remaining service life of the ponds and whether a pond must be retrofitted with liners or closed in place. Groundwater monitoring indicates potential groundwater impacts adjacent to Indiana Electric’s ash impoundments, and further analysis is ongoing. The CCR Rule required companies to complete location restriction determinations by October 18, 2018. Indiana Electric completed its evaluation and determined that one F.B. Culley pond (Culley East) and the A.B. Brown pond failed the aquifer placement location restriction. As a result of this failure, Indiana Electric was required to cease disposal of new ash in the ponds and commence closure of the ponds by April 11, 2021. Indiana Electric filed timely requests for extensions available under the CCR Rule that would allow Indiana Electric to continue to use the ponds through October 15, 2023. On January 22, 2021, Indiana Electric received letters from the EPA for both the F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown facilities that determined Indiana Electric’s extension submittals complete and extended the compliance deadline of April 11, 2021 until the EPA issues a final decision on the extension requests. On October 5, 2022, SIGECO received a proposed conditional approval of its extension request for the A.B. Brown facility. Both the Culley East and A.B. Brown facility have been taken out of service in a timely manner per the commitments made to the EPA in the extension requests filed for both ponds.\n \nThe Culley West pond was closed under CCR provisions applicable to inactive ponds, and closure activities were completed in December 2020. For further discussion about Indiana Electric’s ash ponds, see Note 14(d) to the consolidated financial statements. \nOn April 25, 2024, the EPA released its final Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System; Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities; Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments rule (CCR Legacy Rule), which was published in the federal register in May 2024. The CCR Legacy Rule requires companies to investigate previously closed impoundments that were used historically for ash disposal or locations which have had ash placed on them in amounts set forth in the CCR Legacy Rule. The Registrants have completed their preliminary review of potential sites that will require further investigation under the CCR Legacy Rule and identified certain sites in Indiana for further evaluation. For further discussion about Indiana Electric’s sites identified pursuant to the CCR Legacy Rule, see Note 14(d) to the consolidated financial statements. \nLiability for Remediation\nCERCLA, also known as “Superfund,” and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of “hazardous substances” into the environment. Classes of PRPs include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills. Although petroleum, as well as natural gas, is expressly excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance,” in the course of the Registrants’ ordinary operations they do, from time to time, generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a “hazardous substance.” CERCLA authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties, to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. Under CERCLA, the Registrants could potentially be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released, for damages to natural resources, and for associated response and assessment costs, including for the costs of certain health studies.\n15\nLiability for Preexisting Conditions\nFor information about preexisting environmental matters, see Note 14(d) to the consolidated financial statements.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nCenterPoint Energy believes its employees are critical to safely delivering electricity and natural gas across its service territories and seeks to create an open and safe work environment.

  "item7": "Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following combined discussion and analysis should be read in combination with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. The discussion of CenterPoint Energy’s consolidated financial information includes the results of CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp., which, along with CenterPoint Energy, Inc., are collectively referred to as the Registrants. Where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such. Unless the context indicates otherwise, specific references to Houston Electric and CERC also pertain to CenterPoint Energy. In this combined Form 10-K, the terms “our,” “we” and “us” are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Houston Electric and CERC, unless stated otherwise. No registrant makes any representations as to the information related solely to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. or the subsidiaries of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. other than itself. \nOVERVIEW\nBackground\nCenterPoint Energy is a public utility holding company. CenterPoint Energy’s operating subsidiaries own and operate electric transmission, distribution and generation facilities and natural gas distribution systems. For a detailed description of CenterPoint Energy’s operating subsidiaries, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nHouston Electric is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, which provides electric transmission service to transmission service customers in the ERCOT region and distribution service to REPs serving the Texas Gulf Coast area that includes the city of Houston. \nCERC Corp. is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy, which (i) directly owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas, (ii) indirectly, through Indiana Gas and CEOH, owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in Indiana and Ohio, respectively, and (iii) owns and operates permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies through CEIP. \nOn February 19, 2024, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement to sell its Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. \nReportable Segments\nWe discuss our operating results on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our reportable segments. We are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on these regulated segments. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, economic conditions, cost management, competition, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject, among other factors. \nBelow is a summary of CenterPoint Energy’s reportable segments as of December 31, 2024. For a detailed description of the assets included in each reporting segment, see Part I, Item 1. Business.\n•\nThe Electric reportable segment includes electric transmission and distribution services that are subject to rate regulation in Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s service territories, as well as the impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility and energy delivery services to electric customers and electric generation assets to serve electric customers and optimize those assets in the wholesale power market in Indiana Electric’s service territory.\n•\nThe Natural Gas reportable segment includes (i) intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation and distribution for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas; (ii) permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies through CEIP; and (iii) home appliance maintenance and repair services to customers in Minnesota and home repair protection plans to natural gas customers in Indiana, Mississippi, Ohio and Texas through a third party.\n49\n•\nThe Corporate and Other reportable segment includes (i) energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services by Energy Systems Group through June 30, 2023, the date of the sale of Energy Systems Group; (ii)  corporate operations that support the business operations of CenterPoint Energy; and (iii) office buildings and other real estate used for business operations.\nHouston Electric and CERC each consist of a single reportable segment.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWe expect our businesses to continue to be affected by the key factors and trends discussed below. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results. \nFactors Influencing Our Businesses and Industry Trends\nWe are an energy delivery company with electric transmission and distribution, power generation, and natural gas distribution operations that serve more than seven million metered customers across six jurisdictions. The majority of our revenues are generated from the transmission and delivery of electricity and the sale of natural gas by our subsidiaries.\nWe continue to execute on our strategic goals for our businesses which were set in 2021. These include our ten-year capital plan from 2021 through 2030, a focus on targeting controllable operations and maintenance savings for the benefit of our customers, prudent capital funding including divestitures of non-core assets, and net zero and GHG emissions reduction goals. Our focus continues to be on the growth of our regulated utility businesses including our electric and gas utility operations, which comprise over 95% of our earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nPursuant to this business strategy and in light of the nature of our businesses, significant amounts of capital investment are reflected in our current 10-year capital plan, which has increased to nearly $47.5 billion through 2030. These investments include a focus on additional system resiliency, reliability, and grid modernization. These investments are not only intended to meet our customers’ current needs, but are also in anticipation for further organic growth and load growth from increased electrification in our service territories. To fund these capital investments, we rely on internally-generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper, cash proceeds from strategic transactions (such as the divestitures of our Arkansas and Oklahoma LDC businesses in 2022, our Energy Systems Group divestiture in 2023 and the proposed sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025), and issuances of equity and debt in the capital markets, including the issuance of non-recourse securitization bonds at Houston Electric related to costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 due to the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl. \nWe strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. A reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. Disruptions in the financial markets along with high or rising interest rates can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. In those circumstances, we may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than we would otherwise accept which, among other things, would negatively impact our ability to finance our capital plan. For that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt. \nThe regulation of electric transmission, distribution and generation facilities as well as natural gas pipelines and related facilities by federal and state regulatory agencies affects our businesses. In accordance with applicable regulations, we are making, and will continue to make, significant capital investments in our service territories under our capital plan to help operate and maintain safer, more reliable and growing electric and natural gas systems. The current economic environment (e.g., sustained higher interest rates and higher relative levels of inflation in the United States) discussed further below could result in heightened regulatory scrutiny as these regulatory agencies seek to reduce the financial impact of utility bills on customers. \nWhile greater than 80% of CenterPoint Energy’s projected consolidated investments are expected to be recovered through interim capital recovery trackers or rate cases based on a forward test year, the balance is expected to be recovered through base rate cases.\n \nIndiana Electric filed a rate case during 2023, and Houston Electric and CERC’s Ohio jurisdiction filed rate cases in 2024. The outcome of these base rate proceedings will determine, among other things, the ability to recover certain capital \n50\ninvestments within those jurisdictions. The outcome of these base rate proceedings is uncertain and may be impacted by the current economic environment. CERC’s Texas and Minnesota gas jurisdictions filed rate cases in 2023, which were settled in 2024. For additional detail, see  “—Liquidity and Capital Resources —Regulatory Matters” below.\nTo assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors the recovery of costs and return on investments by the evaluation of net income and capital expenditures, among other things, from our regulated service territories within our reportable segments. Within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, natural gas and fuel costs, interest expense, capital spend, working capital requirements, and operation and maintenance expense. In addition to these financial measures, we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to gauge the performance of our reportable segments, including the number of customers, throughput, commodity prices, heating and cooling degree days, environmental impacts, safety factors, system reliability and customer satisfaction.\nCenterPoint Energy and CERC have weather normalization or other rate mechanisms that largely mitigate the impact of weather on Natural Gas in Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Minnesota and Ohio, as applicable. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas in Texas and CenterPoint Energy’s electric operations in Texas and Indiana do not have such mechanisms, although fixed customer charges are historically higher in Texas for Natural Gas compared to its other jurisdictions. As a result, fluctuations from normal weather may have a positive or negative effect on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas’ results in Texas and on CenterPoint Energy’s electric operations’ results in its Texas and Indiana service territories. \nEach state has a unique economy and is driven by different industrial sectors. Our largest customers reflect the diversity in industries in the states across our footprint. For example, Houston Electric is largely concentrated in Houston, a diverse economy where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country. Although the Houston area represents a large part of our customer base, we have a diverse customer base throughout the various states our utility businesses serve. In Minnesota, for instance, education and health services are the state’s largest sectors. Indiana and Ohio are impacted by changes in the Midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the Midwest such as automotive, feed and grain processing. Some industries are driven by population growth like education and health care, while others may be influenced by strength in the national or international economy. Adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment and increased availability of alternate energy sources, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. Long-term national trends indicate residential customers have reduced their energy consumption, which could adversely affect our results. To the extent population growth is affected by lower energy prices and there is financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry, there may be an impact on the growth rate of our customer base and overall demand. Management expects residential meter growth for Houston Electric to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 2%. Management additionally anticipates significant increased electric load growth demand in our Houston Electric service territory, including in relation to the expected expansion of data centers, energy export facilities, including hydrogen facilities, electrification of industrial processes and transport and logistics. Typical customer growth in the jurisdictions served by the Natural Gas reportable segment is approximately 1%. Management expects residential meter growth for CERC to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 1%. \nInflation and high interest rates and a recessionary environment could potentially adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s ability to execute on its 10-year capital plan. The inability to execute on our capital plan may result in lost future revenues for CenterPoint Energy. Additionally, these economic conditions may affect customers’ ability to pay their utility bills which may preclude our ability to collect balances due from such customers.\nFurther, the global supply chain has experienced significant disruptions due to a multitude of factors, such as geopolitical and economic uncertainty, regulatory and political instability, import tariffs and trade agreements, labor shortages, resource availability, long lead times, manufacturer production limitations, delivery delays, inflation and severe weather events. These disruptions have adversely impacted the utility industry. Like many of our peers, we have experienced disruptions to our supply chain, as well as increased prices, and may continue to experience such disruptions in the future. For example, President Trump has expressed a desire to impose substantial new or increased tariffs, and in February 2025, imposed tariffs on several countries and certain imports into the United States. These tariffs, as well as any new legislation, tariffs, bans, potential retaliatory trade measures taken against the United States or related governmental action, could increase or cause volatility in the cost of and negatively impact our ability to procure materials, supplies (such as natural gas) or services necessary for our business and capital plan, lead to scarcity of resources and labor necessary for our business and capital plan, further extend lead time or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain and our ability to timely execute our capital plan. To the extent adverse economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, affect our suppliers and customers as well as our ability to meet our capital plan and generation transition plan, including with respect to developing and constructing new generation facilities at the cost and scale and on the timelines that we anticipate, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer. For more information, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. \n51\nFurther, in response to concerns for protecting the environment, we have strived to take a leading stance in the transition to safer and cleaner energy by being the first combined electric and natural gas utility with regulated generation assets to adopt net zero for its Scope 1 and certain Scope 2 emissions by 2035 goals. In addition, we set a Scope 3 emission reduction goal across our multi-state footprint by committing to help our residential and commercial customers reduce GHG emissions attributable to their end use of natural gas by 20% to 30% by 2035 from a 2021 baseline. Our capital plan supports these goals. For more information regarding CenterPoint Energy’s net zero and GHG emissions reduction goals and the risks associated with them, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Affecting Regulatory, Environmental and Legal Risks — CenterPoint Energy is subject to operational and financial risks...”\nSignificant Events \nMay 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl.\n Houston Electric’s service territory experienced sudden and destructive severe weather events in May 2024 that included hurricane-like winds and tornadoes. Subsequently, on July 8, 2024, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in Texas, bringing sustained winds, storm surges and torrential rain into Houston Electric’s service territory. The May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl caused significant damage to Houston Electric’s electric delivery system and resulted in electric service interruptions peaking at an estimated 922,000 customers and more than 2.1 million customers, respectively.\nVarious federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities, such as the Texas Governor’s office, the Texas legislature and the PUCT, have called for or are conducting inquiries and investigations into Hurricane Beryl, the efforts made by Houston Electric to prepare for, and respond to, this event, including the electric service outage issues, and the procurement of TEEEF. Moreover, additional governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities may conduct such inquiries and investigations, as well. On August 12, 2024, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton opened an investigation to evaluate CenterPoint Energy’s conduct during Hurricane Beryl. Texas Lieutenant Governor Patrick has publicly urged the PUCT to hold Houston Electric, rather than ratepayers, responsible for paying $800 million, which was the amount the PUCT had previously approved Houston Electric to recover from ratepayers pursuant to Texas legislation passed after the 2021 Winter Storm Event relating to emergency responsiveness and the leasing of temporary generation units. Additionally, legislation has been proposed in Texas to, among other things, require the PUCT to review TEEEF leased by TDUs, disallow any leases that do not conform to the terms of the proposed legislation (which include, among other things, requirements relating to the speed with which TEEEF may be deployed), disallow recovery of costs associated with such disallowed leases, and implement a process to refund ratepayers the charges paid for the leasing of certain TEEEF. There are significant uncertainties around these inquiries and investigations and potential results and consequences, including with respect to our recovery of costs incurred as a result of Hurricane Beryl and whether any financial penalties will be assessed or changes to Houston Electric’s system, service territories, operations and/or regulatory treatment will result therefrom. Further, on January 22, 2025, a putative shareholder of CenterPoint Energy, Donel Davidson, filed a derivative petition in Harris County District Court, Texas, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment on behalf of CenterPoint Energy against certain of its current and former directors and officers citing, in part, the topics of these inquiries and investigations. The action seeks to recover damages and other relief from the defendants on behalf of CenterPoint Energy. Additionally, on February 12, 2025, a second putative shareholder of CenterPoint Energy made a demand on the Board to investigate the same basic allegations raised in the derivative petition filed by Donel Davidson.\nHouston Electric announced an initial hurricane preparedness and response action plan to the PUCT on July 25, 2024 to enhance the resiliency of the electric system through various investments. Following a meeting with Texas Governor Abbott on August 1, 2024, Houston Electric publicly committed to accelerating its previously announced initial hurricane preparedness and response action plan. Accordingly, Houston Electric announced that it was withdrawing its application for approval of its transmission and distribution system resiliency plan with the PUCT in order to focus on addressing the impacts of Hurricane Beryl in its service territory and accelerating preparedness and resiliency efforts for the remaining storm season, and the withdrawal granted by the PUCT. On August 5, 2024, Houston Electric announced the launch of its GHRI. Subsequently, Houston Electric announced the completion of core resiliency actions as part of the first phase of its GHRI, which included certain vegetation management and pole installation goals. In September 2024, Houston Electric announced the launch of the second phase of its GHRI, which included a series of resiliency plans to install new poles, manage higher-risk vegetation and install certain automated devices prior to the start of the 2025 hurricane season as part of its efforts to strengthen grid resiliency, improve public and customer communications and strengthen local, community and emergency partnerships. Following feedback from customers, external experts and other stakeholders, including elected officials and local agencies, Houston Electric filed the SRP with the PUCT on January 31, 2025, which proposes investing approximately $5.75 billion over a three-year period for transmission and distribution infrastructure, information technology and cybersecurity assets, and event response capability.\n52\nHouston Electric announced on August 28, 2024 its proposal to forego approximately $110 million of profit related to its storm hardening and TEEEF efforts, which would be represented by (1) Houston Electric not seeking to recover approximately $70 million in incremental storm hardening costs incurred in connection with accelerated operational activities after Hurricane Beryl; and (2) Houston Electric not filing, beginning in 2028, for approximately $40 million in anticipated equity profit associated with load-shed orientated TEEEF leased by Houston Electric through the remaining regulatory life of the leases in 2032 as new dispatchable generation is likely to come online in the state of Texas as a result of the Texas Energy Fund. Additionally, on December 19, 2024, Houston Electric announced a proposal to release Houston Electric’s 15 large 27 MW to 32 MW TEEEF units to the San Antonio area prior to the summer of 2025 in an effort to help ERCOT address a potential energy shortfall and Load Shed risk and to provide additional electric generation capacity to support growing energy demand in the greater San Antonio region.\n \nUnder the proposal, Houston Electric would not receive revenue or profit from ERCOT and would also not charge Houston-area customers for these TEEEF units for the period when they are in San Antonio serving ERCOT, which is currently expected to be for a period of up to two years. Houston Electric would anticipate receiving revenues from one or more future transactions after the period the units are utilized to temporarily serve an energy need in the San Antonio area, and would therefore plan to continue to not charge customers for these units for any future periods. As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, Houston Electric estimates that the value of the TEEEF units to be removed from the rate base as a result of the aforementioned proposal will be approximately $375 million. The proposal has not been finalized and is subject to the negotiation of definitive documentation among the relevant parties, as well as being subject to the approval of ERCOT and other stakeholders.  It is not certain that mutually agreeable definitive documentation will be entered into at all or that all approvals will be obtained.\nFor more information, see Note 7, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.\nEquity Transactions. \nOn August 9, 2024, CenterPoint Energy issued 9,754,194 shares of Common Stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of $25.36 per share, for net proceeds of $247 million after deducting issuance costs. For further information, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOn January 10, 2024, CenterPoint Energy entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with certain financial institutions with respect to the offering and sale from time to time of shares of Common Stock, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500 million. Sales of Common Stock may be made by any method permitted by applicable law and deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. CenterPoint Energy may also enter into one or more forward sales agreements pursuant to master forward confirmations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, CenterPoint Energy issued 8,790,848 shares of Common Stock through the ATM Managers under the Equity Distribution Agreement, representing aggregate cash proceeds of $247 million, which was net of compensation paid by CenterPoint Energy to the ATM Managers of $2 million. As of December 31, 2024, CenterPoint Energy had not entered into any forward sale agreements under the at-the-market program. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, CenterPoint Energy had $250 million of remaining capacity available under the program. For further information, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \nAssets Held for Sale.\n \nOn February 19, 2024, CERC Corp. entered into the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement to sell its Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses. The purchase price for the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses is $1.2 billion and subject to adjustment as set forth in the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement, including adjustments based on net working capital, regulatory assets and liabilities and capital expenditures at closing. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2025, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The businesses include approximately 12,000 miles of main pipeline in Louisiana and Mississippi serving more than 300,000 customers. The Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses are reflected in CenterPoint Energy’s Natural Gas reportable segment and CERC’s single reportable segment, as applicable. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRegulatory Proceedings. \nFor further information, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. For information related to our pending and completed regulatory proceedings to date in 2024 and to date in 2025, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources —Regulatory Matters” below.\nDebt Transactions. \nIn 2024, CenterPoint Energy issued or borrowed a combined $4.0 billion in new debt, including Houston Electric’s issuance of $900 million aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds and a $500 million term loan, CERC’s issuance of $400 million principal amount of senior notes, SIGECO’s issuance of $160 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds, and CenterPoint Energy’s issuance of $700 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated notes. During 2024, CenterPoint Energy repaid or redeemed a combined $0.9 billion of debt, including $500 million of its senior notes, $350 million of its floating rate senior notes and $22 million of SIGECO’s first mortgage bonds.

The liquidity and capital requirements of the Registrants are affected primarily by results of operations, capital expenditures, storm restoration costs, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs and various regulatory actions. Capital expenditures (other than expenditures associated with the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl) are expected to be used for investment in infrastructure. These capital expenditures are anticipated to enhance reliability and safety, increase resiliency and expand our systems through value-added projects. Substantial capital expenditures are also expected for restoration costs associated with Hurricane Beryl, as further described below. In addition to dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy’s Common Stock and interest payments on debt, the Registrants’ principal anticipated cash requirements for 2025 include the following:\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\n(in millions)\nEstimated capital expenditures (1) \n$\n4,802 \n$\n2,560 \n$\n1,391 \nEstimated restoration costs associated with May 2024 Storm Events (2)\n34 \n34 \n— \nEstimated restoration costs associated with Hurricane Beryl (2)\n102 \n102 \n— \nScheduled principal payments on Securitization Bonds\n13 \n— \n— \nExpected contributions to pension plans and other postretirement plans\n120 \n1 \n5 \n(1)\nExcludes expenditures for the restoration costs associated with the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl.\n(2)\nRepresents cash requirements associated with estimated storm restoration costs for 2025.\nThe Registrants expect that anticipated cash needs for 2025 will be met with borrowings under their credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, including the issuance of non-recourse securitization bonds at Houston Electric related to costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 due to the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl, anticipated cash flows from operations, and, with respect to CenterPoint Energy and CERC, proceeds from commercial paper and the sale of the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses, if and when completed (the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025). Issuances of debt securities in the capital markets, funds raised in the commercial paper markets, term loans and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available on acceptable terms. The Registrants may, from time to time, redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire their outstanding debt securities through open market purchases, tender offers or pursuant to the terms of such securities.\nFor more information regarding the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl, see Notes 7, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements as well as “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report. \n68\nThe following table sets forth the Registrants’ estimates of the Registrants’ capital expenditures currently planned for projects for 2025 through 2029.

On October 27, 2021, the IURC issued an order approving the CPCN, authorizing Indiana Electric to purchase the Posey Solar project through a BTA to acquire its solar array assets for a fixed purchase price and approved recovery of costs via a levelized rate over the anticipated 35-year life. Due to community feedback and rising project costs caused by inflation and supply chain issues affecting the energy industry, Indiana Electric, along with Arevon, the developer, announced plans in January 2022 to downsize the Posey Solar project to 191 MW. Indiana Electric collaboratively agreed to the scope change, and on February 1, 2023, Indiana Electric entered into an amended and restated BTA that was contingent on further IURC review and approval. On February 7, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a CPCN with the IURC to approve the amended BTA. With the passage of the IRA, Indiana Electric can now pursue PTCs for solar projects. Indiana Electric requested that project costs, net of PTCs, be recovered in rate base rather than a levelized rate, through base rates or the CECA mechanism, depending on which provides more timely recovery. On September 6, 2023, the IURC issued an order approving the CPCN. The Posey Solar project is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2025 and recovered through base rates.\n \nOn July 5, 2022, Indiana Electric entered into a BTA to acquire a 130 MW solar array in Pike County, Indiana through a special purpose entity for a capped purchase price. A CPCN for the project was filed with the IURC on July 29, 2022. On September 21, 2022, an agreement in principle was reached resolving all the issues between Indiana Electric and OUCC. The Stipulation and Settlement agreement was filed on October 6, 2022 and a settlement hearing was held on November 1, 2022.  On January 11, 2023, the IURC issued an order approving the settlement agreement authorizing Indiana Electric to purchase and acquire the Pike County Solar project through a BTA and approved the estimated cost. The IURC also designated the \n70\nproject as a clean energy project under applicable Indiana regulations, approved the proposed levelized rate and associated ratemaking and accounting treatment. Due to inflationary pressures, the developer disclosed that costs exceeded the agreed upon levels in the BTA. After negotiations, Indiana Electric and the developer were not able to agree upon updated pricing. As a result, on March 15, 2024, Indiana Electric provided notice to the IURC that it was exercising its right to terminate the BTA, which terminated all further obligations of Indiana Electric with respect to the project. \nOn January 10, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a CPCN with the IURC to acquire a wind energy generating facility with installed capacity of 200 MWs through a BTA, consistent with its 2019/2020 IRP that calls for up to 300 MWs of wind generation. The wind project is located in MISO’s Central Region. Indiana Electric received approval from the IURC to recover the costs of the wind facility via the CECA mechanism, which the developer believes can be placed in service by the end of 2026. On June 6, 2023, the IURC issued an order approving the CPCN, thereby authorizing Indiana Electric to purchase the wind generating facility. However, as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, Indiana Electric has not entered into any definitive agreement relating to this wind energy generating facility, and it is not certain that a definitive agreement will be entered into at all.\nPPAs\nIndiana Electric also sought approval in February 2021 for a 100 MW solar PPA with Clenera, LLC in Warrick County, Indiana. The request accounted for increased cost of debt related to this PPA, which provides equivalent equity return to offset imputed debt during the 25-year life of the PPA. In October 2021, the IURC approved the Warrick County solar PPA but denied the request to preemptively offset imputed debt in the PPA cost. Due to rising project costs caused by inflation and supply chain issues affecting the energy industry, Clenera, LLC and Indiana Electric were compelled to renegotiate terms of the agreement to increase the PPA price.\n \nOn January 17, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a request with the IURC to amend the previously approved PPA with certain modifications. Revised purchase power costs are requested to be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause proceedings over the term of the amended PPA. On May 30, 2023, the IURC approved the Warrick County solar amended PPA; however, due to MISO interconnection study delays, the developer disclosed the project in-service date would be delayed to 2026.\nOn August 25, 2021, Indiana Electric filed with the IURC seeking approval to purchase 185 MW of solar power, under a 15-year PPA, from \nOriden\n, which is developing a solar project in Vermillion County, Indiana, and 150 MW of solar power, under a 20-year PPA, from Origis, which is developing a solar project in Knox County, Indiana. On May 4, 2022, the IURC issued an order approving Indiana Electric to enter into both PPAs. In March 2022, when the results of the MISO interconnection study were completed, Origis advised Indiana Electric that the costs to construct the solar project in Knox County, Indiana had increased. The increase was largely driven by escalating commodity and supply chain costs impacting manufacturers worldwide. In August 2022, Indiana Electric and Origis entered into an amended PPA, which reiterated the terms contained in the previously approved Knox County solar PPA with certain modifications. On February 22, 2023, the IURC approved the Knox County solar amended PPA; however, due to MISO interconnection delays, the project in-service date will be delayed to 2026. On January 17, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a request with the IURC to amend the previously approved Vermillion County solar PPA with Oriden with certain modifications. Revised purchase power costs were approved to be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause proceedings over the term of the amended PPA with Oriden.  On May 30, 2023, the IURC approved the Vermillion County solar amended PPA; however, due to MISO interconnection study delays, the developer disclosed the project in-service date would be delayed to 2026.\nOn May 1, 2024, Indiana Electric filed with the IURC seeking approval to purchase 147 MW of wind power under a 25-year PPA with an affiliate of NextEra Energy, Inc., which is developing a wind project in Knox County, Illinois. On November 6, 2024, the IURC approved the Knox County wind PPA, which provided for the recovery of the purchase power costs through the fuel adjustment clause proceedings over the term of the PPA. The facility is targeted to be in operation in early 2026.\nNatural Gas Combustion Turbines\nOn June 17, 2021, Indiana Electric filed a CPCN with the IURC seeking approval to construct two natural gas combustion turbines to replace portions of its existing coal-fired generation fleet. On June 28, 2022, the IURC approved the CPCN. The estimated $334 million turbine facility is being constructed at the previous site of the A.B. Brown power plant in Posey County, Indiana and is expected to provide a combined output of 460 MW. Indiana Electric received approval for depreciation expense and post in-service carrying costs to be deferred in a regulatory asset until the date Indiana Electric’s base rates include a return on and recovery of depreciation expense on the facility. A new approximately 23.5 mile pipeline will be constructed and operated by Texas Gas Transmission, LLC to supply natural gas to the turbine facility. FERC granted a certificate to construct the pipeline on October 20, 2022. On January 7, 2025, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the \n71\nFERC’s order granting the certificate.  Indiana Electric granted its contractor a full notice to proceed to construct the turbines on December 9, 2022. The facility is targeted to be operational by mid-year 2025. On February 6, 2025, the EPC contractor for Indiana Electric’s proposed natural gas combustion turbines provided a notice to Indiana Electric that the EPC contractor was identifying the impacts of the proposed tariffs on the project and intended to seek an equitable adjustment to the contract price for the project.  Recovery of the proposed natural gas combustion turbines and regulatory asset was included in the forecasted test year in the Indiana Electric rate case, which was filed with the IURC on December 5, 2023. For more information on the Indiana Electric rate case, see “— Rate Change Applications” below.\nFor more information regarding uncertainties related to our solar projects, see Part I, Item 1A of this combined Form 10-K and “ —Solar Panel Issues” below. \nCulley Unit 3 Operations \nIn June 2022, F.B. Culley Unit 3, an Indiana Electric coal-fired electric generation unit with an installed generating capacity of 270 MW, experienced an operating issue relating to its boiler feed pump turbine. The unit returned to service in March 2023. In testimony filed September 13, 2023, the OUCC and an intervenor that represents industrial customers filed testimony with the IURC alleging that Indiana Electric did not act prudently which led to the unplanned outage and recommended disallowances between $21 million to $27 million. On July 3, 2024, the IURC issued an order finding Indiana Electric acted reasonably and prudently with respect to the events that gave rise to the Culley Unit 3 outage and, in addition, did not approve the intervenors proposed disallowance. The order is now final and non-appealable.\nSpace City Solar Transmission Interconnection Project (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)\nOn December 17, 2020, Houston Electric filed a CCN with the PUCT for approval to build a 345 kV transmission line in Wharton County, Texas connecting the Hillje substation on Houston Electric’s transmission system to the planned 610 MW Space City Solar Generation facility being developed by third-party developer EDF Renewables. In November 2021, the PUCT approved a route that was estimated to cost $25 million and issued a final order on January 12, 2022. There have been project delays due to supply chain constraints in the developer acquiring solar panels. Houston Electric substantially completed construction in the fall of 2023, and the transmission line is expected to be energized shortly after the generation facility is complete, which is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2026.\nKilgore Transmission Project (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric) \nOn August 30, 2023, Houston Electric filed a CCN application with the PUCT for approval to build a 138 kV double circuit transmission line in Chambers County, Texas that will loop the existing 138 kV Chevron to Langston circuit number 86 on Houston Electric’s transmission system to Houston Electric’s planned Kilgore substation. On March 7, the PUCT issued a final order approving a route that was estimated to cost $60 million, including substation costs. The actual capital costs of the project, including the transmission line and the planned Kilgore substation, will depend on actual land acquisition costs, construction costs, and other factors. Completion of construction and energization of the line and substation is anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2026.\nMill Creek\n \nTransmission Project (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric) \nOn November 17, 2023, Houston Electric filed a CCN application with the PUCT for approval to build a 138 kV double circuit transmission line in Harris and Montgomery Counties, Texas that will connect Houston Electric’s transmission system to Houston Electric’s planned Mill Creek substation. On November 21, 2024, the PUCT issued a final order approving a route estimated to cost $68 million. The actual capital costs of the project will depend on actual land acquisition costs, construction costs, and other factors. Completion of construction and energization of the line and substation is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2027.\nTexas Legislation (CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and CERC)\nHouston Electric and CERC were affected by legislation passed in 2023 and associated PUCT rulemaking projects, including the following pieces of legislation that became law during the 88th Texas Legislature, including:\n•\nHouse Bill 1500 became effective on September 1, 2023 and continues the functions of the PUCT, the Office of Public Utility Counsel, and ERCOT through 2029. This bill also includes an amendment that clarifies the use cases under which TDUs may lease and operate temporary generation during “significant” power outages;\n72\n•\nHouse Bill 2263 became effective on June 12, 2023 and authorizes LDCs to offer programs to promote energy conservation and to recover costs prudently incurred to implement such programs under Railroad Commission authority;\n•\nHouse Bill 2555 became effective on June 13, 2023 and allows an electric utility to file a transmission and distribution system resiliency plan with the PUCT and associated cost recovery to enhance its system through hardening, modernization, undergrounding certain lines, lightning mitigation measures, flood mitigation measures, information technology, cybersecurity, physical security, vegetation management and wildfire mitigation. On January 18, 2024, the PUCT issued an Order adopting its Resiliency Plan Rule (16 Tex. Admin. Code § 25.62);\n•\nSenate Bill 947 became effective on September 1, 2023 and creates severe criminal offenses for intentional damage to critical infrastructure facilities that create extended power outages;\n•\nSenate Bill 1015 became effective on June 18, 2023 and allows utilities to file the DCRF twice a year, on any day the PUCT is open (at least 185 days after filing a full base rate proceeding) and setting an administrative approval timeline of 60 days;\n•\nSenate Bill 1016 became effective on May 5, 2023 and requires the PUCT to presume that all employee compensation and benefits are reasonable and necessary when establishing a utility’s rates if based upon market compensation studies issued within the last three years; it includes exceptions for utility officer incentives that are based on financial metrics. Certain incentive compensation that is in-line with market studies will be presumed reasonable and recoverable; and\n•\nSenate Bill 1076 became effective on June 2, 2023 and moves the timeline for the PUCT to approve CCN for transmission projects to 180 days after the date of filing, rather than the first anniversary of the day it was filed. \nThe Registrants will monitor the 89th Texas Legislature for legislation that may impact their businesses.\nMinnesota Legislation (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)\nThe Natural Gas Innovation Act was passed by the Minnesota legislature in June 2021 with bipartisan support. This law establishes a regulatory framework to enable the state’s investor-owned natural gas utilities to provide customers with access to renewable energy resources and innovative technologies, with the goal of reducing GHG emissions and advancing the state’s clean energy future. The maximum allowable cost for an innovation plan will start at 1.75% of the utility's revenue in the state and could increase to 4% by 2033, subject to review and approval by the MPUC. Specifically, the Natural Gas Innovation Act allows a natural gas utility to submit an innovation plan for approval by the MPUC that can propose the use of renewable energy resources and innovative technologies such as:\n•\nrenewable natural gas (produces energy from organic materials such as wastewater, agricultural manure, food waste, agricultural or forest waste);\n•\nrenewable hydrogen gas (produces energy from water through electrolysis with renewable electricity such as solar);\n•\nenergy efficiency measures (avoids energy consumption in excess of the utility’s existing conservation programs); and \n•\ninnovative technologies (reduces or avoids GHG emissions using technologies such as carbon capture).\nOn June 28, 2023, CERC submitted its first innovation plan to the MPUC; the five-year plan includes 18 pilot projects and seven smaller research-and-development projects. These projects will deploy and evaluate a broad array of innovative resources including made-in-Minnesota alternative gases such as renewable natural gas and green hydrogen, as well as pioneering technologies such as a networked geothermal district energy system and end-use carbon capture. The proposed plan requires approval from the MPUC through a review process that is expected to take about one year. The MPUC requested comments by September 15, 2023 if parties believe that the filing is incomplete based on the reporting requirements or if parties do not believe that that the MPUC’s standard informal proceeding process is appropriate. No parties filed comments regarding completeness or raising concerns that the MPUC’s standard informal procedural process is inappropriate. The initial comment period closed on January 15, 2024, the reply comment period closed on March 15, 2024 and the supplemental comment period closed on May 15, 2024. On July 25, 2024, the MPUC voted to approve the plan with some minor modifications during its agenda meeting and a formal order was issued on October 9, 2024.\nSolar Panel Issues (CenterPoint Energy)\nCenterPoint Energy’s current and future solar projects have been impacted by delays and/or increased costs.  The potential delays and inflationary cost pressures communicated from the developers of our solar projects have been primarily due to (i) unavailability of solar panels and other uncertainties related to DOC antidumping and countervailing duties investigation(s), (ii) the December 2021 Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act on solar modules and other products manufactured in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and (iii) persistent general global supply chain and labor availability issues. On May 15, 2024, based on a petition filed by the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, the DOC announced the \n73\ninitiation of antidumping and countervailing duty investigations of silicon photovoltaic cells from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. On October 1, 2024, the DOC’s preliminary countervailing duty determination affirmed the petition and established preliminary duty rates. A final determination is expected in the first quarter of 2025. On November 29, 2024, the DOC announced its preliminary affirmative determination in the antidumping investigation and established preliminary dumping rates. A final determination is expected in the second quarter of 2025. These impacts could result in cost increases for certain projects, and such impacts may require that we seek additional regulatory review and approvals. Additionally, significant changes to project costs and schedules as a result of these factors could impact the viability of the projects. For more information regarding potential delays, cancellations and supply chain disruptions, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors— Risk Factors Affecting Operations — Electric Generation, Transmission and Distribution — Increases in the cost or...” in this report.\nTDSIC 2.0 (CenterPoint Energy)\nOn May 24, 2023, Indiana Electric filed its petition and case-in-chief with the IURC requesting, among other things, approval of its five-year plan for transmission, distribution, and storage improvements (TDSIC Plan) and an order approving the TDSIC Plan was issued on December 27, 2023. The approved five-year TDSIC Plan, covering the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2028, consists of approximately $454 million in proposed investments across seven different programs: (1) Distribution 12kV Circuit Rebuild, (2) Distribution Underground Rebuild, (3) Distribution Automation, (4) Wood Pole Replacement, (5) Transmission Line Rebuild, (6) Substation Rebuild, and (7) Substation Physical Security.\nTransmission and Distribution System Resiliency Plans (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)\nHouse Bill 2555, codified as Tex. Util. Code § 38.078, was passed by the 88th Texas Legislature in 2023 and allows an electric utility to file a transmission and distribution system resiliency plan with the PUCT to enhance the resiliency of the utility’s transmission system through at least one or more of the following measures: hardening, modernization, undergrounding certain lines, lightning mitigation measures, flood mitigation measures, information technology, cybersecurity measures, physical security measures, vegetation management, and wildfire mitigation and response. House Bill 2555 also allows an electric utility to establish a regulatory asset for distribution-related costs, including depreciation expense and carrying costs at the electric utility’s weighted average cost of capital, relating to the implementation of a transmission and distribution system resiliency plan.\nOn April 29, 2024, Houston Electric filed its first transmission and distribution system resiliency plan with the PUCT, which proposed to implement 25 resiliency measures over a three-year period.  On August 1, 2024, Houston Electric announced that it was withdrawing its application for approval of its transmission and distribution system resiliency plan in order to focus on addressing the impacts of Hurricane Beryl and accelerating preparedness and resiliency efforts for the remaining storm season.  The ALJ granted Houston Electric’s request for withdrawal of the transmission and distribution system resiliency plan on August 16, 2024. Following feedback from customers, external experts and other stakeholders, including elected officials and local agencies, Houston Electric filed the SRP with the PUCT on January 31, 2025 for review and approval. Anticipated to benefit Houston Electric customers by saving approximately 1.3 billion customer minutes of interruption, the SRP proposes to invest approximately $5.75 billion over a three-year period from 2026 to 2028 for transmission and distribution infrastructure, information technology and cybersecurity assets and event response capability. This plan proposes 39 resiliency-enhancing measures and a microgrid pilot program to be implemented over the three-year period. The SRP has an estimated capital cost of approximately $5.54 billion and an estimated operations and maintenance expense of approximately $211 million. Approximately $2.17 billion of such cost is for transmission-related investments, and approximately $3.58 billion is for distribution-related investments.\nRate Change Applications \nThe Registrants are routinely involved in rate change applications before state regulatory authorities. Those applications include general rate cases, where the entire cost of service of the utility is assessed and reset. In addition, the Registrants are periodically involved in proceedings to adjust their capital tracking mechanisms (e.g., CSIA, DCRF, DRR, GRIP, TCOS, ECA, CECA and TDSIC), their cost of service adjustments (e.g., RSP and RRA), their decoupling mechanism (e.g., decoupling and SRC), and their energy efficiency cost trackers (e.g., CIP, DSMA, EECR, EECRF, EEFC and EEFR). \n74\nTexas Gas Rate Case. \n On October 30, 2023, CERC filed an application with the Railroad Commission and municipal regulatory authorities to set new natural gas base rates that would be applied consistently across the approximately 1.9 million customers. The need for a rate change was primarily driven by the continuing investment in the safety and reliability of the natural gas system, including new Intelis natural gas meters that feature an integrated safety shutoff valve, changes to depreciation rates that better reflect the actual life and salvage characteristics of assets, and changes in other costs to serve customers. A settlement agreement was filed on April 23, 2024. The settlement agreement was approved by the Railroad Commission on June 25, 2024 and provides for a $5 million annual increase in current revenues and establishes a 9.80% ROE and a 60.61% equity ratio for future GRIP filings.\n \nNew rates became effective in December 2024.\nMinnesota Gas Rate Case. \nOn November 1, 2023, CERC filed an application with the MPUC requesting an adjustment to delivery charges in 2024 and 2025 for the natural gas business in Minnesota.  The requested increase is approximately 6.5% or $85 million for 2024 and an additional approximately 3.7% or $52 million for 2025. The need for a rate change is primarily driven by the continuing investment in the safety and reliability of the natural gas system, including new Intelis natural gas meters that feature an integrated safety shutoff valve, changes to depreciation rates that better reflect the actual life and salvage characteristics of assets, and changes in other costs to serve customers. The request reflects a proposed 10.3% ROE on a 52.5% equity ratio. Interim rates for 2024 of $69 million, subject to refund, were implemented as of January 1, 2024. A request for interim rates of $33 million for  2025 was filed on September 30, 2024,  approved at the December 3, 2024 hearing and approved by an order issued December 20, 2024. A unanimous settlement agreement was filed on November 25, 2024. The settlement provided for an increase of $60.8 million for 2024 and an additional $42.7 million for 2025. The parties agreed to an overall cost of capital of 7.07% for 2024 and 2025. The Administrative Law Judge filed a report on February 13, 2025 recommending the Commission approve the settlement agreement. The anticipated decision date of the rate case is July 1, 2025.\nIndiana Electric Rate Case. \n On December 5, 2023, Indiana Electric filed a petition with the IURC for authority to modify its rates and charges for electric utility service through a phase-in of rates. The requested increase is approximately 16% or $119 million based on a forward looking 2025 test year. The need for a rate increase is primarily driven by the continuing investment in the safety and reliability of the system and normal increases in operating expenses. The initial filing of the rate case reflected a proposed 10.4% ROE on a forecasted 55% equity ratio. Indiana Electric reached a settlement agreement with less than all parties and submitted the agreement to the IURC on May 20, 2024. The settlement reflects a proposed 9.8% ROE on a forecasted 55% equity ratio. The requested increase was lowered to $80 million, an 11% increase. Indiana Electric received a final order on February 3, 2025 approving the settlement with one modification that effectively capped the residential increase to 1.15% of the total increase, allocating the difference to other commercial and industrial customers. The final order approves the 9.8% ROE on a forecasted 55% equity ratio and increases revenues by $80 million.\nHouston Electric Rate Case.\n On March 6, 2024, Houston Electric filed an application with the PUCT requesting authority to change rates and charges for electric transmission and distribution service. The requested increase is approximately $17 million (1%) for retail customers and $43 million (6.6%) for wholesale transmission service, excluding TCRF and rate case expenses. The need for a rate increase is primarily driven by the continuing investment that has been made to support customer growth and to bolster the safety and reliability of Houston Electric’s transmission and distribution system. The request reflects a proposed 10.4% ROE and a 45% equity ratio. Errata testimony was filed to correct minor errors included in the initial filing which reduced the requested increase to $56 million compared to current rates. On January 15, 2025, Houston Electric filed a letter indicating that an agreement in principle had been reached with certain parties and that complete settlement documents would be filed as soon as possible. On January 29, 2025, Houston Electric announced that a settlement agreement was reached with certain parties to the rate case filed on March 6, 2024, including the City of Houston and other regional municipalities. Subject to PUCT review and approval, the settlement is expected to result in approximately $50 million less annual revenue and an average decrease of approximately $1 a month for residential customers based on average usage of 1,000 kWh per month. A proposed order was issued on February 10, 2025. The parties must file corrections or exceptions to the proposed order by February 24, 2025.\nOhio Capital Expenditure Program (CEP). \nOn March 1, 2024, CEOH filed an application with the PUCO for authority to modify its CEP rates and charges. The requested increase is approximately $3 million resulting in a proposed CEP rate for residential customers of $1.54 per month. Per the PUCO’s Opinion and Order in the 2018 general rate case, the CEP rate is capped at $1.50 per month for residential customers. CEOH requested deferral of the 2023 CEP revenue requirement above the CEP rate cap of approximately $155,000. CEOH filed a statement of resolution on July 30, 2024, indicating CEOH and PUCO staff agree to certain statements including: CEOH’s existing deferral authority has not expired and will continue uninterrupted, provided CEOH files its notice of intent for its base rate case prior to the new CEP Rider charges taking effect. PUCO issued a Finding & Order on August 21, 2024, finding that the parties’ resolution of the rate cap and deferral authority issues were reasonable. As discussed below, notice of intent for a base rate case was filed the following week.\n75\nOhio Gas Rate Case\n. On August 27, 2024, CEOH filed a Notice of Intent with PUCO to begin the process of requesting an adjustment in natural gas base rates. CEOH filed its Application and Standard Filing Requirement in October 2024 and the related testimony in November 2024.  The filing seeks a revenue requirement increase of approximately $100 million based on a requested return on equity of 10.4% and equity percentage of 45.87%. The need for a rate increase is primarily driven by the continuing investment in the safety and reliability of the natural gas system. A final order is expected no sooner than the first quarter of 2026.\nThe table below reflects significant applications pending or completed since the Registrants’ combined 2023 Form 10-K was filed with the SEC through the date of the filing of this Form 10-K:\nMechanism\nAnnual Increase (1)\n(in millions)\nFiling\n Date\nEffective Date\nApproval Date\nAdditional Information\nCenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric (PUCT)\nDCRF\n73\nDecember 2023\nApril 2024\nMarch 2024\nBased on the net change in distribution invested capital since its last base rate proceeding of approximately $2.5 billion for the period January 1, 2019 through September 30, 2023, of which $672 million is incremental to the previous DCRF filing, for an incremental revenue increase of $86 million, adjusted for load growth.

Approved rates could differ materially from proposed rates.\n78\nInflation Reduction Act (IRA)\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law.  The law extends or creates tax-related energy incentives for solar, wind and alternative clean energy sources, implements, subject to certain exceptions, a 1% tax on share repurchases after December 31, 2022, and implements a 15% CAMT based on the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations. Corporations are entitled to a CAMT credit to the extent CAMT liability exceeds regular tax liability, which can be carried forward indefinitely and used in future years when regular tax exceeds the CAMT. The Registrants will owe CAMT in excess of their regular tax liability beginning in 2024. As a result, the Registrants may experience a temporary increase in federal cash tax liability due to this provision beginning in 2024. On September 12, 2024, the IRS issued proposed regulations addressing the application of the CAMT. The proposed regulations offer guidance for computing an entity’s adjusted financial statement income, in addition to addressing other provisions of the CAMT. At this time, the Company does not anticipate changes to the applicability of CAMT to the Registrants as a result of the proposed regulations. For more information regarding changes in federal income tax laws and regulations and our related risks, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Affecting Regulatory, Environmental and Legal Risks — We may be significantly affected by changes in federal income tax laws and regulations...” \nGreenhouse Gas Regulation and Compliance (CenterPoint Energy)\nCenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of their operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. Additionally, the Methane Emissions Reduction Program established by the IRA and the new regulations published by the EPA on March 8, 2024 targeting reductions in methane emissions, may increase costs related to production, transmission and storage of natural gas. Houston Electric, in contrast to some electric utilities including Indiana Electric, does not generate electricity, other than TEEEF, and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. Nevertheless, Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within their respective service territories. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or to use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for the Registrants’ services. Further, requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain specified dates in the Registrants’ respective service areas could have a significant impact on CenterPoint Energy and its operations. Further, our third-party suppliers, vendors and partners may also be impacted by climate change laws and regulations, which could impact CenterPoint Energy’s business by, among other things, causing permitting and construction delays, project cancellations or increased project costs passed on to CenterPoint Energy.  Conversely, regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to benefit CenterPoint Energy and CERC and their natural gas-related businesses. At this time, however, we cannot quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to GHG emissions, either positive or negative, on the Registrants’ businesses. Additionally, the Registrants continue to evaluate the impact of the final rules adopted by the SEC on March 6, 2024 regarding disclosure of certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports, for which implementation is subject to ongoing voluntary delay by the SEC, on their respective consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. \nCompliance costs and other effects associated with climate change, reductions in GHG emissions and obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain; nevertheless, any new regulation or legislation relating to climate change will likely result in an increase in compliance costs. CenterPoint Energy will continue to monitor regulatory activity regarding GHG emission standards that may affect its business. Currently, CenterPoint Energy does not purchase carbon credits. In connection with its net zero emissions goals, CenterPoint Energy is expected to purchase carbon credits in the future; however, CenterPoint Energy does not currently expect the number of credits, or cost for those credits, to be material. For more information on greenhouse gas and climate-change regulation and compliance, see “Business—Environmental Matters” in Item 1 of Part I of this report. \nClimate Change Trends and Uncertainties\nAs a result of increased attention regarding climate change, coupled with adverse economic conditions, availability of alternative energy sources, including private solar, microturbines, fuel cells, energy-efficient buildings and energy storage devices, and new regulations restricting emissions, including potential regulations of methane emissions, some consumers and companies may use less energy, meet their own energy needs through alternative energy sources or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for the Registrants’ services. As these technologies likely become more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of the Registrants’ systems and \n79\nservices, which may result in, among other things, Indiana Electric’s generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. Further, evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels have had significant impacts on CenterPoint Energy’s electric generation and natural gas businesses. For example, because Indiana Electric currently relies on coal for a portion of its generation capacity, certain financial institutions choose not to participate in CenterPoint Energy’s financing arrangements.  Conversely, demand for the Registrants’ services may increase as a result of customer changes in response to climate change.  For example, the expected expansion of energy export facilities, including hydrogen facilities, and electrification of industrial processes and transport and logistics, among others, in our service territories could lead to an increase in demand for electricity, resulting in increased usage of CenterPoint Energy’s systems and services. Any negative opinions with respect to CenterPoint Energy’s environmental practices or its ability to meet the challenges posed by climate change formed by regulators, customers, investors, legislators or other stakeholders could harm its reputation.  \nTo address these developments, CenterPoint Energy announced its net zero emission goals for Scope 1 and certain Scope 2 emissions by 2035 and a 20-30% reduction in certain Scope 3 emissions by 2035 as compared to 2021 levels. Indiana Electric’s 2019/2020 IRP identified a preferred portfolio that retires 730 MW of coal-fired generation facilities and replaces these resources with a mix of generating resources composed primarily of renewables, including solar, wind, and solar with storage, supported by dispatchable natural gas combustion turbines including a pipeline to serve such natural gas generation. Indiana Electric continues to execute on its 2019/2020 IRP and has received initial approvals for 626 MWs of the 700-1,000 MWs of solar generation and 200 MWs of the 300 MWs of wind generation identified within Indiana Electric’s 2019/2020 IRP through a combination of BTAs and PPAs. Additionally, as reflected in its 10-year capital plan announced in September 2021, CenterPoint Energy anticipates spending over $3 billion in cleaner energy investments and enablement, which may be used to support, among other things, renewable energy generation. CenterPoint Energy believes its planned investments in renewable energy generation and corresponding planned reduction in its Scope 1 and certain Scope 2 emissions as part of its net zero emissions goals, as well as its planned reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 20-30% by 2035 as compared to 2021 levels, support global efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change. Indiana Electric has conducted a new IRP, which was submitted to the IURC in May 2023, to identify an appropriate generation resource portfolio to satisfy the needs of its customers and comply with environmental regulations. The proposed preferred portfolio is the second evolution to the generation transition plan to move away from coal-fired generation to a more sustainable portfolio of resources. Under the proposed preferred portfolio, Indiana Electric plans to convert its last remaining coal unit to natural gas and to add a significant amount of additional renewable resources through 2033. Indiana Electric has since received approval for 147 MWs of wind generation facilities identified within Indiana Electric’s 2022/2023 IRP through a PPA. For more information regarding CenterPoint Energy’s net zero and GHG emissions reduction goals and the risks associated with them, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Affecting Regulatory, Environmental and Legal Risks — CenterPoint Energy is subject to operational and financial risks...” For more information on Indiana Electric’s IRP and associated risks, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Affecting Regulatory, Environmental and Legal Risks — Indiana Electric’s execution of its generation transition plan...” \nTo the extent climate changes result in warmer temperatures in the Registrants’ service territories, financial results from the Registrants’ businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales. On the other hand, warmer temperatures in CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s electric service territory may increase revenues from transmission and distribution and generation through increased demand for electricity used for cooling. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, microbursts, severe winter weather conditions, including ice storms, wildfires, thunderstorms, high winds, hail, derecho events, or extreme temperatures, including such storms as the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl. Since many of the Registrants’ facilities are located along or near the Texas Gulf Coast, increased or more severe weather events could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers. CenterPoint Energy’s current 10-year capital plan includes capital expenditures to maintain reliability and safety and increase resiliency of its systems as climate change may result in more frequent significant weather events. Houston Electric does not own or operate any electric generation facilities other than, since September 2021, its operation of TEEEF. Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. To the extent adverse weather conditions affect the Registrants’ suppliers, results from their energy delivery businesses may suffer. For example, in Texas, the February 2021 Winter Storm Event caused an electricity generation shortage that was severely disruptive to Houston Electric’s service territory and the wholesale generation market and also caused a reduction in available natural gas capacity. Additionally, the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl caused significant damage to Houston Electric’s electric delivery system and resulted in electric service interruptions peaking at an estimated 922,000 customers and more than 2.1 million customers, respectively. When the Registrants cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers, or customers cannot receive services, the Registrants’ financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and they generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent the Registrants are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services, the Registrants’ future financial results may be adversely impacted. Further, as the \n80\nintensity and frequency of significant weather events continues, it may impact our ability to secure cost-efficient insurance. For more information regarding risks relating to climate change and other weather and natural disaster impacts, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Affecting Regulatory, Environmental and Legal Risks — Climate change and other weather and natural disaster impacts could...” \nOther Matters\nCredit Facilities \nThe Registrants may draw on their respective revolving credit facilities from time to time to provide funds used for general corporate and limited liability company purposes, including to backstop CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s commercial paper programs. The facilities may also be utilized to obtain letters of credit. For further details related to the Registrants’ revolving credit facilities, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nBased on the consolidated debt to capitalization covenant in the Registrants’ revolving credit facilities, the Registrants would have been permitted to utilize the full capacity of such revolving credit facilities, which aggregated approximately $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2024. \nAs of February 10, 2025, the Registrants had the following revolving credit facilities and utilization of such facilities:\nAmount Utilized as of February 10, 2025\nRegistrant\nSize of Facility\nLoans\nLetters of Credit\nCommercial Paper\nWeighted Average Interest Rate\nTermination Date \n(in millions)\nCenterPoint Energy \n$\n2,400 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n737 \n4.50%\nDecember 6, 2028\nCenterPoint Energy (1)\n250 \n— \n— \n— \n—%\nDecember 6, 2028\nHouston Electric\n300 \n— \n— \n— \n—%\nDecember 6, 2028\nCERC\n1,050 \n— \n— \n497 \n4.51%\nDecember 6, 2028\nTotal \n$\n4,000 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n1,234 \n(1)\nThis credit facility was issued by SIGECO.\nBorrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions. However, there is no requirement that the borrower makes representations prior to borrowing as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we consider customary. The revolving credit facilities also provide for customary fees, including commitment fees, administrative agent fees, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. In each of the revolving credit facilities, the spread to SOFR and the commitment fees fluctuate based on the borrower’s credit rating. Each of the Registrant’s credit facilities provide for a mechanism to replace SOFR with possible alternative benchmarks upon certain benchmark replacement events. The borrowers are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants in the four revolving credit facilities.\nDebt Transactions\nFor detailed information about the Registrants’ debt transactions in 2024, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nSecurities Registered with the SEC\nOn May 17, 2023, the Registrants filed a joint shelf registration statement with the SEC registering indeterminate principal amounts of Houston Electric’s general mortgage bonds, CERC Corp.’s senior debt securities and CenterPoint Energy’s senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of shares of Common Stock, shares of preferred stock, depositary shares, as well as stock purchase contracts and equity units. The joint shelf registration statement will expire on May 17, 2026.

The Registrants note that these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Registrants’ securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants’ credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on the Registrants’ ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of the Registrants’ commercial strategies.\nA decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under the Registrants’ revolving credit facilities. If the Registrants’ credit ratings had been downgraded one notch by S&P and Moody’s from the ratings that existed as of December 31, 2024, the impact on the borrowing costs under the four revolving credit facilities would have been insignificant. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact the Registrants’ ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market.  Additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas reportable segments.\nPipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper’s guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both Moody’s and S&P, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months’ charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, \n82\nCERC might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $159 million as of December 31, 2024. The amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels.\nZENS and Securities Related to ZENS (CenterPoint Energy)\nIf CenterPoint Energy’s creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS holders thought CenterPoint Energy’s liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, some ZENS holders might decide to exchange their ZENS for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns or from other sources. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and shares of ZENS-Related Securities would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged or otherwise retired and shares of ZENS-Related Securities are sold. The ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement or exchange of the ZENS. If all ZENS had been exchanged for cash on December 31, 2024, deferred taxes of approximately $802 million would have been payable in 2024. If all the ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on December 31, 2024, capital gains taxes of approximately $84 million would have been payable in 2024 based on 2024 tax rates in effect. For additional information about ZENS, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCross Defaults\nUnder the Registrants’ respective revolving credit facilities and any term loan agreements (in each case, other than SIGECO), a payment default on, or a non-payment default, event or condition that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding $125 million by the borrower or any of their respective significant subsidiaries will cause a default under such borrower’s respective credit facility or term loan agreement. Under SIGECO’s revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default, event or condition that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specific types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding $75 million by SIGECO or any of its significant subsidiaries will cause a default under SIGECO’s credit facility. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under its subsidiaries’ debt instruments or revolving credit facilities.\nPossible Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint Ventures\nFrom time to time, the Registrants consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures, strategic initiatives or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any determination to take action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. The Registrants may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to the Registrants at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions. CenterPoint Energy has increased its planned capital expenditures in its Electric and Natural Gas businesses multiple times over the recent years to support rate base growth and may continue to do so in the future. The Registrants may continue to explore asset sales as a means to efficiently finance a portion of their increased capital expenditures in the future, subject to the considerations listed above. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOn February 19, 2024, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement to sell its Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. For further information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCollection of Receivables from REPs (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)\nHouston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers. Before conducting business, a REP must register with the PUCT and must meet certain financial qualifications. Nevertheless, adverse economic conditions, weather events, such as the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis, and any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows. In the event of a REP’s default, Houston Electric’s tariff provides a number of remedies, \n83\nincluding the option for Houston Electric to request that the PUCT suspend or revoke the certification of the REP. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. However, Houston Electric remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to the replacement REP or the provider of last resort. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made against Houston Electric involving payments it had received from such REP. If a REP were to file for bankruptcy, Houston Electric may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such REP that are unpaid as of the date the REP filed for bankruptcy. However, PUCT regulations authorize utilities, such as Houston Electric, to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in future rate cases, subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity. \nOther Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements\nIn addition to the above factors, the Registrants’ liquidity and capital resources could also be negatively affected by:\n•\ncash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including weather hedging arrangements, and natural gas purchases, natural gas price and natural gas storage activities of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas reportable segment; \n•\nacceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased natural gas prices, and concentration of natural gas suppliers (CenterPoint Energy and CERC); \n•\nincreased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas (CenterPoint Energy and CERC); \n•\nincreases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities or term loans or the use of alternative sources of financings, including financings due to the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl; \n•\nvarious legislative or regulatory actions, including such actions in response to the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl; \n•\nincremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives (CenterPoint Energy); \n•\nthe ability of REPs, including REP affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., to satisfy their obligations to CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric; \n•\nslower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher natural gas prices, changing economic conditions, public health threats or severe weather events, such as the May 2024 Storm Events and Hurricane Beryl (CenterPoint Energy and CERC); \n•\nthe satisfaction of any obligations pursuant to guarantees;\n•\nthe outcome of litigation, including litigation related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and Hurricane Beryl;\n•\ncontributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans;\n•\nrecovery of any losses under applicable insurance policies; \n•\nrestoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes or other severe weather events and the timing of and amounts sought for recovery of such restoration costs; and\n•\nvarious other risks identified in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report. \nCertain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money\n Certain provisions in certain note purchase agreements relating to debt issued by CERC have the effect of restricting the amount of secured debt issued by CERC and debt issued by subsidiaries of CERC Corp. Additionally, Houston Electric and SIGECO are limited in the amount of mortgage bonds they can issue by the General Mortgage and SIGECO’s mortgage indenture, respectively. For information about the total debt to capitalization financial covenants in the Registrants’ and SIGECO’s revolving credit facilities, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the Registrants’ financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on the Registrants’ financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. The Registrants base their estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Registrants’ operating environment changes. Our management believes the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates \n84\nhave been reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors. For a complete discussion of the Registrants’ significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting for Rate Regulation\nAccounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. CenterPoint Energy, for its Electric and Natural Gas reportable segments, Houston Electric and CERC apply this accounting guidance. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates. Determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. If events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, the Registrants would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities. For further detail on the Registrants’ regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill\nThe Registrants review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually, goodwill is tested for impairment as required by accounting guidance for goodwill.  Unforeseen events, changes in market conditions, and probable regulatory disallowances, where applicable, could have a material effect on the value of long-lived assets, including goodwill, future cash flows, interest rate, and regulatory matters, and could result in an impairment charge. The Registrants recorded no impairments to long-lived assets, including goodwill during 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nFair value is the amount at which an asset, liability or business could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.\nFair value measurements require significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. Determining the discount rates for the businesses that are not rate-regulated, such as for Energy Systems Group prior to the sale in June 2023, requires the estimation of the appropriate company-specific risk premiums for such businesses based on evaluation of industry and entity-specific risks, which includes expectations about future market or economic conditions existing on the date of the impairment test. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on results of the impairment tests. \nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Test\nCenterPoint Energy and CERC completed their 2024 annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2024 and determined, based on a qualitative assessment, that no goodwill impairment charge was required for any reporting unit. No qualitative factors were present that indicated impairment of CenterPoint Energy or CERC reporting units.\nAlthough no goodwill impairment resulted from the 2024 annual test, an interim goodwill impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, if CenterPoint Energy’s market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time, or events affecting a reporting unit such as a contemplated disposal of all or part of a reporting unit.\nAssets Held for Sale\nGenerally, a long-lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the Board of Directors, as applicable, commits to a plan to sell, and a sale is expected to be completed within one year. The Registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale, or the disposal group, at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell.\n \nIf the disposal group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, \n85\nthe goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. Goodwill is not allocated to a portion of a reporting unit that does not meet the definition of a business.\n \nAs described further in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, certain assets and liabilities of the Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDC businesses met the held for sale criteria and the goodwill attributable to these businesses as of December 31, 2024 was $217 million and $122 million for CenterPoint Energy and CERC, respectively.\nAccounting for Securitization of Coal Generation Facility Retirements\nAccounting guidance for rate regulated long-lived asset abandonment requires that the carrying value of an operating asset or an asset under construction is removed from property, plant and equipment when it becomes probable that the asset will be abandoned. The Registrants recognize a loss on abandonment when they conclude it is probable the cost will not be recovered in future rates. When the Registrants conclude it is probable that costs will be recovered in future rates, a regulatory asset is recognized. The portion of property, plant and equipment that will remain used and useful until abandonment and recovered through depreciation expense in rates will continue to be classified as property, plant and equipment until the asset is abandoned. The Registrants evaluate if an adjustment to the estimated life of the asset and, accordingly, the rate of depreciation, is required to recover the asset while it is still providing service. Determining probability of abandonment or probability of recovery requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. \nIn connection with the securitization financing of qualified costs in the second quarter of 2023 associated with the completed retirement of SIGECO’s A.B. Brown coal generation facilities, CenterPoint Energy evaluated the VIE consisting of the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity, for possible consolidation, including review of qualitative factors such as  the power to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE. CenterPoint Energy has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE and is most closely associated with the VIE as compared to other interests held by the holders of the SIGECO Securitization Bonds. CenterPoint Energy is, therefore, considered the primary beneficiary and consolidated the VIE.\nFor purposes of reporting cash flows, the Registrants consider cash equivalents to be short-term, highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents held by the SIGECO Securitization Subsidiary solely to support servicing the SIGECO Securitization Bonds as of December 31, 2024 are reflected on CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn connection with the issuance of the SIGECO Securitization Bonds, CenterPoint Energy was required to establish a restricted cash account to collateralize the SIGECO Securitization Bonds that were issued in the financing transaction. The restricted cash account is not available for withdrawal until the maturity of the SIGECO Securitization Bonds and is not included in cash and cash equivalents.\nUnbilled Revenues\nRevenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through AMS meter communications or manual readings. At the end of each month, deliveries to non-AMS customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Information regarding deliveries to AMS customers after the last billing is obtained from actual AMS meter usage data. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual AMS meter data, daily supply volumes and applicable rates. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nCenterPoint Energy sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. CenterPoint Energy uses several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to its plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected \n86\nreturn on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, CenterPoint Energy’s actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and other retirement plans expense recorded. Read “— Other Significant Matters — Pension Plans” for further discussion.\n \nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 2(q) to the consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect the Registrants.\nOTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS\nPension Plans (CenterPoint Energy).\n  As discussed in Note 8(b) to the consolidated financial statements, CenterPoint Energy maintains non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plans are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under ERISA and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes.\n \nUnder the terms of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans, it reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. CenterPoint Energy’s funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA.\n \nAdditionally, CenterPoint Energy maintains unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plans which allow participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under the non-contributory qualified pension plan except for federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. \nCenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements and employer contributions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\nCenterPoint Energy\n(in millions)\nMinimum funding requirements for qualified pension plans\n$\n23 \n$\n— \n$\n— \nEmployer contributions to the qualified pension plans\n23 \n24 \n27 \nEmployer contributions to the non-qualified pension plans\n7 \n8 \n8 \nCenterPoint Energy expects to make contributions of approximately $105 million and $7 million to the qualified and non-qualified pension plans in 2025, respectively.\nChanges in pension obligations and plan assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants.\n \nAs the sponsor of a plan, CenterPoint Energy is required to (a) recognize on its Consolidated Balance Sheet an asset for the plan’s over-funded status or a liability for the plan’s under-funded status, (b) measure a plan’s assets and obligations as of the end of the fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of the plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and, when related to its rate-regulated utilities with recoverability of cost, to regulatory assets.\nThe projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impacts resulting from increases in discount rates were offset by the changes in demographic and expected versus actual returns on assets. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans by $345 million. Changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during \n87\na year could materially, positively or negatively, change the funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions at the next remeasurement.\n \nHouston Electric and CERC participate in CenterPoint Energy’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans covering substantially all employees. Pension cost by Registrant was as follows for the periods presented: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\nCenterPoint Energy\nHouston Electric\nCERC\n(in millions)\nPension cost \n$\n51 \n$\n23 \n$\n18 \n$\n53 \n$\n27 \n$\n19 \n$\n172 \n$\n59 \n$\n88 \nThe calculation of pension cost and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, CenterPoint Energy’s qualified pension plans had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00%, which is 50 basis points higher than the 6.50% rate assumed as of December 31, 2023. The expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of our plans and the expected return for each asset class. CenterPoint Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 5.60%, which is 65 basis points higher than the 4.95% discount rate assumed as of December 31, 2023 attributed primarily to rising interest rates. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of CenterPoint Energy’s plans.\n \nCenterPoint Energy’s actuarially determined pension and other postemployment cost for 2024 and 2023 that is greater or less than the amounts being recovered through rates in the majority of Texas jurisdictions is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, respectively.  Pension cost for 2025, including the non-qualified benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $49 million before applicable regulatory deferrals and capitalization, based on an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% and a discount rate of 5.60% as of December 31, 2024. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 50 basis points from 7.00% to 6.50%, the 2025 pension cost would increase by approximately $6 million.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the pension plans projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded non-qualified pension plans, exceeded plan assets by $345 million.  If the discount rate were lowered by 50 basis points from 5.60% to 5.10%, CenterPoint Energy’s projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately $60 million and its 2025 pension cost would decrease by approximately $2 million. The expected reduction in pension cost due to the decrease in discount rate is a result of the expected correlation between the reduced interest rate and appreciation of fixed income assets in pension plans with significantly more fixed income instruments than equity instruments. In addition, the assumption change would impact CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of December 31, 2024 by $54 million and would result in an incremental charge to comprehensive income in 2024 of $5 million, net of tax of $1 million, due to the increase in the projected benefit obligation. \nFuture changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plans will impact CenterPoint Energy’s future pension expense and liabilities. CenterPoint Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.",
