MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through two distribution channels: NIKE Direct operations which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\") and to wholesale accounts, which include a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in nearly all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories. \nOur strategy is to achieve sustainable, profitable long-term revenue growth by leading with sport, creating innovative, \"must-have\" products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.\nQUARTERLY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS \n•\nNIKE, Inc. Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 were $11.7 billion compared to $11.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n•\nNIKE Direct revenues were $4.5 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to $4.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, primarily driven by a decrease in traffic in NIKE Brand Digital. NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 40% of total NIKE Brand revenues. \n•\nNIKE Brand wholesale revenues were $6.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 compared to $6.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, primarily driven by an increase in units, partially offset by an increase in discounts.\n•\nGross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 decreased 320 basis points to 42.2% due to higher discounts with our wholesale partners, higher discounts in our NIKE Brand factory stores, an increase in product costs including new tariffs and changes in channel mix.\n•\nInventories as of August 31, 2025, were $8.1 billion, an increase of 8% compared to May 31, 2025, primarily driven by product mix and an increase in units.\n•\nWe returned approximately $0.7 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 through dividends and share repurchases.\nFACTORS IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS\nWe are navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty and volatility in the operating environment, including, but not limited to, geopolitical dynamics, tax regulation, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and evolving tariff policies. As a result of new tariffs, we expect a gross incremental cost of approximately $1.5 billion on an annualized basis. We are taking actions to mitigate the impact of new tariffs; however for fiscal 2026, we expect a negative impact on gross margin. We will continue to monitor changes to the import and export policies of the U.S. and other countries that could require us to change the way in which we do business. These factors, and any changes to these factors, among others, could have a material adverse impact on consumer behavior and on our future Revenues and overall profitability. For a discussion of these factors and other risks, refer to Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part 1 within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025 (the \"Annual Report\").\nDespite these factors, we are focused on driving distinction within key sports, building a complete product portfolio, creating stories to inspire and emotionally connect with consumers, and elevating and growing the entire marketplace as we continue to take actions across the following areas:\n•\nProduct Management:\n \nReducing the supply of certain footwear products in the marketplace as we shift to new and innovative products and rebalance the mix of our footwear portfolio.\n•\nMarketplace Management:\n \nRepositioning NIKE Brand Digital as a full-price platform and reinvesting in wholesale distribution. This includes liquidating inventory through increased markdowns across NIKE Direct, and higher sales returns and discounts with our wholesale partners to reduce inventory and create capacity for new product. We are also making investments to elevate the presentation of our brands in physical retail. \n•\nBrand Management:\n Increasing investment in demand creation, including brand marketing and sports marketing, to support key product launches and sports moments.\n19\nTable of Contents\nOur reportable operating segments are at different stages of progress against these actions and therefore, the timing of financial impacts have varied and we expect will continue to vary by segment. These actions have had, and in the future will have, a negative impact on our Revenues and overall profitability. However, we believe these actions will reignite brand momentum and reposition our business to drive long-term shareholder value.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThroughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). References to these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. \nEarnings Before Interest and Taxes (\"EBIT\"):\n Calculated as Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Total NIKE, Inc. EBIT for the three months ended August 31, 2025 and August 31, 2024 are as follows:\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\nNet income\n$\n727 \n$\n1,051 \nAdd: Interest expense (income), net\n(18)\n(43)\nAdd: Income tax expense\n195 \n256 \nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES\n$\n904 \n$\n1,264 \nEBIT margin:\n Calculated as total NIKE, Inc.

Currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period in place of the exchange rates in use during the current period. \nCOMPARABLE STORE SALES\nComparable store sales:\n This key metric, which excludes NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales represents a performance metric that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies.\n20\n \nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31,\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\n2025\n2024\n% CHANGE\nRevenues\n$\n11,720 \n$\n11,589 \n1 \n%\nCost of sales\n6,777 \n6,332 \n7 \n%\nGross profit\n4,943 \n5,257 \n-6 \n%\nGross margin\n42.2 \n%\n45.4 \n%\nDemand creation expense\n1,188 \n1,226 \n-3 \n%\nOperating overhead expense\n2,828 \n2,822 \n0 \n%\nTotal selling and administrative expense\n4,016 \n4,048 \n-1 \n%\n% of revenues\n34.3 \n%\n34.9 \n%\nInterest expense (income), net\n(18)\n(43)\n— \nOther (income) expense, net\n23 \n(55)\n— \nIncome before income taxes\n922 \n1,307 \n-29 \n%\nIncome tax expense\n195 \n256 \n-24 \n%\nEffective tax rate\n21.1 \n%\n19.6 \n%\nNET INCOME\n$\n727\n \n$\n1,051\n \n-31\n \n%\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n0.49 \n$\n0.70 \n-30 \n%\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS\nREVENUES\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\n% CHANGE\n% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES\n(1)\nNIKE, Inc.

Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 were $11.7 billion compared to $11.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues decreased 1%, primarily due to lower revenues in Greater China and Converse, which reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 2 and 1 percentage points, respectively. Higher revenues in North America increased NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 2 percentage points.\n•\nNIKE Brand revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and were flat on a currency-neutral basis.\n•\nNIKE Brand footwear revenues decreased 2% on a currency-neutral basis. Unit sales of footwear increased 2%, while lower average selling price (\"ASP\") per pair reduced footwear revenues by approximately 4 percentage points. Lower ASP per pair was primarily due to channel mix and higher discounts.\n•\nNIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Unit sales of apparel increased 10%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 3 percentage points. Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to higher discounts and channel mix, partially offset by product mix.\n•\nNIKE Brand wholesale revenues increased 7% on a reported basis and 5% on a currency-neutral basis. The increase on a currency-neutral basis was driven by higher revenues in North America, Europe, Middle East & Africa (\"EMEA\") and Asia Pacific & Latin America (\"APLA\"), partially offset by a decrease in Greater China.\n•\nNIKE Direct revenues were $4.5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, compared to $4.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues decreased 5% due to declines in NIKE Brand Digital sales of 12% from $2.3 billion in first quarter of fiscal 2025 to $2.0 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and declines in NIKE stores sales of 1%. Comparable store sales decreased 1%.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Demand creation expense by approximately 2 percentage points.\nOperating overhead expense was flat due to higher wage-related expense and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, offset by lower other administrative costs.

Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.\nOur foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of and for the three months ended August 31, 2025, there have been no material changes to our hedging program or strategy from what was disclosed within our Annual Report.\nRefer to Note 3 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 7 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end. For additional information about our Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations within our Annual Report.\nTRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\n•\nProduct Costs — Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity and factory input costs from the foreign currency adjustments program with certain factories.\n•\nNon-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\n•\nOther Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\n•\nNon-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nMANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\nCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized within Other (income) expense, net within our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability being hedged. \n31\nTable of Contents\nTRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' equity. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a benefit of approximately $213 million for the three months ended August 31, 2025. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our\n \nIncome before income taxes was a benefit of approximately $54 million for the three months ended August 31, 2025.\nMANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\nTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments and to mitigate exposure to forecasted future cash flows of certain intercompany transactions. The combination of these foreign currency exposures and the related hedging instruments has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings. These hedges are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges.\nWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact of approximately $17 million on our Income before income taxes for the three months ended August 31, 2025.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCASH FLOW ACTIVITY\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2025\n2024\n$ CHANGE\nCash provided (used by):\nOperations\n$\n222 \n$\n394 \n$\n(172)\nInvesting activities\n(59)\n(166)\n107 \nFinancing activities\n(598)\n(1,622)\n1,024 \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and equivalents\n(5)\n19 \n(24)\nNET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n$\n(440)\n$\n(1,375)\n$\n935\n \nCash provided by operations decreased $172 million. This was driven by a decrease of $239 million in Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in certain working capital components and other assets and liabilities, which increased $67 million. The change in working capital was primarily impacted by favorable changes to Accounts receivable and Inventories. This was in part due to the timing of wholesale shipments as well as a larger increase in inventory units in the prior period. These changes were partially offset by changes to Accounts payable, due to the timing of payments.\nCash used by investing activities decreased $107 million, primarily driven by the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases).\nCash used by financing activities decreased $1,024 million, primarily driven by lower share repurchases. \nDuring the first three months of fiscal 2026, we purchased a total of 1.8 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $123 million (an average price of $68.20 per share) under the four-year, $18 billion share repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in June 2022. As of August 31, 2025, we have repurchased 124.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $12.1 billion (an average price of $97.57 per share) under this $18 billion share repurchase program. During the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we continued to moderate and ultimately stopped repurchases under our existing share repurchase program due to lower operating cash flows in the current year. The existing program remains authorized by the Board of Directors and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time, depending upon market conditions, our liquidity and capital needs and other factors. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash.\n32\n \nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nOn July 17, 2025, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf\") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 17, 2028.\nAs of August 31, 2025, our committed credit facilities were unchanged from the information previously reported within our Annual Report. We currently have long-term debt ratings of A+ and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. Any changes to these ratings could result in interest rate and facility fee changes. As of August 31, 2025, we were in full compliance with the covenants under our facilities and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of the covenants in the foreseeable future. As of August 31, 2025 and May 31, 2025, no amounts were outstanding under our committed credit facilities.\nLiquidity is also provided by our $3 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the three months ended August 31, 2025, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our $3 billion program. We may issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs.\nTo date, in fiscal 2026, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the capital or credit markets; however, future volatility may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.\nAs of August 31, 2025, we had Cash and equivalents and Short-term investments totaling $8.6 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major banks, money market funds, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of August 31, 2025, the weighted average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 106 days.\nWe believe that existing Cash and equivalents, Short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\nThere have been no significant changes to the material cash requirements previously reported.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of August 31, 2025, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n33\nTable of Contents\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. \nWe believe the assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting estimates described in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section within the Annual Report have the greatest potential impact on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from these estimates. Within the context of these critical accounting estimates, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.\n34\n \nTable of Contents"
