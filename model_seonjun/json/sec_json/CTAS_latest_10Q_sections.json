This strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include market segments to which we have not historically served. We will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers.\nTo pursue the strategy of increasing penetration, we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis. This frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships. The combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services.\nWe pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in several ways. Cintas has a national sales organization introducing all its products and services to prospects in all market segments. Our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. We also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion. Finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.\n  \nResults of Operations\nCintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an All Other category. Cintas’ two reportable operating segments are Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services, as well as workplace water services. The remainder of Cintas’ business, which consists of the Fire Protection Services operating segment and the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment, is included in All Other. These operating segments consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and operating income. Revenue and operating income for the three months ended August 31, 2025 and 2024, for the two reportable operating segments and All Other are presented in \nNote 10\n entitled Segment Information of “Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.” The Company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker (CODM) regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate.\nConsolidated Results\nThree Months Ended August 31, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended August 31, 2024\n \nTotal revenue increased 8.7% to $2,718.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to $2,501.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for \n17\nTable of Contents\nthe impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.8%. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.9% due to acquisitions. \nUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue was $2,091.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to $1,933.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, which was an increase of 8.1%. The organic revenue growth rate for this reportable operating segment was 7.3%. Revenue growth in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment was positively impacted by 0.8% due to acquisitions. Revenue growth was a result of new business, the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and price increases, partially offset by lost business. \nOther revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 10.4% for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024, from $567.7 million to $627.1 million. The organic revenue growth rate for other revenue was 9.6%. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.8% due to acquisitions.\nCost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in-service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $71.4 million, or 7.3%, for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024. Cost of uniform rental and facility services improved as a percent of revenue, decreasing from 50.7% for the three months ended August 31, 2024, to 50.3% for the three months ended August 31, 2025. This improvement as a percent of revenue was primarily due to more efficient usage of in-service inventory and strategic sourcing initiatives. \nCost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, personal protective equipment, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased $30.7 million, or 11.4%, for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024. Cost of other increased as a percent of revenue, increasing from 47.3% for three months ended August 31, 2024, to 47.7% for the three months ended August 31, 2025. The increase in cost of sales as a percent of revenue was primarily due to adding route capacity.\nSelling and administrative expenses increased $57.6 million, or 8.3%, in the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 27.5% for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to 27.6% for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The change as a percent of revenue is primarily due to operating leverage from revenue growth.\nOperating income was $617.9 million, or 22.7% of revenue, for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to $561.0 million, or 22.4% of revenue, for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The resulting increase in operating income as a percent of revenue was primarily due to more efficient in-service inventory usage and operating leverage from revenue growth.\nNet interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $22.0 million for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to $24.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The change was primarily due to a decrease in the average amount of outstanding debt during the three months ended August 31, 2025.\nCintas’ effective tax rate was 17.6% and 15.8% for the three months ended August 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The effective tax rate in both periods was impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. \nNet income was $491.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2025, an increase of 8.7% compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024. Diluted earnings per share were $1.20 for the three months ended August 31, 2025, which was an increase of 9.1% compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024. Diluted earnings per share increased primarily due to the increase in net income. \n18\nTable of Contents\nUniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating Segment\nThree Months Ended August 31, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended August 31, 2024\n \nUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased to $2,091.1 million from $1,933.8 million, or 8.1%, for the three months ended August 31, 2025, over the three months ended August 31, 2024. The organic revenue growth rate for the reportable operating segment was 7.3%. The cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $71.4 million, or 7.3%. The reportable operating segment’s gross margin was $1,038.5 million. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 49.7% for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to 49.3% for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The resulting increase as a percent of revenue was primarily due to more efficient usage of in-service inventory and strategic sourcing initiatives. \nSelling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased $32.3 million in the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2025 were 25.8%, compared to 26.2% in the three months ended August 31, 2024. The improvement was primarily due to operating leverage from revenue growth and a decrease in employee-partner related expenses as a percent of revenue.\nIncome before income taxes increased $53.5 million, or 12.0%, for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024. Income before income taxes was 23.9% of the reportable operating segment's revenue compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024 of 23.1% of revenue. The improvement in income before income taxes was a result of the expansion in gross margin in addition to the improvement in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue noted above.\nFirst Aid and Safety Services Reportable Operating Segment\nThree Months Ended August 31, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended August 31, 2024\nFirst Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue increased from $292.6 million to $334.7 million, or 14.4%, for the three months ended August 31, 2025, over the three months ended August 31, 2024. The organic revenue growth rate for the reportable operating segment was 14.1%. First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue was positively impacted by 0.3% due to acquisitions. The increase in revenue was driven by many factors including increases in new business sold by sales representatives, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers, price increases and strong customer retention. \nCost of first aid and safety services for the three months ended August 31, 2025, increased $20.7 million, or 16.7%, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024. The gross margin as a percent of revenue was 56.8% for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to the gross margin as a percent of revenue of 57.7% in the three months ended August 31, 2024. The reduction in gross margin as a percent of revenue was primarily due to adding route capacity.\n \nSelling and administrative expenses increased $12.3 million in the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2025 were 32.8%, compared to 33.3% for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The improvement was primarily due to operating leverage from revenue growth and a decrease in employee-partner related expenses as a percent of revenue.\nIncome before income taxes for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased $9.0 million to $80.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024. Income before income taxes was 24.0% of the reportable operating segment’s revenue compared to the three months ended August 31, 2024 of 24.4%. The change in income before income taxes as a percent to revenue was primarily due to the previously discussed change in gross margin, partially offset by the improvement in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue noted above.\n19\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following is a summary of our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents as of and for the three months ended August 31:\n(In thousands)\n2025\n2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n414,481 \n$\n460,357 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(116,227)\n$\n(109,480)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(424,001)\n$\n(591,269)\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period\n$\n138,143 \n$\n101,373 \nCash and cash equivalents as of August 31, 2025 and 2024, include $66.7 million and $51.0 million, respectively, that is located outside of the U.S. \nCash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of long-term debt. \nWe expect our cash flows from operating activities to remain sufficient to provide us with adequate levels of liquidity. In addition, we have access to $2.0 billion of debt capacity from our amended and restated revolving credit facility. We believe the Company has sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. Acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividends remain strategic objectives, but they will be dependent on the economic outlook and liquidity of the Company.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $414.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2025, compared to $460.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. The change from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital, specifically, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. These changes were partially offset by an increase in net income and favorable changes in working capital, specifically accounts receivable, net and prepaid expenses.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures, purchases of investments and cash paid for acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures were $102.0 million and $92.9 million for the three months ended August 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Capital expenditures in the three months ended August 31, 2025, included $70.5 million for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment and $16.5 million for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. Cash paid for acquisitions of businesses was $7.6 million and $9.4 million for the three months ended August 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The acquisitions during both the three months ended August 31, 2025 and 2024, occurred in our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection Services operating segment, which is included in All Other. Net cash used in investing activities also includes $6.5 million and $7.1 million of purchases of investments during the three months ended August 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n \nNet cash used in financing activities was $424.0 million and $591.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The improvement in cash used in financing activities was due to a decrease in share buyback activity, which was partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the net issuance of commercial paper and an increase in dividends paid in the three months ended August 31, 2025. \n20\nTable of Contents\nOn July 26, 2022 and July 23, 2024, Cintas announced that the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized share buyback programs, each for $1.0 billion. Neither of the outstanding share buyback programs have an expiration date.

This completed the July 26, 2022 share buyback program and included purchases under the July 23, 2024 share buyback program. From the inception of the July 26, 2022 share buyback program through September 2025, Cintas purchased 5.4 million shares of Cintas common stock in the aggregate, at an average price of $185.01 per share, for a total purchase price of $1.0 billion.

The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility of up to $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is March 23, 2027. As of August 31, 2025 and May 31, 2025, there was no commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. \nCintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented. \nOur access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future based on our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past and Cintas expects to access such markets from time to time in the future to fund its cash requirements, including the repayment of short-term and/or long-term obligations. Our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of August 31, 2025, our ratings were as follows:\nRating Agency\nOutlook\nCommercial\nPaper\nLong-term\n Debt\nStandard & Poor’s\nStable\nA-2\nA-\nMoody’s Investors Service\nStable\nP-2\nA3\nIn the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.\nTo monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, long-term debt and standby letters of credit. \n22\nTable of Contents\nFinancial and Nonfinancial Disclosure About Issuers and Guarantors of Cintas’ Senior Notes\nCintas Corporation No. 2 (Corp. 2) is the indirectly, wholly owned principal operating subsidiary of Cintas.
