We are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on value while serving neighborhoods locally through our large worldwide network of franchise owners and U.S. Company-owned stores through both the delivery and carryout service models. We have been selling quality, affordable food to our customers since 1960. We became “Domino’s Pizza” in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967. Over more than 60 years, we have built Domino’s into one of the most widely-recognized consumer brands in the world. We believe our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 99% of Domino’s global stores owned and operated by our independent franchisees as of December 29, 2024. Franchising enables an individual to be a business owner and maintain control over all employment-related matters and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of the Domino’s global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us.\n\n\n \n\n\nDomino’s business model is straightforward: Domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. We also have a global agreement with Uber Technologies, Inc. to allow customers to order Domino’s products through their marketplace. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees.\n\n\n \n\n\nDomino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees. Royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the Domino’s\n®\n brand marks. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food and other products to franchisees through our supply chain operations primarily in the U.S. and Canada and by operating a number of Company-owned stores in the U.S. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza\n®\n brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and other products to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit from the franchise model, including the end consumer, who can purchase Domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically.\n\n\n \n\n\nDomino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flows to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, through an asset-light model. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Domino’s financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchised and Company-owned stores. Changes in retail sales are primarily driven by same store sales growth and net store growth. We actively monitor both of these metrics, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. Retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as Company-owned store and supply chain revenues.\n\n\n \n\n\nAt Domino’s, we believe we have a proven business model for success that has historically driven strong returns for our shareholders. Our Hungry for MORE strategy aims to generate MORE sales, MORE stores and MORE profits. The strategic imperatives of our Hungry for MORE strategy are as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\nMost Delicious Food: \nWe believe we have the best pizza in the industry, and our menu has even more mouthwatering options beyond pizza. We will continue to showcase the breadth of our menu, while highlighting the deliciousness of our food through our innovative marketing promotions.\n\n\n \n\n\nOperational Excellence: \nWe are relentless in our focus on convenience, consistency and efficiency for our customers.\n\n\n \n\n\nRenowned Value:\n We are committed to continuing to offer competitive pricing and personalized value for our customers that is innovative and memorable.\n\n\n \n\n\nEnhanced by Best-in-Class Franchisees:\n Our franchisees play a vital role in driving results and excitement across the more than 90 markets in which we operate.\n \n\n\n \n4\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Industry\n\n\n \n\n\nThe U.S. QSR pizza category is large and fragmented. From 2019 through 2024, the U.S. QSR pizza category has grown from $37.6 billion to $42.1 billion. It is the second-largest category, by sales, within the $358.4 billion U.S. QSR sector. The U.S. QSR pizza category is primarily comprised of delivery, dine-in and carryout, with carryout and delivery comprising the two largest segments.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the U.S., we compete in the delivery and carryout segments of the pizza industry, and we are the dollar market share leader for delivery and carryout among pizza QSRs. Delivery segment dollars of $16.9 billion in 2024 (up from $13.9 billion in 2019) account for approximately 40% of total U.S. consumer spend at pizza QSRs. The four industry leaders, including Domino’s, account for approximately 60% of U.S. pizza delivery, based on reported consumer spending, with the remaining dollars going to regional chains and independent or local establishments. From 2019 to 2024, the carryout segment grew from $17.3 billion to $20.5 billion. The four industry leaders, including Domino’s, account for approximately 52% of the U.S. carryout segment. (Source: Circana, CREST, year ending December 2024).\n\n\n \n\n\nIn contrast to the U.S., international pizza delivery is relatively underdeveloped, with only Domino’s and two other competitors having a significant global presence. We believe that demand for pizza delivery and pizza carryout is large and growing globally, driven by international consumers’ increasing emphasis on convenience, and is supported by our proven success of more than 40 years of conducting business abroad.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Competition\n\n\n \n\n\nThe global pizza delivery and carryout segments, as well as the broader QSR sector, are highly competitive. In the U.S., we compete against regional and independent or local companies as well as national chains Pizza Hut\n®\n, Papa John’s\n®\n and Little Caesars Pizza\n®\n. Internationally, we compete primarily with Pizza Hut, Papa John’s and country-specific national, regional and local pizzerias. We generally compete on the basis of product quality, location, image, service, technology, convenience and price. Our business and those of our competitors can be affected by changes in consumer tastes, economic conditions, demographic trends, geopolitical and reputational considerations, marketing, advertising, pricing and consumers’ disposable income. We also compete with other restaurants, as well as order and delivery aggregation companies, which have continued to grow in size and scale in recent years. We compete not only for customers, but also for management and hourly employees, including store team members, drivers and qualified franchisees, as well as suitable real estate sites.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Customers\n\n\n \n\n\nOur business is not dependent upon a single retail customer or small group of customers, including franchisees. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues in 2024, 2023 or 2022. As of December 29, 2024, our largest franchisee based on store count, Domino’s Pizza Enterprises (DMP: ASX), operated 3,741 stores in 12 international markets, which accounted for approximately 26% of our international store count and 18% of our global store count. Revenues from this master franchisee accounted for 1.5% of our consolidated revenues in 2024. Our international franchise segment only requires a modest amount of general and administrative expenses to support its markets and does not have a cost of sales component. Therefore, the vast majority of these royalty revenues result in profits to us.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Menu\n\n\n \n\n\nWe offer a menu designed to present delicious, quality offerings to customers, while keeping it simple enough to minimize operational complexity and expedite order-taking and food preparation. Our basic menu features pizza products with varying sizes and crust types. Our typical store also offers side items including bread products, wings, boneless chicken, pastas, oven-baked sandwiches, dips, soft drink products and desserts. During 2024, we launched our newest menu items in the U.S., 5-Cheese Mac & Cheese and New York Style Pizza. International market offerings vary by country and culture, such as the French Burgundy-flavored Beef Pizza commemorating the Paris 2024 Olympics or Paratha Pizza offerings in India including three unique flavors of Corn & Cheese, Paneer or Chicken Keema.\n\n\n \n5\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStore Image and Operations\n\n\n \n\n\nWe operate two distinct service models within our stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. In the U.S., delivery and carryout generally contribute evenly to our overall system transaction count. The majority of our U.S. and international stores are constructed in the carryout-friendly Pizza Theater design. Many of these stores offer casual seating and enable customers to watch the preparation of their orders, but in the U.S. and many international markets, do not offer a full-service dine-in experience. As a result, our stores generally do not require expensive restaurant facilities and staffing.\n\n\nOur Business Segments\n\n\n \n\n\nWe operate, and report, three business segments: U.S. stores, international franchise and supply chain.\n\n\n \n\n\nU.S. Stores\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring 2024, our U.S. stores segment accounted for $1.54 billion, or 33%, of our consolidated revenues. Our U.S. stores segment is comprised primarily of our franchise operations, which consisted of 6,722 franchised stores located in the U.S. as of December 29, 2024. We also operated a network of 292 U.S. Company-owned stores as of December 29, 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\nDirectly operating Domino’s stores contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor. We also use our Company-owned stores as test sites for technological innovation and promotions, as well as operational improvements. Additionally, we also use them for training new store managers and operations team members, as well as developing prospective franchisees. While we are primarily a franchised business, we continuously evaluate our mix of U.S. Company-owned and franchised stores. As of December 29, 2024, franchised stores represented approximately 96% of our total store count within our U.S. stores segment.\n\n\n \n\n\nU.S. Franchise Profile\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 29, 2024, our network of 6,722 U.S. franchise stores was owned and operated by 751 independent U.S. franchisees. Our franchise formula enables franchisees to benefit from our brand recognition with a relatively low initial capital investment. As of December 29, 2024, the average U.S. franchisee owned and operated approximately nine stores and had been in our franchise system for over 15 years. Additionally, 22 of our U.S. franchisees operated more than 50 stores (including our largest U.S. franchisee who operated 158 stores) and 223 of our U.S. franchisees each operated one store as of December 29, 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe apply rigorous standards to prospective U.S. franchisees. We generally require them to manage a store for at least one year and graduate from our franchise management school program before being granted the right to franchise. This enables us to observe the operational and financial performance of a potential franchisee prior to entering into a long-term agreement. Substantially all of our independent U.S. franchise owners started their careers with us as delivery drivers or in other in-store positions, which we believe offers advantages in terms of familiarity with our business and store operations. In addition, we generally restrict the ability of U.S. franchisees to be involved in other businesses, which we believe helps focus our franchisees’ attention on operating their stores. We believe these characteristics and standards are largely unique within the franchise industry and have resulted in qualified and focused franchisees operating Domino’s stores. We maintain a productive relationship with our independent franchise owners through regional franchise teams, distributing materials that help franchise stores comply with our standards and using franchise advisory groups that facilitate communications between us and our franchisees. We consider our relationship with our U.S. franchisees to be good.\n\n\n \n\n\nU.S. Franchise Agreements\n\n\n \n\n\nWe enter into franchise agreements with U.S. franchisees under which the franchisee is generally granted the right to operate a store in a particular location for a term of ten years, with an ability to renew for an additional term of ten years. We had a franchise agreement renewal rate of approximately 99% in 2024. Under the current standard franchise agreement, we assign an exclusive area of primary responsibility to each franchised store. Each franchisee is generally required to pay a 5.5% royalty fee on sales, as well as certain technology fees. In certain instances, we will collect lower rates based on certain incentives.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n6\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur stores in the U.S. generally contribute 6.0% of their sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns (subject, in certain instances, to lower rates based on certain incentives and waivers). Contributions by our U.S. franchisees to the Domino’s National Advertising Fund Inc. (“DNAF”), the Company’s consolidated not-for-profit advertising subsidiary, are primarily used to purchase media for advertising, and also to support market research, field communications, public relations, commercial production, talent payments and other activities to promote the Domino’s brand. In addition to the national and market-level advertising contributions, U.S. stores generally spend additional funds on local store marketing activities.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe have the contractual right, subject to state law, to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a franchisee’s failure to adhere to the Company’s franchise agreement, failure to make required payments or failure to adhere to specified Company policies and standards.\n\n\nInternational Franchise\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring 2024, our international franchise segment accounted for $318.7 million, or 7%, of our consolidated revenues. This segment is comprised of a network of franchised stores in over 90 international markets. As of December 29, 2024, we had 14,352 international franchised stores. The principal sources of revenues from those operations are royalty payments generated by retail sales from franchised stores, as well as certain technology fees.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur international franchisees employ our basic standard operating model and adapt it to satisfy the local eating habits and consumer preferences of various regions outside the U.S. Currently, the vast majority of our international stores operate under master franchise agreements. We believe that Domino’s appeals to potential international franchisees because of our recognized brand name and technological leadership, the moderate capital expenditures required to open and operate the stores and the system’s desirable store-level profitability. Stores in eight of our ten largest international markets in terms of store count are operated by master franchise companies that are publicly traded on stock exchanges as noted in the below table.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe following table shows our store count as of December 29, 2024 in our ten largest international markets, which accounted for approximately 65% of our international stores as of that date.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket\n\n\n \n\n\nNumber of stores\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia (JUBLFOOD: NS)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,136\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited Kingdom (DOM: L)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,299\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina (1405: HK)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,011\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico (ALSEA: MX)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n961\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan (DMP: ASX)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n943\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia (DMP: ASX)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n742\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkey (JUBLFOOD: NS)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n728\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n620\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n484\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance (DMP: ASX)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n462\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInternational Franchisee Profile\n\n\n \n\n\nThe vast majority of our markets outside of the U.S. are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries. In a few select markets, we franchise directly to individual store operators. Prospective master franchisees are required to possess local market knowledge to establish and develop Domino’s stores, with the ability to identify and access targeted real estate sites, as well as expertise in local laws, customs, culture and consumer behavior. We also seek candidates that have access to sufficient capital to meet growth and development plans. We consider our relationship with our international franchisees to be good.\n\n\n \n\n\nInternational Master Franchise and Other Agreements\n\n\n \n\n\nOur international master franchise agreements generally grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop and sub-franchise stores, and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic areas. Agreements are generally for a term of ten years, with options to renew for additional terms. The agreements typically contain growth clauses requiring franchisees to open a minimum number of stores within a specified period. The master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial, one-time franchise fee as well as an additional franchise fee upon the opening of each new store. The master franchisee is also required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of sales, which varies among international markets and may also differ based on certain incentives and concessions and averaged approximately 3.0% in 2024. We also have agreements with certain of our international master franchisees with respect to certain technology fees.\n\n\n \n7\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSupply Chain\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring 2024, our supply chain segment accounted for $2.85 billion, or 60%, of our consolidated revenues. In the U.S., we operate 22 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers, two thin crust manufacturing facilities and one vegetable processing center. We also operate five regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in Canada. We plan to continue investing in supply chain productivity initiatives in the future. Our supply chain segment leases a fleet of more than 1,000 tractors and trailers. Our centers produce fresh dough and purchase, receive, store and deliver quality food and other complementary items to substantially all of our U.S. stores and most of our Canadian franchised stores. We regularly supply over 7,600 stores with various food and other products.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe believe our franchisees voluntarily choose to obtain food and other products from us because we offer the most efficient, convenient and cost-effective alternative, while also offering both quality and consistency. Our supply chain segment offers profit-sharing arrangements to U.S. and Canadian franchisees who purchase all of their food for their stores from our centers. These profit-sharing arrangements generally offer participating franchisees and Company-owned stores with 50% of the pre-tax profit from our supply chain center operations. We believe these arrangements strengthen our ties to and provide aligned benefits with franchisees.\n\n\n \n\n\nThird-Party Suppliers\n\n\n \n\n\nA significant amount of our annual food spend is with suppliers with whom we maintain long-standing partnerships. Our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety. We review and evaluate these partners’ quality assurance programs through (among other actions) on-site visits, third-party audits and product evaluations designed to ensure compliance with our standards. We believe the length and quality of our relationships with third-party suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices.\n\n\n \n\n\nCheese is our largest food cost. The price we charge to our U.S. franchisees for cheese is formula-based, with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange cheddar block price as the primary component, plus a supply chain markup. As cheese prices fluctuate, our revenues and margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate; however, actual supply chain dollar margins remain unchanged. We currently purchase our U.S. pizza cheese from a single supplier. Under our December 2024 agreement which expires in December 2029, our U.S. supplier agreed to provide the Company with an uninterrupted supply of cheese and the Company agreed to purchase substantially all of its U.S. pizza cheese from this supplier during the five-year term of the contract. The majority of our meat toppings in the U.S. come from a single supplier under a contract that expires at the end of December 2025. We have the right to terminate these arrangements for quality failures and for certain uncured breaches. We have entered into a multi-year agreement with Coca-Cola\n®\n. This contract, renegotiated in December 2023, provides for Coca-Cola to continue to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on December 31, 2030 or at such time as a minimum number of cases of Coca-Cola products are purchased by Domino’s, whichever occurs later.\n\n\n \n\n\nAdditionally, in 2024, we transitioned the operations of our equipment and supplies distribution center and entered into a new agreement to allow substantially all our U.S. stores and certain international stores to procure equipment and supplies directly from a third-party supplier. We do not believe this transition will have a material impact on our gross margins or income from operations.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe believe alternative third-party suppliers are available for all of these referenced products. While we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our supply partners, we do not believe such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our business. We continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have not experienced any significant shortages of supplies or delays in receiving our inventories or products. Prices charged to us by our supply partners are subject to fluctuation, and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and savings on to stores. We periodically enter into supplier contracts to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices. We do not engage in speculative transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n8\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Strengths\n\n\n \n\n\nStrong Brand Equity\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are the largest pizza company in the world, and we believe our Domino’s brand is one of the most widely-recognized consumer brands in the world. We are the recognized world leader in pizza delivery, and, in the U.S., we are also the market share leader in carryout. We believe consumers associate our brand with quality, affordable food and with technological innovations and extensive advertising through innovative marketing promotions.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are the number one pizza company in the U.S. with approximately 23% market share at pizza QSRs, based on consumer spending data for the year ending December 2024. Within the pizza QSR segment, we are number one in delivery with approximately 32% share of delivery dollars, and we are also leading in carryout with approximately 19% share of carryout/drive-thru QSR pizza consumer spending (Source: Circana, CREST). With 7,014 stores located in the U.S., our store delivery areas cover a majority of U.S. households. Our share position and scale allow us to leverage our purchasing power, supply chain strength and marketing investments. We believe our scale and market coverage allow us to effectively serve our customers’ demands for convenience and timely delivery. Outside the U.S., we have significant market share positions in many of the markets in which we compete.\n\n\nStrong and Proven Business Model\n\n\n \n\n\nOur business model generates U.S. and international franchise royalties and fees, supply chain revenues and retail sales at Company-owned stores. We have developed this model over our many years of operation, and it is anchored by strong store-level economics, which provide an entrepreneurial incentive for our franchisees and historically has generated strong demand for new stores. Over the past ten years, estimated average U.S. store profitability in the Domino’s system has increased meaningfully, resulting in higher profitability for our franchise owners. Our franchise system, in turn, has produced strong and consistent earnings for us through royalty and fee payments and through supply chain gross margins.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn the U.S., we have developed a cost-efficient store model, characterized by a delivery and carryout-oriented store design, with moderate capital requirements and a menu of quality, value-oriented and affordable items. At the store level, we believe the simplicity and efficiency of our operations give us significant advantages over our competitors, who, in many cases, also focus on dine-in or have broader menu offerings. At the supply chain level, we believe we provide quality, good value and consistency for our franchise customers while also driving profits for us, which we share with our franchisees under the profit-sharing arrangements described above.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur menu simplifies and streamlines production and delivery processes and maximizes economies of scale on purchases of our principal food items. In addition, our stores are generally smaller and less expensive to build, furnish and maintain as compared to many other restaurant concepts, and they create a positive experience for our carryout customers. The combination of this efficient store model and strong sales volume has resulted in strong store-level economics and, we believe, makes Domino’s an attractive business opportunity for existing and prospective franchisees around the world. We and our franchisees are continuing to focus on growing our global store count. In recent years, we have focused specifically on increasing our presence in our existing markets to provide better service to our customers, including condensing our delivery areas to provide better delivery service and adding locations that are closer to our carryout customers. We call this approach our “fortressing” strategy.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe believe our store financial returns have led to a strong, well-diversified franchise system. This established franchise system has produced strong cash flows and earnings for us, enabling us to invest in the Domino’s brand, stores, technology and supply chain centers, pay dividends, repurchase and retire shares of our common stock and service our debt obligations.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n9\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTechnological Innovation\n\n\n \n\n\nTechnological innovation is vital to our brand and our long-term success, and technology is critical to competing in the global pizza and broader QSR industries. In the U.S., Domino’s generated more than 85% of U.S. retail sales in 2024 from digital channels, and our emphasis on technological innovation has allowed us to develop many innovative ordering platforms. In 2024, the Company completed the redesign of its e-commerce platforms and intends to roll them out across the U.S. system in 2025.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur simple to understand and easy to use Domino’s Rewards\n® \nloyalty program provides members reward points for qualifying orders. When rewards members accumulate a certain amount of points, Domino’s Rewards offers loyalty members the opportunity to redeem points for a wide selection of our menu items.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Domino’s Operating System (“DOM OS”) is the combination of tools, processes and technologies that work together to optimize and orchestrate operations at our stores, including the flow of orders. The foundation of DOM OS is our proprietary point-of-sale system called Domino’s PULSE\n™\n. Our Domino’s PULSE system is designed to drive operating efficiencies for our franchisees and our corporate management and assist franchisees in independently managing their business. We believe our integrated technology solutions throughout our system provide us with competitive advantages over other concepts.\n\n\n \n\n\nProduct Innovation\n\n\n \n\n\nWe believe our core hand-tossed pizza recipe has contributed to long-term growth in customer reorder rates, consumer traffic and increased sales in the U.S. This recipe is now in use in other markets around the world. Our more than 60 years of innovation have resulted in numerous new product developments. Product innovation is also present in our global markets, where our master franchisees have the ability to recommend products to suit their local market tastes.\n\n\n \n\n\nInternal Dough Manufacturing and Supply Chain System\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition to generating significant revenues and earnings in the U.S. and Canada, we believe our vertically integrated dough manufacturing and supply chain system enhances the quality and consistency of our products, strengthens our relationships with franchisees and leverages economies of scale to offer lower costs to our stores. It also allows store managers to focus on store operations and customer service by relieving them of the responsibility of mixing dough in the stores and sourcing other ingredients. Many of our international master franchisees also profit from running supply chain businesses in their respective markets.\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman Capital\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 29, 2024, we had approximately 10,700 employees, including approximately 6,500 employees supporting our U.S. Company-owned stores and U.S. franchise operations (our U.S. stores segment), approximately 3,100 employees supporting our U.S. and Canadian supply chain operations (our supply chain segment), approximately 100 employees supporting our international franchise operations (our international franchise segment) and approximately 1,000 corporate employees. Approximately 4,300 of our employees are part-time and approximately 6,400 are full-time equivalent. Our franchisees are independent business owners, so their employees are not our employees and therefore are not included in our employee count. As of December 29, 2024, none of our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.\n\n\nPurpose and Values\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are a purpose-inspired and performance-driven company with exceptional people committed to feeding the power of possible, one pizza at a time. At the heart of our brand is a commitment to a set of values that define our core beliefs on how we run our business, treat our people, support our franchisees and serve our customers.\n\n\n \n\n\nDo the Right Thing:\n We act with integrity and make disciplined decisions, even when it’s difficult or unpopular. High ethical standards and uncommon honesty are at the heart of how we work together. We are committed to safely and responsibly serving our customers, and to giving back to the communities where we live and work.\n\n\n \n\n\nPut People First:\n We create an inclusive culture, knowing our people are core to our success. We treat each other with dignity and respect, and we value the differences each team member brings. We strive to be a company where all team members can bring their full selves to work and know that they can belong, contribute and reach their potential.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n10\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCreate Inspired Solutions:\n We are a company built on entrepreneurship and innovation. We get better every day by having the humility and the courage to embrace and lead change. Together, we unlock our collective potential to be bold and think big. We have a bias for action to solve customer needs in new and relevant ways.\n\n\n \n\n\nChampion our Customers:\n We deliver on our promises, treating each order and interaction as an opportunity to deepen relationships by delivering great products, services and experiences. We hold ourselves accountable, and if we don’t deliver on a promise, we are committed to making it right.\n\n\n \n\n\nGrow and Win Together:\n We are not playing a finite game. We are committed to building an enduring brand that outlives any of our individual contributions. We will grow together, deliver exceptional results together, celebrate wins together, have fun together, and leave the Domino’s brand in a better place for those that come after.\n\n\n \n\n\nCompensation and Benefits\n\n\n \n\n\nExceptional people are the core of our business. We are committed to providing competitive pay and benefits to attract and retain great talent, whether in our U.S. Company-owned stores, in our supply chain centers or in our corporate offices. We enable this by benchmarking and analyzing pay and benefits and we are committed to pay equity for all employees.\n\n\n \n\n\nDomino’s offers a comprehensive benefits package to eligible team members, including several benefits designed to promote an inclusive workplace like paid parental leaves, adoption support, discounted childcare tuition, and health plans that are available to dependents, spouses and domestic partners and include fertility support. We also offer eligible team members a 401(k) plan, education assistance, access to financial education, a back-up childcare network and access to legal assistance.\n\n\n \n\n\nBeyond basic insurance programs, Domino’s offers other wellness services to help team members participating in our health plan manage and optimize their health. These no-cost programs include smoking cessation, diabetes and hypertension management, at-home physical therapy for such team members, in addition to emotional support through Domino’s team member assistance program for all part-time and full-time team members and their dependents. Additionally, we provide up to 40 hours per year of sick time for all part-time and full-time team members, with no waiting period for our part-time team members who begin accruing sick pay on their first day of hire, and access to an outside wellness platform featuring thousands of videos on topics like mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, sleep, and financial well-being.\n\n\n \n\n\nTalent Development and Recruiting\n\n\n \n\n\nHaving best-in-class talent across the globe is crucial to all aspects of Domino’s business, brand and long-term success. We are focused on attracting, developing and retaining high-performing teams and building an inclusive culture that inspires leadership, encourages innovative thinking and supports the development and advancement of all team members. Domino’s team members are empowered to drive their own success through different resources, training and several development programs.\n\n\n \n\n\nOur success will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores, dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations. To continue to strengthen our ability to attract and retain talent to ensure we have appropriate staffing to operate our stores and supply chain centers, we have launched an applicant tracking system and have made continued investments in frontline team member wage rates in our U.S. Company-owned stores and supply chain centers. On an annual basis, we also review scores for our team member engagement surveys to identify strengths and opportunities for our brand.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe opportunity and potential at Domino’s is best represented in a key statistic: substantially all of our U.S. franchisees started as delivery drivers or in other in-store positions. With the vast majority of Domino’s U.S. franchisees developed from within our own system, the opportunity to become a small business owner is a profound and unique aspect of Domino’s culture and strength as a brand. Experienced store managers and other operators can apply for Franchise Management School (“FMS”). At FMS, these operators receive training for a successful transition from store management to store ownership.\n\n\nEmpowering People Efforts\n\n\n \n\n\nOur mission, rooted in our values, to ‘\nfeed the power of possible, one pizza at a time,\n’ starts with our people. Domino’s team members have a passion for innovation and learning, a commitment to our core values and to delivering the joy of pizza worldwide. We believe that fostering a sense of belonging for everyone promotes a culture where anything is possible. That is why we are committed to building an environment that welcomes, seeks to understand and values everyone’s contribution. We are made better together.\n\n\n \n11\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTeam Member Engagement\n\n\n \n\n\nDomino’s is committed to fostering an engaged culture in the workplace where people are respected and appreciated, and where team members listen, learn, and support each other. We define team member engagement as the strength of the connection team members feel toward the work they do, their teams and the overall organization. Every year our aim is to proactively and continuously listen to our team members’ sentiment around their work, direct manager, teams, culture, and overall commitment to the brand. Through deep analyses and leader-led listening sessions, we strive to validate our efforts and commit ourselves to making year-over-year improvement as we propel Domino’s to be a workplace of choice.\n\n\n \n\n\nBusiness Resource Groups\n\n\n \n\n\nOne of the ways we engage our team members is through our business resource groups (“BRGs”), which are open to all team members regardless of demographics. Our BRGs hold company-wide fireside chats featuring inclusive topics and speakers, provide best practice sharing, and help team members enhance professional skills and nurture meaningful work connections. Our five BRGs serve as trusted advisors to functional business groups while continuing to foster a culture of belonging, inclusion and allyship.\n\n\n \n\n\nCorporate Stewardship\n\n\n \n\n\nOur vision for stewardship is for Domino’s to deliver the power of possible every day for the communities we serve, our people and the planet. We drafted our stewardship vision, with notable goals and objectives to drive change in the years and decades to come, and with pillars that ladder up to that vision and our underlying long-term goals. We have continued our efforts to better understand our environmental and social impacts.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe engaged outside experts to measure and quantify our environmental footprint, and identify opportunities to improve. With the help of these experts, we have conducted a materiality assessment, connected with key stakeholders inside and outside the company and developed a baseline report for our carbon, water and land use footprint in the U.S. We have established significant commitments on greenhouse gas emissions and in October 2024 our near-term and net zero targets were approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We have established a commitment to achieve our near-term targets by 2032 and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We also continue to highlight important stewardship topics with consumers, including our recent efforts to promote the ability to recycle pizza boxes throughout the U.S. We also launched a fleet of electric vehicles as part of an initiative to solve a business need with a solution that is also good for the planet.\n\n\n \n\n\nDomino’s also has a long history of caring for the communities we serve. Our national philanthropic partner is St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital\n®\n, which is internationally recognized for its pioneering work in finding cures and saving children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases. Through a variety of internal and consumer-based activities, including a national consumer fundraising campaign called St. Jude Thanks and Giving\n®\n, the Domino’s system has contributed approximately $143 million to St. Jude since our partnership began in 2004, including raising approximately $18 million in 2024. Included in that effort was Domino’s 10-year, $100 million commitment to raise funds to build the Domino’s Village at St. Jude, a housing complex that accommodates up to 140 patient families during long-term stays at the hospital, which opened in 2023. During 2024, we announced a campaign to raise a cumulative $300 million for St. Jude by 2034, the 30\nth\n anniversary of our partnership.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe also support the Domino’s Pizza Partners Foundation (the “Partners Foundation”). Founded in 1986, the mission of the Partners Foundation is “Team Members Helping Team Members.” Primarily funded by team member and franchise contributions, the Partners Foundation is a separate, not-for-profit organization that has disbursed nearly $14 million over the past five years. The Partners Foundation is committed to meeting the needs of Domino’s team members facing crisis situations, such as fire, illness, natural disasters or other personal tragedies.\n\n\n \n\n\nYou can find more information about our initiatives and read our 2024 Corporate Stewardship Report, which includes both Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indexed tables, at \nstewardship.dominos.com\n. The information included in our Corporate Stewardship Report is not incorporated by reference herein and should not be considered a part of this document.\n\n\n \n12\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdditional Disclosures\n\n\n \n\n\nWorking Capital\n\n\n \n\n\nInformation about the Company’s working capital is included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7.\n\n\n \n\n\nGovernment Regulation\n\n\n \n\n\nWe, along with our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the operation of our business. Each store is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the store is located. In connection with maintaining our stores, we may be required to expend funds to meet certain federal, state and local regulations, including regulations requiring that remodeled or altered stores be accessible to persons with disabilities. Difficulties in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store in a particular area or cause an existing store to cease operations. Our supply chain facilities are also licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal, state and local health and fire codes.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. Labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our store personnel and certain supply chain personnel. A significant number of both our and our franchisees’ food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage, and past increases in the minimum wage have increased labor costs, as would future increases.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees, and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities. We are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on our experience and the net worth of our subsidiary, Domino’s Pizza Franchising LLC. We believe our franchise disclosure document, together with any applicable state versions or supplements, and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises.\n\n\n \n\n\nInternationally, our franchise stores are subject to national and local laws and regulations that are often similar to those affecting our U.S. stores, including laws and regulations concerning franchises, advertising, labor, health, sanitation and safety. Our international stores are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities, equipment and other products, and laws regulating foreign investment. We believe our international disclosure statements, franchise offering documents and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with the laws of the foreign countries in which we have offered franchises.\n\n\n \n\n\nPrivacy and Data Protection\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations both in the U.S. and globally. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increase in attention given to privacy and data protection issues with the potential to directly affect our business. This includes recently-enacted laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally requiring notification to individuals and government authorities of security breaches involving certain categories of personal information. Any changes in privacy or data protection laws or regulations could also impact our marketing techniques and could change our marketing strategies. We have a privacy policy posted on our website at \ndominos.com\n. The security of our financial data, customer information and other personal information is a priority for us.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n13\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrademarks\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have many registered trademarks and believe that the Domino’s mark and Domino’s Pizza names and logos, in particular, have significant value and are important to our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of our trademarks and to vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our trademarks. We license the use of our registered marks to franchisees through franchise agreements.\n\n\n \n\n\nEnvironmental Matters\n\n\n \n\n\nWe are not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that we would expect to materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations. During 2024, there were no material environmental compliance-related capital expenditures, and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2025.\n\n\n \n\n\nAvailable Information\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Company makes available, free of charge, through its internet website \nir.dominos.com\n, its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a), 15(d), or 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such material with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
