  "item1": "Item 1.  BUSINESS\nGeneral Development of Business\nHormel Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation (collectively, the \"Company\", \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\"), was founded by George A. Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota, as Geo. A. Hormel & Company. The Company started as a processor of meat and food products and continues in this line of business with emphasis on the manufacturing and distribution of branded, value-added consumer items. The Company builds on its founder’s legacy of innovation, quality, and integrity with focus on its purpose statement \n—\n Inspired People. Inspired Food.™\n The Company has continually expanded its product portfolio through organic growth and acquisitions. Today, the Company is a global branded food company bringing some of the most trusted and iconic brands to tables across the globe with approximately $12 billion in annual revenue generated from more than 80 countries.\nDescription of Business\nSegments\nThe Company currently operates with the following three operating and reportable segments: Retail, Foodservice, and International.\nRetail\nThe Retail segment consists primarily of the processing, marketing, and sale of food products sold predominantly in the retail market in the United States. This segment also includes the results from the Company’s MegaMex Foods, LLC joint venture.\nFoodservice\nThe Foodservice segment consists primarily of the processing, marketing, and sale of food products for foodservice, convenience store, and commercial customers located in the United States.\nInternational\nThe International segment processes, markets, and sells Company products internationally. This segment also includes the results from the Company’s international joint ventures, international equity method investments, and international royalty arrangements.\nNet sales to unaffiliated customers, segment profit, and certain other financial information by segment are reported in Note P - Segment Reporting of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nProducts and Distribution\nThe Company develops, processes, and distributes a wide array of food products in a variety of markets and manufactures its products through various processing facilities and trusted co-manufacturers. The Company’s products primarily consist of meat, nuts, and other food products sold across multiple distribution channels, such as United States (U.S.) retail, U.S. foodservice, and internationally.\nThe Company sells its products in all 50 U.S. states. The Company’s products are sold through its sales personnel, who operate in assigned territories or in dedicated teams serving major customers and who are coordinated from sales offices predominately located in major U.S. cities. The sales team is also responsible for the product portfolio of MegaMex Foods, LLC (MegaMex Foods), a U.S. based Mexican food company, of which the Company owns a minority interest. Additionally, the Company utilizes independent brokers and distributors. Products are primarily distributed by common carrier.\nThe Company has a global presence within several major international markets, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Korea. Distribution of export sales to customers is by third party carriers, while the China and Brazil operations also rely on company-owned and operated delivery systems. The Company has licensed companies to manufacture various products internationally on a royalty basis. The Company also has minority positions in food companies in the Philippines (The Purefoods-Hormel Company, Inc., 40 percent holding) and Indonesia (PT Garudafood Putra Putri Jaya Tbk (Garudafood), approximately 30 percent holding). \nRaw Materials\nThe Company concentrates on the marketing and sale of branded, value-added food products. The principal raw materials used by the Company include pork, turkey, beef, chicken, and nuts. The Company takes what it believes is a balanced approach to sourcing its raw materials. To meet its needs for pork raw materials, the Company purchases hogs for the Austin, Minnesota processing facility, enters into long-term supply agreements for pork, and supplements this with spot market purchases of pork. \n3\nTable of Contents\nThe majority of the turkeys needed to meet raw material requirements are raised by the Company. Production costs from raising turkeys are subject to fluctuations in grain prices and fuel costs. To manage input cost risks, the Company uses futures, swaps, and options contracts to hedge a portion of its anticipated purchases. \nThe Company also purchases raw materials from various suppliers. As the Company has shifted its focus toward a more value-added portfolio, it has become increasingly dependent on these suppliers to meet its raw material needs. Certain raw materials, such as cashews, are sourced internationally, which may cause additional risks to pricing and availability. The Company utilizes supply contracts and forward buying strategies in its effort to ensure an adequate supply and mitigate price fluctuations. \nHuman Capital\nThe Company’s employees are the driving force behind innovation, improvement, and success. As of October 27, 2024, the Company had approximately 20,000 active employees, with over 90 percent located within the U.S. Approximately 20 percent of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Contracts at two of the Company's facilities, covering approximately 300 employees, expire in the next fiscal year. The Company believes it has good relations with its workforce.\nTalent Acquisition, Development, and Retention\nHormel’s team members are the cornerstone of the Company and of the fulfillment of its purpose — \nInspired People. Inspired Food.™\n The Company places great importance on the growth, development, and engagement of its team members. \nThe Company offers competitive compensation packages to its employees and provides a multitude of benefits, including medical, life and disability insurance, contributory and non-contributory retirement savings plans, free post-secondary tuition and tuition reimbursement programs, and two years of tuition-free community and technical college for U.S. employees’ dependent children. In fiscal 2024, the Company provided financial support for a new, third-party operated childcare center in Austin, Minnesota, providing a needed service for team members and the Austin community.\nThe Company believes investing in the education, training, and development of employees contributes to the overall success of the business. The Company provides learning opportunities for employees through various training courses, including instructor-led internal and external programs and on-the-job training.\nThe Company considers the tenure of its team members to be an important indicator of overall performance and is proud of its tenure figures. As of October 27, 2024, approximately 50 percent of the Company’s team members had five or more years of service, and the 37-person officer team had an average of 23 years of service.\nCreating an Inclusive Environment\nThe Company welcomes the diversity, unique skills, thoughts, and experiences of its team members, customers, and consumers. As of October 27, 2024, the Company’s U.S. workforce for majority-owned operations was made up of approximately 40 percent female and approximately 60 percent underrepresented minorities. The Company’s U.S. salaried employees for majority-owned operations as of October 27, 2024 was made up of approximately 35 percent female and approximately 25 percent underrepresented minorities. By fostering an inclusive culture, the Company enables every member of the workforce to leverage unique talents and high-performance standards to drive innovation and success.\nThe Company has twelve employee resource groups (ERGs) that support the Company’s mission to create a workplace where all people feel welcomed, respected, and valued. These employee-driven groups play a critical role in the Company’s efforts to create an inclusive environment and provide professional development and mentorship opportunities. \nSafety, Health, and Wellness\nThe Company’s dedicated corporate safety department develops and administers company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each employee and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards and comparable global requirements internationally. The corporate safety department also conducts regular audits of Company-owned production facilities to ensure compliance with Company safety policies. The Company conducts safety training for all team members and, during fiscal 2024, completed approximately 1,200 safety assessments each month.\nThe Company recognizes that team members perform best when they are healthy, and that optimal performance is necessary for the Company to achieve its key results. In addition to the health care benefits package, the Company’s Inspired Health program aims to cultivate and maintain a culture of health and wellness that is focused on encouraging and empowering team members to make healthy lifestyle choices through awareness, prevention, and positive health behavior changes. This program includes biometric screenings, on-site fitness centers and fitness center discounts, an online health university with robust information and resources, a tobacco cessation program, wellness challenges, and confidential health and wellness support.\nGovernmental Regulation and Environmental Matters\nThe Company’s operations are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies which oversee areas such as food safety, workforce mobility, environmental laws, animal welfare, financial and tax regulations, and the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of the Company’s products. The Company believes it is in compliance with current laws and regulations and does not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on its capital expenditures, earnings, or \n4\nTable of Contents\ncompetitive position. The Company continues to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and, while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not expect compliance to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. In addition to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has set aspirational goals to further improve its sustainability efforts and reduce its environmental impact. These goals are outlined in the Company’s 20 by 30 Challenge and address topics such as renewable sourcing, reducing organic waste and greenhouse gas emissions, supporting regenerative agriculture, packaging sustainability, and reducing food waste. The Company’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.\nSignificant Customers\nThe Company serves many customers throughout the world across various sales channels. Sales to the Company’s largest customer, Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (Walmart), accounted for approximately 16 percent of consolidated gross sales less returns and allowances during fiscal 2024. Walmart is a customer for the Company’s Retail and International segments. The Company’s top five customers collectively represented approximately 37 percent of consolidated gross sales less returns and allowances during fiscal 2024. The loss of one or more of the top customers in any of the reportable segments could have a material adverse effect upon such segment’s financial results.\nCompetition\nThe production and sale of meat and food products in the U.S. and internationally is highly competitive. The Company primarily competes with manufacturers of pork and turkey products as well as national and regional producers of other meat and protein sources, such as beef, chicken, fish, nuts, and plant-based proteins.\nAll operating segments compete on the basis of price, product quality and attributes, brand identification, breadth of product line, and customer service. Through effective marketing, a dedicated network of direct and indirect sales personnel, and robust quality assurance programs, the Company’s strategy is to provide high quality products that possess strong brand recognition supported by reliable customer service, to support a higher value proposition for customers. To grow and maintain its competitive position, the Company focuses on meeting consumer preferences, delivering product innovation, and maintaining long-term and lasting relationships with industry partners.\nPatents and Trademarks\nThere are numerous patents and trademarks important to the Company’s business. As of October 27, 2024, the Company held 22 U.S. and eight foreign patents. Most of the trademarks the Company uses are registered in the U.S. and other countries.

  "item7": "Item 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\n \nOPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nFiscal 2024: \nThe Company believes fiscal 2024 demonstrated the solid execution of its strategy, the power of its portfolio and the resilience of its team. The Company achieved net sales of $11.9 billion, declining 2 percent compared to the prior year, as the benefit from broad-based growth in the Foodservice segment and value-added growth in the Retail segment from \nApplegate\n®\n, value-added fresh pork, bacon, and value-added turkey, was more than offset by declines in the Retail and International segments. Declines in the Retail segment were driven primarily by significant year-over-year pricing declines for whole bird and commodity turkey and softness in the Convenient Meals & Proteins vertical. International net sales declines were driven by lower commodity exports and lower net sales in China. Segment profit increased 2 percent compared to prior year, as favorable results in the International segment were partially offset by unfavorable results in the Retail segment. Segment profit for the Foodservice segment was comparable to the prior year. Net earnings increased 1 percent compared to the prior year, as improved segment profit and favorable interest and investment income were partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Adjusted net earnings\n(1)\n — excluding the impact of costs associated with the Company’s Transform and Modernize (T&M) initiative, litigation settlements, and the gain on the divestiture of Hormel Health Labs, LLC (Hormel Health Labs) — declined 2 percent. Diluted earnings per \n16\nTable of Contents\nshare and adjusted diluted earnings per share\n(1)\n for fiscal 2024 were $1.47 and $1.58, respectively, compared to $1.45 and $1.61 last year.\nInternational segment profit increased significantly compared to prior year due to contribution from the Company’s minority investments, improved mix and favorable costs in the Company's China business, and favorable export product mix. Segment profit for the Foodservice segment was comparable to the prior year as the benefit from higher sales and lower logistics expenses were offset by higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. Retail segment profit declined for the full year due to lower sales, lower equity in earnings of affiliates, and higher SG&A expenses. These declines were partially offset by the benefit from lower logistics expenses, savings from the T&M initiative, and the lapping of a non-cash impairment charge associated with the \nJustin’s\n®\n trade name in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2024 was an important year of investment for the Company's multi-year T&M initiative. The Company made meaningful progress on the initiative, which is expected to deliver long-term value to the organization.\nThe Company again reinvested into the business through capital expenditures and returned a record amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 were $256 million, including investments in capacity expansions for \nHormel\n®\n Fire Braised\n®\n products, \nApplegate\n®\n products and the Jiaxing, China, facility. The Company continues to prioritize investments in growth, innovation, cost savings, automation, and maintenance. Dividends paid to shareholders were a record $615 million.\nFiscal 2025 Outlook\n(2)\n:\n The Company continues to navigate through a dynamic consumer and operating environment. Organic net sales\n(1) \ngrowth of 1 percent to 3 percent is expected in fiscal 2025, which assumes benefits from modestly higher volumes, growth in key categories and markets, higher brand support and innovation, market-based pricing actions, and the current assumptions for raw material costs. From a bottom-line perspective, diluted earnings per share are expected to be $1.51 to $1.65 and adjusted diluted earnings per share\n(1)\n are expected to be $1.58 to $1.72. Earnings are expected to decline in the first half of the year as growth in key categories and markets is expected to be offset by the recovery from a prior year production disruption at the Company's Suffolk, Virginia, facility, the impact from lower commodity turkey markets, and higher SG&A expenses, including increased brand support through advertising. Segment profit growth from all three segments is expected in the back half of the year. Major risks to the outlook include incremental inflationary pressures and the impact of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s customers, consumers, and operators.\nThe Company remains in a strong financial position due to its consistent cash flow, liquidity, and solid balance sheet. The Company plans to continue to support the business through increased marketing and advertising investments for its leading brands. Further, continued capital expenditure investments including investments for data and technology related to its T&M initiative and capacity expansions for \nHormel\n®\n Fire Braised\n®\n products, \nApplegate\n®\n products and the Jiaxing, China, facility. The annual dividend for 2025 will be $1.16 per share, representing an increase of 3 percent and marking the 59th consecutive year of dividend increases. Returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends remains a top priority for the Company.\nConsistent with the plan outlined at its 2023 investor day, the Company expects fiscal 2025 to be a year of acceleration in its T&M initiative. For fiscal 2025, the Company expects a benefit to net earnings from its T&M initiative.\nA review of the Company’s fiscal 2024 performance compared to fiscal 2023 appears in the following section. A review of fiscal 2023 performance compared to fiscal 2022 is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2023, under the caption \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" which is incorporated herein by reference.\n(1)    See the \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section below for a description of the Company’s use of measures not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n(2)    All forward-looking comparisons for fiscal 2025 are comparing fiscal 2024 GAAP figures to projected fiscal 2025 GAAP figures, unless otherwise noted.\nResults of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company is a processor of branded and unbranded food products for retail, foodservice, and commercial customers.\nThe Company reports its results in the following three reportable segments:\nThe Retail segment consists primarily of the processing, marketing, and sale of food products sold predominantly in the retail market in the United States. This segment also includes the results from the Company’s MegaMex Foods, LLC joint venture.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe Foodservice segment consists primarily of the processing, marketing, and sale of food products for foodservice, convenience store, and commercial customers located in the United States.\nThe International segment processes, markets, and sells Company products internationally. This segment also includes the results from the Company’s international joint ventures, international equity method investments, and international royalty arrangements.\nThe Company’s fiscal year consisted of 52 weeks in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022. Fiscal year 2025 will consist of 52 weeks.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nNet Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share\n \nFourth Quarter Ended\nFiscal Year Ended\nIn thousands, except per share amounts\nOctober 27, 2024\nOctober 29, 2023\n% Change\nOctober 27, 2024\nOctober 29, 2023\n% Change\nNet Earnings Attributable to Hormel Foods Corporation\n$\n220,196\n \n$\n195,935 \n12.4 \n$\n805,038\n \n$\n793,572 \n1.4 \nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n0.40\n \n0.36 \n11.1 \n1.47\n \n1.45 \n1.4 \nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\n(1)\n0.42\n \n0.42 \n— \n1.58\n \n1.61 \n(1.9)\n(1)    See the \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section below for a description of the Company’s use of measures not defined by U.S. GAAP.\nVolume and Net Sales\n \nFourth Quarter Ended\nFiscal Year Ended\nIn thousands\nOctober 27, 2024\nOctober 29, 2023\n% Change\nOctober 27, 2024\nOctober 29, 2023\n% Change\nVolume (lbs.)\n1,108,203\n \n1,155,445 \n(4.1)\n4,288,290\n \n4,411,738 \n(2.8)\nNet Sales\n$\n3,138,091\n \n$\n3,198,079 \n(1.9)\n$\n11,920,797\n \n$\n12,110,010 \n(1.6)\nVolume for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2024 declined, as higher volume in the Foodservice segment was more than offset by lower volume in the Retail segment, primarily in the Convenient Meals & Proteins and the Value-Added Meats verticals. \nNet sales declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, as higher net sales in the Foodservice and International segments were more than offset by declines in the Retail segment, driven by significant year-over-year pricing declines for whole bird turkeys and lower sales of \nPlanters\n®\n \nsnack nuts resulting from production disruptions at the Suffolk, Virginia, facility.\nFull year fiscal 2024 net sales declined compared to the prior year, as the benefit from broad-based growth in the Foodservice segment and value-added growth in the Retail segment from \nApplegate\n®\n, value-added fresh pork, bacon, and value-added turkey, was more than offset by declines in the Retail and International segments.

For full year fiscal 2024, the increase in SG&A expenses and SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales is attributed to higher employee-related expenses, higher consulting fees related to the Company’s T&M initiative, and antitrust settlements, partially offset by the lapping of an unfavorable arbitration ruling in the prior year.

The Company does not allocate deferred compensation, non-recurring expenses associated with the T&M initiative, investment income, interest expense, or interest income to its segments when measuring performance. The Company also retains various other income and expenses at the corporate level. Equity in earnings of affiliates is included in segment profit; however, earnings attributable to the Company’s corporate venturing investments and noncontrolling interests are excluded. These items are included below as Net Unallocated Expense and Noncontrolling Interest when reconciling to Earnings Before Income Taxes.\nThe Company is an integrated enterprise, characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations, and sharing of assets. Therefore, the Company does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the profit and other financial information shown below.\n \nFourth Quarter Ended\nFiscal Year Ended\n \nOctober 27,\nOctober 29,\n \nOctober 27,\nOctober 29,\n \nIn thousands\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nNet Sales\n \n \n \n \n \n \nRetail \n$\n1,907,071\n \n$\n1,983,253 \n(3.8)\n$\n7,374,149\n \n$\n7,749,039 \n(4.8)\nFoodservice \n1,046,008\n \n1,032,353 \n1.3 \n3,845,118\n \n3,639,492 \n5.6 \nInternational \n185,012\n \n182,474 \n1.4 \n701,529\n \n721,479 \n(2.8)\nTotal Net Sales\n$\n3,138,091\n \n$\n3,198,079 \n(1.9)\n$\n11,920,797\n \n$\n12,110,010 \n(1.6)\nSegment Profit\nRetail\n$\n152,932\n \n$\n118,660 \n28.9 \n$\n562,768\n \n$\n577,690 \n(2.6)\nFoodservice\n154,340\n \n167,571 \n(7.9)\n596,292\n \n595,682 \n0.1 \nInternational\n27,058\n \n9,511 \n184.5 \n92,084\n \n55,234 \n66.7 \nTotal Segment Profit\n334,331\n \n295,743 \n13.0 \n1,251,144\n \n1,228,606 \n1.8 \n   Net Unallocated Expense\n54,064\n \n49,485 \n9.3 \n215,304\n \n214,482 \n0.4 \nNoncontrolling Interest\n(236)\n(452)\n47.8 \n(407)\n(653)\n37.7 \nEarnings Before Income Taxes\n$\n280,030\n \n$\n245,805 \n13.9 \n$\n1,035,434\n \n$\n1,013,472 \n2.2 \n20\nTable of Contents\nRetail\n \nFourth Quarter Ended\nFiscal Year Ended\n \nOctober 27,\nOctober 29,\n \nOctober 27,\nOctober 29,\n \nIn thousands\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nVolume (lbs.)\n744,521\n \n788,030 \n(5.5)\n2,915,141\n \n3,055,393 \n(4.6)\nNet Sales\n$\n1,907,071\n \n$\n1,983,253 \n(3.8)\n$\n7,374,149\n \n$\n7,749,039 \n(4.8)\nSegment Profit\n152,932\n \n118,660 \n28.9 \n562,768\n \n577,690 \n(2.6)\nAdjusted Segment Profit\n(1)\n152,932\n \n147,043 \n4.0 \n562,768\n \n606,073 \n(7.1)\n(1)    See the \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section below for a description of the Company’s use of measures not defined by U.S. GAAP.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, growth from many branded items, including \nApplegate\n®\n natural and organic meats, \nHormel\n®\n \nBlack Label\n®\n bacon, the \nSPAM\n®\n family of products, \nJennie-O\n®\n ground turkey, and \nHormel\n®\n Square Table™\n entrees was more than offset by volume and net sales declines driven by the Value Added Meats, Snacking & Entertaining, and Convenient Meals & Proteins verticals. Excluding the impact of last year's non-cash impairment charge, adjusted segment profit\n(1) \nincreased due to continued benefits from lower logistics expenses and incremental savings from the T&M initiative.\nFull year fiscal 2024 volume and net sales declined as value-added growth from many branded items was more than offset by declines in the Value Added Meats, Convenient Meals & Proteins, and Snacking & Entertaining verticals. For fiscal 2024, segment profit declined due to lower sales, lower equity in earnings of affiliates, and higher SG&A expenses. These declines were partially offset by the benefit from lower logistics expenses and savings from the T&M initiative. Additionally, a non-cash impairment charge of $28.4 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 associated with the \nJustin’s\n®\n trade name.\nIn fiscal 2025, the Company expects modest net sales growth and comparable volumes for its Retail segment. Top line growth is expected to be supported by key categories, higher brand support, and innovation. Earnings are expected to grow compared to the prior year. Risks to this outlook include slowing consumer demand, unfavorable sales mix, and higher-than-expected operating costs.\nFoodservice\n \nFourth Quarter Ended\nFiscal Year Ended\n \nOctober 27,\nOctober 29,\n \nOctober 27,\nOctober 29,\n \nIn thousands\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nVolume (lbs.)\n283,944\n \n279,288 \n1.7 \n1,061,730\n \n1,026,772 \n3.4 \nNet Sales\n$\n1,046,008\n \n$\n1,032,353 \n1.3 \n$\n3,845,118\n \n$\n3,639,492 \n5.6 \nSegment Profit\n154,340\n \n167,571 \n(7.9)\n596,292\n \n595,682 \n0.1 \nFourth quarter volume and net sales growth were driven by strong performance across the premium prepared proteins, salty snacks, turkey, bacon, and pizza toppings categories. Products such as Heritage Premium Meats offerings, \nHormel\n®\n Fire Braised\n®\n meats, branded \nJennie-O\n®\n turkey, \nPlanters\n® \nsnack nuts, and \nCafe H\n®\n globally inspired proteins delivered top line growth. Segment profit decreased due to lower margins in Heritage Premium Meats, poultry, and pizza toppings as well as higher SG&A expenses.\nFull year fiscal 2024 volume and net sales increased due to broad-based growth across many categories. Segment profit was comparable to prior year as the benefit from higher sales, lower logistics expenses, and savings from the T&M initiative were offset by lower fourth quarter margins and higher SG&A expenses.\nIn fiscal 2025, the Company anticipates year-over-year growth for volume, net sales, and segment profit from its Foodservice segment after removing the impacts from the Hormel Health Labs divestiture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Risks to this outlook include a softening of foodservice industry demand, lower-than-expected raw material markets which through market-based pricing can negatively impact net sales, and higher-than-expected operating costs.\nInternational\n \nFourth Quarter Ended\nFiscal Year Ended\n \nOctober 27,\nOctober 29,\n \nOctober 27,\nOctober 29,\n \nIn thousands\n2024\n2023\n% Change\n2024\n2023\n% Change\nVolume (lbs.)\n79,737\n \n88,128 \n(9.5)\n311,419\n \n329,573 \n(5.5)\nNet Sales\n$\n185,012\n \n$\n182,474 \n1.4 \n$\n701,529\n \n$\n721,479 \n(2.8)\nSegment Profit\n27,058\n \n9,511 \n184.5 \n92,084\n \n55,234 \n66.7 \nFor the fourth quarter, net sales grew due to demand in China and strong branded exports for \nSPAM\n®\n luncheon meat and \nSkippy\n®\n peanut butter. Considerable volume declines in turkey exports resulted in lower volumes compared to prior year. \n21\nTable of Contents\nSegment profit for the quarter was significantly above the prior year, due to improved export margins, favorable results in China, and growth from our investments in the Philippines and Indonesia.\nFull year fiscal 2024 volume and net sales declined as higher branded exports were more than offset by lower commodity exports and lower net sales in China. Segment profit increased significantly due to contribution from the Company’s minority investments, improved mix and favorable costs in the Company's China business, and favorable export product mix.\nIn fiscal 2025, the Company anticipates year-over-year growth for volume, net sales, and segment profit from its International segment. Risks to this outlook include macroeconomic conditions in multinational markets, cost inflation, and potential political tariffs.\nUnallocated Income and Expense\n \nFourth Quarter Ended\nFiscal Year Ended\n \nOctober 27,\nOctober 29,\nOctober 27,\nOctober 29,\nIn thousands\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet Unallocated Expense\n$\n54,064\n \n$\n49,485 \n$\n215,304\n \n$\n214,482 \nNoncontrolling Interest\n(236)\n(452)\n(407)\n(653)\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, net unallocated expense increased as higher employee-related expenses and expenses related to the Company’s T&M initiative were partially offset by favorable rabbi trust performance and a gain on the divestiture of Hormel Health Labs. For fiscal 2024, net unallocated expense was comparable to the prior year as expenses related to the Company’s T&M initiative, higher employee-related expenses, and expenses related to antitrust settlements were offset by the lapping of an unfavorable arbitration ruling in the prior year, higher interest income, and favorable rabbi trust performance. \n(1)\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nThis filing includes measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. The Company utilizes these non-GAAP measures to understand and evaluate operating performance on a consistent basis. These measures may also be used when making decisions regarding resource allocation and in determining incentive compensation. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they aid analysis and understanding of the Company’s results and business trends relative to past performance and the Company’s competitors. Non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for GAAP measures in analyzing financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nTransform and Modernize (T&M) Initiative\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company announced a multi-year T&M initiative. In presenting non-GAAP measures, the Company adjusts for (i.e., excludes) expenses for this initiative that are non-recurring, comprised primarily of project-based external consulting fees and asset write-offs related to portfolio optimization (i.e., reducing the complexity and optimizing the assortment of the product portfolio). The Company believes that non-recurring costs associated with the T&M initiative are not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating cost structure; therefore, the Company is excluding these discrete costs. The Company does not adjust for (i.e., does not exclude) certain costs related to the T&M initiative that are expected to continue after the project ends, such as software license fees and internal employee expenses, because those costs are considered ongoing in nature as a component of normal operating costs. The Company also does not adjust for savings realized through the T&M initiative as these are considered ongoing in nature and reflect expected ongoing operating performance.\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs expenses related to discrete legal matters that the Company believes are not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance, do not reflect expected future operating costs, and may not be meaningful when comparing the Company’s operating performance against that of prior periods. The Company adjusts for (i.e., excludes) these expenses.\nLitigation Settlements\nIn the second and third quarters of fiscal 2024, the Company entered into settlement agreements with certain plaintiffs in its pending antitrust litigation. See Note J - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nArbitration Ruling\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company accrued for an unexpected, unfavorable arbitration ruling involving an isolated commercial dispute with a third party. This matter was settled in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\n22\nTable of Contents\nGain on Sale of Business\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company sold the Hormel Health Labs business, resulting in a gain on the sale. The Company believes the one-time benefit from the sale is not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating cost structure, is not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance, and may not be meaningful when comparing the Company’s operating performance against that of prior periods. Thus, the Company adjusted for (i.e. excluded) the gain.\nOrganic Net Sales\nThe non-GAAP adjusted financial measurement of organic net sales provides investors with additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Organic net sales excludes the impact of the sale of the Hormel Health Labs business in the Foodservice segment in fiscal 2024. \nImpairment Charges\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company incurred impairment charges associated with the \nJustin’s\n®\n trade name and a corporate venturing investment. The Company believes that non-recurring costs for these impairments are not reflective of the Company’s ongoing operating cost structure, are not indicative of the Company’s core operating performance, do not reflect expected future operating costs, and may not be meaningful when comparing the Company’s operating performance against that of prior periods; therefore, the Company is excluding these discrete costs.\nThe tables below show the calculations to reconcile from the GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The tax impacts were calculated using the effective tax rate for the quarter in which the transactions occurred.\nFourth Quarter Ended\nFiscal Year Ended\nin thousands, except per share

The Company repaid a portion of long-term debt by using existing cash on hand and the proceeds from new debt issued in fiscal 2024. Cash provided by operating activities has been sufficient to cover dividend payments and capital expenditures during fiscal 2024. The purchase of a minority interest in Garudafood was the primary driver of the decline in cash and cash equivalents in the prior year. Additional details related to significant drivers of cash flows are provided below.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\n▪\nCash flows from operating activities were largely impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities.\n–\nIn fiscal 2024, inventory decreased $95 million due to a better alignment of product levels with customer demand as well as less turkey and associated feed supplies. The $36 million decrease in fiscal 2023 was a result of strategic inventory management efforts implemented to address elevated inventory levels.\n–\nPrepaid expenses and other assets decreased $13 million in fiscal 2024 compared to an increase of $69 million in fiscal 2023. This activity was primarily related to settlements associated with the Company’s hedging activities.\n26\nTable of Contents\n–\nIn fiscal 2024, accounts receivable was comparable to the prior year, decreasing $2 million. The $49 million decrease in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to timing of sales and more efficient collections.\n–\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses decreased $27 million in fiscal 2024 related to the timing of payments which was partially offset by higher employee-related and promotional expenses. In fiscal 2023, accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased $141 million related to the timing of payments and lower promotional and incentive compensation expenses.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\n▪\nCapital expenditures were $256 million and $270 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The most notable projects in fiscal 2024 were investments for capacity expansions in Barron, Wisconsin and at the Jiaxing, China, facility. Significant projects for fiscal 2023 included investments in a new production line for the \nSPAM\n®\n family of products in Dubuque, Iowa, the initial phases of the transition from harvest to value-added capacity in Barron, Wisconsin, wastewater infrastructure in Austin, Minnesota, and pepperoni capacity in Omaha, Nebraska.\n▪\nIn fiscal 2023, the Company purchased a minority interest in Garudafood for $426 million.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\n•\nThe Company paid $950 million of its senior unsecured notes upon maturity on June 3, 2024.\n•\nProceeds from the issuance of long-term debt were $498 million during fiscal 2024. The Company issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million due March 2027.\n▪\nCash dividends paid to the Company’s shareholders are an ongoing financing activity for the Company with payments totaling $615 million in fiscal 2024 and $593 million in fiscal 2023. The annualized dividend rate was $1.13 per share in fiscal 2024, compared to $1.10 per share in fiscal 2023.\n▪\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased 310,000 shares of its common stock for $12 million.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe Company believes its balanced business model, with diversification across raw material inputs, channels, and categories, provides stability in ever-changing economic environments. The Company maintains a disciplined capital allocation strategy and uses a waterfall approach, which focuses first on core uses of cash, such as capital expenditures to maintain facilities, dividend returns to investors, mandatory debt repayments, and fulfillment of pension obligations. Next, the Company looks to strategic items in support of growth initiatives, such as other capital projects, acquisitions, additional dividend increases, and working capital investments. Finally, the Company evaluates opportunistic uses, including incremental debt repayment and share repurchases.\nThe Company believes its anticipated income from operations, cash on hand, borrowing capacity under the current unsecured revolving credit facility, and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet all short-term and long-term commitments. The Company continues to look for opportunities to make investments and acquisitions that align with its strategic priorities. The Company has multiple sources of liquidity to complete such investments and acquisitions. For example, the Company’s historic ability to leverage its balance sheet through the issuance of debt has provided the flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities.\nDividend Payments\nThe Company remains committed to providing returns to investors through cash dividends. The Company has paid 385 consecutive quarterly dividends since becoming a public company in 1928. The Board of Directors approved an increased annual dividend rate for fiscal 2025, raising it to $1.16 per share from $1.13 per share, representing the 59th consecutive annual dividend increase.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures are allocated to required maintenance and growth opportunities based on the needs of the business. Capital expenditures supporting growth opportunities in fiscal 2025 are expected to focus on projects related to value-added capacity, infrastructure, and new technology. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 are estimated to be $275 million to $300 million.\nDebt\nAs of October 27, 2024, the Company’s outstanding debt included $2.9 billion of fixed rate unsecured senior notes due in fiscal 2027, 2028, 2030, and 2051 with interest payable semi-annually. During fiscal 2024, the Company made $69 million of interest payments and the Company expects to make $73 million of interest payments in fiscal 2025 on these notes. On March 8, 2024, the Company issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. These proceeds were used, along with cash on hand, to repay $950 million in senior unsecured notes which matured on June 3, 2024. See Note L - Long-term Debt and Other Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n27\nTable of Contents\nBorrowing Capacity\nAs a source of short-term financing, the Company maintains a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The maximum commitment under this credit facility may be further increased by $375 million, generally by mutual agreement of the lenders and the Company, subject to certain customary conditions. Funds drawn from this facility may be used by the Company for general corporate purposes, which may include repaying existing debt, funding acquisitions, and for working capital or other general purposes. The lending commitments under the facility are scheduled to expire on May 6, 2026, at which time the Company will be required to pay in full all obligations then outstanding. As of October 27, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings from this facility.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Company’s debt agreements contain customary terms and conditions including representations, warranties, and covenants. These debt covenants limit the ability of the Company to, among other things, incur debt for borrowed money secured by certain liens, or engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions, and the covenants require the Company to maintain certain consolidated leverage ratios. As of October 27, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants in its debt agreements and expects to maintain compliance in the future.\nCash Held by International Subsidiaries\nAs of October 27, 2024, the Company’s international subsidiaries held $225 million of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains all undistributed earnings as permanently reinvested. The Company evaluates the balance and uses of cash held internationally based on the needs of the business. \nShare Repurchases\nThe Company is authorized to repurchase 3,677,494 shares of common stock as part of an existing plan approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. Under the share repurchase authorization, the Company may repurchase shares periodically, depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. The share repurchase authorization has no expiration date. The Company did not repurchase any shares of stock during fiscal 2024. The Company continues to evaluate share repurchases as part of its capital allocation strategy.\nCommitments\nThe Company’s material cash commitments as of October 27, 2024 are as follows:\nIn millions\nPayments Due by Periods\nTotal\nLess than 1 year\n1-3 years\n3-5 years\nMore than 5 years\nPurchase Commitments\n(1)\n$\n2,597 \n$\n1,235 \n$\n940 \n$\n246 \n$\n177 \nDebt Repayments\n(2)\n2,850 \n— \n500 \n750 \n1,600 \nInterest Payments on Long-term Debt\n(2)\n713 \n73 \n134 \n85 \n421 \nPension & Other Post-retirement Benefit Payments\n(3)\n1,172 \n107 \n224 \n233 \n609 \nLease Obligations\n(4)\n205 \n46 \n71 \n45 \n43 \nOther Commitments\n(5)\n69 \n45 \n24 \n— \n— \n(1)\n    \nThe Company commits to purchase quantities of livestock, grain, and other raw materials to ensure a steady supply of production inputs.

Lease payments exclude $36.0 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced.\n(5)    Includes obligations related to infrastructure improvements supporting various manufacturing facilities and a media advertising agreement.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of October 27, 2024, the Company had $49.3 million of standby letters of credit issued on its behalf. The standby letters of credit are primarily related to the Company’s self-insured workers' compensation programs. This amount includes revocable standby letters of credit totaling $2.7 million for obligations of an affiliated party that may arise under workers' compensation claims. Letters of credit are not reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n28\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that can have a meaningful effect on the reporting of consolidated financial statements. See Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCritical accounting estimates are defined as those reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes the following are its critical accounting estimates:\nTrade Promotions\nDescription:\n The Company promotes products through consumer incentives and trade promotions. These promotional programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, slotting fees, coupons, rebates, and in-store display incentives. Customer trade promotion and consumer incentive activities are recorded as a reduction to revenue and a corresponding accrued liability based on amounts estimated as variable consideration.\nJudgments and Uncertainties:\n The Company estimates variable consideration associated with promotional programs using the expected value method to determine the total expected consideration. Estimating variable consideration requires judgment and is based largely on an assessment of anticipated performance informed by historical experience, expected participation, and current market trends.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change:\n The liability relating to these promotional activities is based on a review of the outstanding contracts for which performance has taken place but which remain unpaid. As of October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, the Company's accrued trade promotion liabilities were $81.8 million and $64.1 million, respectively. \nIncome Taxes\nDescription:\n The Company records income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting. Deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law. Changes in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur.\nJudgments and Uncertainties:\n The Company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its annual tax provision.\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change:\n While the Company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the Company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. The Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination, based on its technical merits. The position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. A change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change. As of October 27, 2024, the Company had $20.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, recorded in Other Long-term Liabilities.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangibles\nDescription: \nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include trade names obtained through business acquisitions which are originally recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is the residual after allocating the purchase price to net assets acquired and is allocated across the Company’s reporting units: Retail, Foodservice, and International. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the carrying value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value, it is considered impaired which requires a reduction to earnings. See Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Company’s procedures.\nJudgments and Uncertainties: \nDetermining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating the fair value of the Company’s goodwill reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment testing requires significant judgment. Indefinite-lived trade names are evaluated for impairment using an income approach utilizing the relief from royalty method. Significant assumptions include royalty rate, annual projected revenue, discount rate, and estimated long-term growth rate. Estimating the fair value of goodwill reporting units using the discounted cash flow model requires management to make assumptions and projections of future cash flows, revenues, earnings, discount rates, long-term growth rates, and other factors.\n29\nTable of Contents\nSensitivity of Estimate to Change: \nThe assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with the Company’s operating strategy. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company performed a qualitative assessment to evaluate its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. No impairment charges were recorded as a result of the testing.\nFiscal 2024 net sales for \nPlanters\n® \nsnack nuts were negatively impacted by production disruptions at the Suffolk, Virginia, facility. The Company believes these impacts are short term in nature (less than one year) and projects sales to recover to historical levels shortly after supply normalizes. Should the impact last longer, or be more severe than currently anticipated, it is likely the Company would have to recognize an impairment charge on this trade name, which is currently valued at $675 million.\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\nDescription:\n The Company sponsors several defined benefit pension and post-retirement health care benefit plans and recognizes the associated expenses, assets, and liabilities.\nJudgments and Uncertainties: \nIn accounting for these employment costs and the associated benefit obligations, management must make a variety of assumptions and estimates including mortality rates, discount rates, compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates, and interest crediting rates. The Company considers historical data as well as current facts and circumstances when determining these estimates. Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on fair value, composition of the asset portfolio, historical long-term rates of return, and estimates of future performance. Mortality and discount rates used are based on actuarial tables elected at each fiscal year-end. The Company uses third-party specialists to assist in the determination of these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses and the outstanding obligation.\nBenefit plan assets are reported at fair value. Due to the lack of readily available market prices, fund managers value private equity investments using models that include a combination of available market data and unobservable inputs that consider earnings multiples, discounted cash flows, and other qualitative and quantitative factors. Other benefit plan investments are measured at Net Asset Value (NAV) per share of the fund’s underlying investments as a practical expedient. \nSensitivity of Estimate to Change: \nThe assumed discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increase, interest crediting rate, and the health care cost trend rate have a significant impact on the amounts reported for the benefit plans. For the year ended October 27, 2024, the Company had $1.3 billion and $191.6 million in pension benefit obligation and post-retirement benefit obligation, respectively. For fiscal 2025, the Company expects pension benefit costs of $44.9 million and post-retirement benefit costs of $9.9 million. A one-percentage-point change in these rates would have the following effects:\nOne-Percentage-Point\nBenefit Cost\nBenefit Obligation\nIn millions\nIncrease\nDecrease\nIncrease\nDecrease\nPension Benefits\nDiscount Rate\n$\n(13.2)\n$\n15.8 \n$\n(133.5)\n$\n162.4 \nExpected Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets\n(12.9)\n12.9 \n— \n— \nRate of Future Compensation Increase\n3.1 \n(2.7)\n4.3 \n(3.7)\n   Interest Crediting Rate\n5.6 \n(4.7)\n16.8 \n(14.2)\nPost-retirement Benefits\nDiscount Rate\n$\n(0.2)\n$\n(0.9)\n$\n(13.8)\n$\n16.0 \nHealth Care Cost Trend Rate\n0.9 \n(0.8)\n15.8 \n(13.9)\nAs of October 27, 2024, the Company had $87.3 million of private equity and real estate funds and $724.5 million of investments carried at NAV. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate these risks by performing various procedures, such as comparing the expected returns based on appropriate benchmarks to reported market values and performing price tests on certain underlying investments. Additionally, a look back comparison of values from audited financial statements to unaudited statements and roll forward calculations of known cash activity are completed to obtain further assurance of reporting accuracy. These procedures cover a majority of the value held in the private equity and NAV investments for each investment type. Variances larger than specified thresholds are investigated further to verify the reported values are reasonable.\nSee Note G - Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n30\nTable of Contents",
