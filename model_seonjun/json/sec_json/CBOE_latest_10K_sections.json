  "item1": "Item 1.    Business \nThe following description of the business should be read in conjunction with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. This description contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements due to the factors set forth in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nCboe Global Markets, Inc., the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, delivers cutting-edge trading, clearing and investment solutions to people around the world. Cboe provides trading solutions and products in multiple asset classes, including equities, derivatives, and FX, across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Above all, the Company is committed to building a trusted, inclusive global marketplace that enables people to pursue a sustainable financial future. \nCboe’s subsidiaries include the largest options exchange and the third largest equities exchange operator in the U.S. In addition, the Company operates Cboe Europe, one of the largest equities exchanges by value traded in Europe, and owns Cboe Clear Europe, a leading pan-European equities and derivatives clearinghouse, BIDS Holdings, which owns a leading block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S., and provides block-trading services with Cboe market operators in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan, Cboe Australia, an operator of trading venues in Australia, Cboe Japan, an operator of trading venues in Japan, Cboe Clear U.S., an operator of a regulated clearinghouse, and Cboe Canada Inc., a recognized Canadian securities exchange. Cboe subsidiaries also serve collectively as a leading market globally for exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) listings and trading. \nThe graphic below provides a brief overview of Cboe’s history:\n7\nTable \no\nf Contents\nOur Business \nCboe reports on the following six business segments:\n•\nOptions.\n The Options segment includes options on market indices (“index options”), as well as on the stocks of individual corporations (“equity options”) and on ETPs such as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and exchange-traded notes (“ETNs”), which are “multi-listed” options and listed on a non-exclusive basis. These options are eligible to trade, as applicable, on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and/or other U.S. national security exchanges. Cboe Options is the Company’s primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on the Cboe Options trading floor in Chicago. C2 Options, BZX Options, and EDGX Options are all-electronic options exchanges, and typically operate with different market models and fee structures than Cboe Options. The Options segment also includes applicable market data fees revenues generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary options market data, index licensing, routing services, and access and capacity services.\n•\nNorth American Equities. \nThe North American Equities segment includes U.S. equities and ETP transaction services that occur on fully electronic exchanges owned and operated by BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, equities transactions that occur on the BIDS Trading platform in the U.S. and Canada, and Canadian equities and other transaction services that occur on or through Cboe Canada Inc.’s order books. The North American Equities segment also includes corporate listing services on Cboe Canada Inc., ETP listings on BZX, the Cboe Global Markets, Inc. common stock listing, and applicable market data fees revenues generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary equities market data, routing services, and access and capacity services.\n•\nEurope and Asia Pacific.\n The Europe and Asia Pacific segment includes the pan-European listed equities and derivatives transaction services, ETPs, including exchange traded funds, exchange traded notes, and exchange traded commodities, and international depository receipts that are hosted on MTFs operated by Cboe Europe Equities (Cboe Europe and Cboe NL equities exchanges) and Cboe Europe Derivatives (“CEDX”). It also includes the ETP listings business on RMs and clearing activities of Cboe Clear Europe, as well as the equities transaction services of Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan, operators of trading venues in Australia and Japan, respectively, along with equities transactions that occur on the BIDS Trading platform in Australia and Japan. Cboe Europe operates lit and dark books, a periodic auctions book, a closing cross book, and two BIDS orderbooks; a Large-in-Scale (“LIS”) trading negotiation facility and - predominantly for UK and Swiss symbols - a volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) trajectory crossing facility. Cboe NL, based in Amsterdam, operates similar business functionality to that offered by Cboe Europe (with exception of Trajectory Crossing), and provides for trading only in European Economic Area (“EEA”) symbols. Cboe Europe Derivatives, a pan-European derivatives platform, offers futures and options based on Cboe Europe equity indices, and single stock options. Cboe Clear Europe offers the clearing of equity and equity-like instruments for Cboe-operated and other regulated trading venues, the clearing of derivative transactions executed on CEDX, and has recently introduced a service to clear Securities Financing Transactions. This segment also includes Cboe Europe, Cboe NL, CEDX, Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.\n•\nFutures.\n The Futures segment includes transaction services provided by CFE, a fully electronic futures exchange, which includes offerings for trading of VIX futures and other futures products, the licensing of proprietary market data, as well as access and capacity services. On April 25, 2024, the Company announced plans to transition the cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange, to CFE in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review.\n•\nGlobal FX.\n The Global FX segment includes institutional FX trading services that occur on the Cboe FX fully electronic trading platform, non-deliverable forward FX transactions (“NDFs”) offered for execution on Cboe SEF, as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services. The segment includes transaction services for U.S. government securities executed on the Cboe Fixed Income fully electronic trading platform.\n•\nDigital.\n The Digital segment includes a regulated futures exchange (Cboe Digital Exchange) and a regulated clearinghouse (Cboe Clear U.S.), as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services. Prior to May 31, 2024, the Digital segment also included a U.S.-based spot digital asset trading market (“Cboe Digital spot market”). As of May 31, 2024, the Cboe Digital spot market is closed for all participant and trading purposes. In addition, the Company plans to transition the cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange, to CFE in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review. The Company expects that Digital will cease to be a distinct reportable business segment in the first quarter of 2025.\n8\nTable \no\nf Contents\nCboe also presents three financial statement revenue captions that reflect the Company’s diversified products,  expansive geographical reach, and overall business strategy. Below is a summary of Cboe’s financial statement revenue  caption businesses:\n•\nCash and spot markets. \nThis includes associated transaction and clearing fees on our equities and FX markets and clearing business, the portion of market data fees relating to associated U.S. tape plan market data fees, associated regulatory fees, and associated other revenue from Cboe’s North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific, Global FX, and Digital segments.

Cboe delivers cutting-edge trading, clearing and investment solutions across the globe through a comprehensive ecosystem that helps drive innovation and growth.\nStrategic Focus\nOur strategy is to build one of the world’s largest global derivatives and securities networks to create value and drive growth by:\n•\nInvesting in the continued growth of our core business in Global Derivatives;\n•\nEnhancing recurring revenue opportunities through Cboe Data Vantage (f/k/a Data and Access Solutions);\n•\nHarnessing our global network to expand product reach & access;\n•\nCapitalizing on the demand for access to the U.S. capital markets;\n•\nLeveraging our superior technology to drive innovations; and\n•\nAllocating capital and resources to areas where we expect to see the strongest long-term returns for shareholders.\nKey Business Highlights\nThe following is a brief summary of our key 2024 business highlights:\n•\nLaunched new products and indices such as cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether Futures, Options on VIX Futures, Cboe S&P 500 Variance Futures, Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index and options thereon, and U.S. Treasury Market Volatility Index.\n•\nEnhanced existing collaborations with S&P Dow Jones Indices with plans to launch the Cboe S&P 500 Constituent Volatility Index.\n•\nDrove FTSE Russell innovation in digital asset derivatives and with MSCI to offer new index options and volatility indices.\n•\nWorked to expand retail access to index options.\n•\nIntroduced dedicated cores in our equities markets.\n•\nBuilt out our technology offerings in each of the U.S. and our international markets.\n•\nIntroduced a central counterparty clearing service for European SFT.\n10\nTable \no\nf Contents\n•\nContinued to expand our geographic footprint with a minority stake in Japannext Co., Ltd.\n•\nReallocated technology resources from integration efforts to organic revenue opportunities.\n•\nRealigned the digital asset business to leverage our core strengths in derivatives, technology and product innovation. \nDerivatives Markets\nWe are one of the largest U.S. derivatives market operators, operating four options markets, Cboe Options, BZX Options, EDGX Options and C2 Options, operating a futures market, CFE, as well as operating a pan-European derivatives market, Cboe Europe Derivatives (“CEDX”). The key products traded on our derivatives markets are proprietary products, including our flagship products SPX options and VIX options and futures, and multi-listed products. \nOur U.S. derivatives options market, Cboe Options, is a hybrid market combining open outcry floor trading with electronic trading. For multi-listed products, depending on the product, we utilize public customer priority, market turner, participation rights and pro-rata allocation market models, as well as the “classic” pricing model (known as payment for order flow). For proprietary products, we use price-time or pro-rata allocation, alongside public customer priority in certain instances, and market turner, combined with a pricing model where all market participants generally pay fees. Our other three options markets, BZX, EDGX and C2, are fully electronic and utilize a mix of price-time, customer priority, participation rights, pro-rata allocation, maker-taker and classic pricing market models.\nCFE’s U.S. derivatives futures market, which is fully electronic, utilizes a price-time market model, combined with a pricing model where all market participants generally pay fees, subject to specified exceptions.\nCEDX, which is fully electronic, utilizes a pro-rata allocation market model.\nProprietary Products\nWe are a leader in the volatility space with the volatility-based proprietary products we offer for trading. These volatility-based proprietary products are built through Cboe Labs, a dedicated team centered on the creation, development, and implementation of new ideas and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers, which are both described below in further detail. We offer proprietary products on our proprietary indices and indices owned by other index providers. Our most frequently traded proprietary products include SPX options and VIX options and futures.\nSPX Options\nThe S&P 500 Index is an index comprised of 500 large-cap U.S. listed companies. It is one of the most commonly followed indices and is considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy. The SPX options we offer on the S&P 500 Index are exclusive to Cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fee revenues. Because of the S&P 500 Index’s status as a bellwether, SPX options are used in many different trading strategies by customers with different goals, including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options, asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using risk-managed strategies to capture so-called “risk premia” embedded in option prices. We also offer zero days to expiry (0-DTE) products, Long Term Equity AnticiPation Securities (LEAPs), Mini- and Nano-SPX options, FLEX- and FLEX micro-SPX options, and SPX Weeklys options, which have settlements on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and on the last trading day of each month and 24x5 trading in SPX options. We believe these additional expirations provide customers with more precision when hedging overall portfolio risk. \nVolatility Trading\nCboe pioneered the trading of exchange-traded volatility products with its introduction of VIX futures in 2004 and VIX options in 2006. The VIX Index (as defined below), although not directly tradable, is based on the mid-point of real-time quotes of SPX options and is designed to reflect investors’ consensus view of future 30-day expected stock market volatility. The VIX Index methodology provides the basis for the creation of VIX options and futures. The final settlement value of VIX options and futures is determined on their expiration date through a Special Opening Quotation (“SOQ”) of the VIX Index. The SOQ calculation uses opening trade prices of selected options; unless there is no opening price, in which case the opening price used in the SOQ calculation is the midpoint of the highest bid and lowest offer at the time of the opening. Since we started offering these products, we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies, including hedging extreme stock market declines, also known as “tail risk” hedging, and risk-managed strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future.\nTo help investors better manage market volatility, we also offer the 1-Day Volatility Index (VIX1D), the U.S. Treasury Market Volatility Index (VIXTLT), VIX Weeklys options and futures, mini VIX futures, nearly 24x5 trading in VIX options and futures, Cboe S&P 500 Variance Futures, and Options on VIX futures.\n11\nTable \no\nf Contents\nProprietary Indices\nWe also calculate and disseminate proprietary indices that are licensed for use by third parties or are used as the basis for Cboe proprietary products. These proprietary indices are built through our in-house Cboe Labs research and development and Cboe Data Vantage business teams, often in connection with our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers, which are both described below in further detail. Our proprietary indices include:\n•\nvolatility indices based on broad-based market indices, such as the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000, \n•\nvolatility indices based on ETFs,\n•\nindices based on Bitcoin ETFs, and\n•\noptions strategy benchmark indices, such as the Cboe BuyWrite, PutWrite, and Collar indices based on the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, BuyWrite and PutWrite indices based on MSCI EAFE and MSCI Emerging Markets indices, and BuyWrite indices based on other broad-based market indices.\nIn addition to any transaction fee revenue generated from trading of products based on these indices on Cboe exchanges, we distribute these indices through the Cboe Global Index Feed index data subscription service and, together with index providers with whom we have strategic relationships, we license proprietary indices for third parties to use to create third-party indices and products. Accordingly, we generate revenue from proprietary indices by distributing them for reference purposes, using them as the basis for proprietary products and licensing them for use for third-party indices and products. \nIndex Provider Relationships\nThe Company has long-term business relationships with several providers of market indices. We license their indices, including on an exclusive basis, as the foundation for indices, index options and other products. The Company also has agreements in place to work jointly with key providers to develop new indices and products and services that are expected to capitalize on our core competencies and diversify our sources of revenue. Of particular note are the following: \n•\nS&P Dow Jones Indices (“S&P”). \nWe have the following licensing arrangements with S&P:\n◦\nS&P Indices. \nWe have the exclusive right to offer exchange-listed options contracts in the United States on the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 100 Index, the S&P 500 ESG Index, and the S&P Select Sector Indices as a result of a licensing arrangement with S&P. Our license from S&P is through December 31, 2033, with an exclusive license to trade options on the S&P 500 Index through December 31, 2032. We use the market data from the trading of options on the S&P 500 Index and S&P 100 Index for the creation of Cboe volatility indices, such as the Cboe Volatility Index (“VIX Index”), and to create tradable products on those volatility indices\n.\n◦\nMarkit Indices.\n We have a worldwide license through August 22, 2025 to offer futures, options, and options on futures on indices designed to reflect values of investment grade and high-yield U.S. corporate bonds. Unless either party elects otherwise, this agreement auto-renews for successive two-year periods. Pursuant to our license, we offer futures and options on futures on high yield and investment grade corporate bond indices.\n◦\nDow Jones Indices. \nWe have the exclusive right during standard U.S. trading hours to offer listed options contracts in the United States on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Dow 10 Index, and non-exclusive rights to offer listed options on several other Dow Jones indices including the Dow Jones Utilities Average and Dow Jones Transportation Average. This licensing arrangement extends through December 31, 2033. We use market data from the trading of options on these indices to create Cboe volatility indices, variance indicators and BuyWrite indices, and we trade options and other products on these indices.\n•\nFTSE Russell. \nUnder our license agreement with the London Stock Exchange Group’s (“LSEG”) leading global index franchises, Frank Russell Company and FTSE International Limited (together “FTSE Russell”), we have the exclusive or first right in the United States to offer listed options on more than two dozen FTSE Russell indices, which represent a diverse group of domestic and global equities with international appeal. Our exclusive license from FTSE Russell is through April 1, 2030. We offer options on the Russell 2000, Russell 1000, Russell 1000 Value and Russell 1000 Growth indices and mini-options on the Russell 2000 Index.\n•\nMSCI\n. \nWe have an agreement with MSCI Inc. (“MSCI”) in which we have the right to offer U.S.-listed options on several of MSCI’s indices including the MSCI EAFE, MSCI Emerging Markets, MSCI World, MSCI ACWI, and MSCI USA indices. The agreement term extends until December 31, 2031, but our license to list options on the MSCI indices contained in the agreement could expire on September 30, 2026 if either party elects not to extend. We use \n12\nTable \no\nf Contents\nmarket data from the trading of the MSCI EAFE and MSCI Emerging Markets index options (among other inputs) to calculate volatility indices and several versions of BuyWrite and PutWrite strategy indices.\nCboe Data Vantage\nThe Cboe Data Vantage business provides an offering of market data and information solutions products across multiple asset classes and geographic regions that are designed to suit our customers’ diverse needs. The Cboe Data Vantage business consists of three product groups:\n•\nMarket Data and Access Services.\n Data products include real-time depth of book quotation information, auction and complex option information, top of book quotes and trades, last sale information, and consolidated equity feeds.

Fees, net of plan costs, from UTP, CTA, and OPRA are allocated and distributed to plan participants like us according to their share of tape fees based on a formula, required by Regulation NMS, which may take into account both trading and quoting activity. \nCash and Spot Markets\nWe are one of the largest equities market operators, operating four U.S. equities exchanges, international exchanges in Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia, as well as a number of alternative trading systems and an FX platform.\nOur four U.S. equities exchanges, BZX, EDGX, BYX and EDGA, which are fully electronic, operate various market and pricing models including price-time, and price-time with retail priority, as well as various pricing models, including maker-taker and taker-maker fee structures. In addition to these market models, each of the U.S. equity exchanges provides numerous specific order types that are designed to enhance their respective market models.\nBIDS Trading, the U.S. equities ATS market, which is fully electronic and is an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the Exchanges, utilizes a sponsored access model to provide anonymous executions in NMS stocks. Cboe and BIDS Trading collaborate in operating similar venues with our cash and spot markets in Australia, Canada, Europe, and Japan.\nOur fully electronic Canadian securities exchange, Cboe Canada Inc., offers four order books, NEO-L, NEO-N, NEO-D and MATCHNow, which operate various market models including maker-taker, taker-maker, large order priority, and frequent call matches with continuous execution opportunities, among others.\nIn Europe, we operate a number of market models, including continuous Lit orderbooks, periodic auction orderbooks, dark midpoint orderbooks, a post-closing cross, as well as two BIDS Europe orderbooks.\n13\nTable \no\nf Contents\nCboe Australia is a regulated stock exchange that is fully electronic. Cboe Australia utilizes a model that charges a different ad valorem fee rate depending on whether a participant is making or taking liquidity.\nCboe Japan offers two fully electronic displayed markets, Cboe-Alpha and Cboe-Select. Cboe Japan also offers two fully electronic non-displayed markets, Cboe-Match, which matches VWAP orders during pre-market hours and Cboe BIDS Japan, which utilizes a price-time market model aiming for primary market mid-point trades.\nThe Cboe FX platform provides institutional FX trading services and utilizes a price-firmness-time priority market model. For our FX NDF markets, Cboe SEF utilizes a price-firmness-time priority market model.\nListing\nCboe operates five listing venues across the globe that are structured and designed, in the U.S. and Canada, for all types of equity instruments, such as ETPs, corporate securities, warrants and depositary receipts, while in the UK and European Union (\"EU\") they support ETPs only. In Australia, both ETPs and warrants are supported. Over the course of 2024, Cboe added approximately 730 listings across the globe and had approximately 2,460 listings as of December 31, 2024. Cboe also offers intralisting on its different equities markets through Cboe Global Listings, the first-of-its-kind, global listing network facilitating worldwide access to capital and secondary liquidity for companies and ETFs.\nClearing\nOur subsidiary Cboe Clear Europe, a European central counterparty (“CCP”), provides post-trade clearing services, to stock exchanges, multilateral trading facilities and for over-the-counter equities trades and exchange-traded derivatives trades. Cboe Clear Europe acts as a central counterparty that, for its clearing participants, becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. As a result, it guarantees the timely performance of the settlement obligations of buyers and sellers and takes on the risk of the performance of the transactions that it clears. Additionally, as a Financial Market Infrastructure, Cboe Clear Europe is subject to strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight. Cboe Clear Europe clears equities and equity like instruments traded on 47 European trading segments. Cboe Clear Europe also clears equity derivative instruments traded on Cboe NL. In 2024, Cboe Clear Europe provided CCP protection for an average of €49 billion of cleared value on a daily basis. Through the process of netting, in 2024, Cboe Clear Europe eliminated 70%, or €34 billion of the average daily cleared value, leaving an average daily settlement value of €15 billion. In 2023, Cboe Clear Europe provided CCP protection for an average of €44 billion of cleared value on a daily basis. Through the process of netting, in 2023, Cboe Clear Europe eliminated 71%, or €31 billion of the average daily cleared value, leaving an average daily settlement value of €13 billion. As of November 25, 2024, Cboe Clear Europe also launched a first-of-its-kind service for SFT in cash equities and ETFs, which includes central clearing, settlement and post-trade lifecycle management.\nCboe Clear U.S. is a CFTC-registered derivatives clearing organization (“DCO”) that provides clearing and settlement of cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts for its affiliate, Cboe Digital Exchange.\nCustomers\nOur customers generally include financial institutions, trading platforms, institutional and individual investors, and professional traders. Our equities and options customers in the United States include trading permit holders and members (as applicable) of Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, which are SEC-registered broker-dealers, and the customers of those broker-dealers.

For information regarding risks related to our customers see “Risk Factors.”\nCompetition\nThe industry in which we operate is intensely competitive. We believe we face competition on a number of factors, including: \n•\nprice, quality and speed of our trade and clearing execution; \n14\nTable \no\nf Contents\n•\nfunctionality and ease of use of our trading and clearing platforms; \n•\nreliability, integrity, depth of book, liquidity, range and functionality of our products and services;\n•\nintegrity of our marketplaces; \n•\ntechnological innovation and adoption;\n•\nour brand awareness; and \n•\nour reputation. \nWe believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors through a variety of methods, including:\n•\noffering access to a broad array of products and services, including proprietary products and market data;\n•\noffering fee schedules and pricing models that both attract order flow and provide incentives to liquidity providers; \n•\nproviding advanced technology that offers broad functionality, low latency, fast execution, ease of use, scalability, reliability, and security; \n•\noffering efficient, transparent and liquid marketplaces; \n•\noffering deep and liquid markets with opportunities for price improvement;\n•\noffering broad trading platform access in the EU;\n•\noffering efficient and transparent clearing services designed to help maximize netting opportunities;\n•\nmaintaining close relationships with customers; and \n•\nproviding customers with a comprehensive source of information on options and ETPs as well as extensive options education. \nIn our proprietary products, we compete against other futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products, as well as against financial market participants that offer similar over-the-counter derivatives. We also compete against certain multi-listed options products, such as SPY options and cash settled index options, which may offer similar market exposure of our proprietary products, such as SPX options.\nThe listed options industry is extremely competitive. As of December 31, 2024, our four options exchanges compete with 14 other U.S. options exchanges, in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology. Most of the equity and ETP options listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on the other exchanges. In addition, the options exchanges that we compete with set fees and rebates to attract multi-listed options business to their exchanges, which has historically reduced the net revenue per contract that we generate from multi-listed options, and the options exchanges that we compete with structure their options businesses in partnership with established market participants, such as consolidators, and other order flow providers, to increase their volume traded.\nOur U.S. equities and the BIDS Trading ATS compete against 12 other equities exchanges as of December 31, 2024, and over 25 other ATSs and single dealer platforms. Market participants have multiple venues for the execution of orders, including national securities exchanges and numerous off-exchange venues, including other ATSs and broker-dealers that internalize orders off-exchange. Additionally, corporate and ETP issuers have multiple venues they can choose from in the listing of their products. In Canada, our recognized Canadian securities exchange, Cboe Canada Inc., competes with several Canadian exchanges and ATSs. In Australia, our exchange, Cboe Australia, competes with other Australian exchanges and crossing systems. In Japan, our equities exchanges and PTSs, compete with several Japanese exchanges and other PTSs.\nThe market for execution and clearing services in Europe became more competitive following the introduction of MiFID II and the Regulation on Markets in Financial Instruments (Regulation (EU) No 600/2014) (“MiFIR”). Our major competitors in Europe include national stock exchanges, other pan-European MTFs, systematic internalizers, and other European clearinghouses.\nThe global FX market remains severely fragmented, with transparent automated marketplaces such as Cboe FX challenging a small number of similarly situated competitors. While the global FX market has experienced a shift from competing interbank platforms to ECNs, the electronification of the spot and NDF FX market may encounter resistance from customers that still prefer to utilize the phone, instant chats, terminals and key banking relationships for price discovery and trading. Furthermore, levels of electronification of the FX market have remained relatively static. The electronic spot FX market is also intensely competitive, with over 10 other venues competing for market share as of December 31, 2024. Cboe measures and reports on market share against a narrower set of competitors, included in those venues. \nIn addition, Cboe Data Vantage faces competition from other securities exchanges, technology companies, third-party market data providers, and information and software vendors, which have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchanges or trading venues. The sale of our proprietary data products is also under competitive threat from ATSs and trading venues that offer similar products. Distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products.\n15\nTable \no\nf Contents\nTechnology\nCboe's Trading Technology\nThe trading platform for our equities, options, and futures markets is built upon our Cboe Titanium technology platform. It is developed, owned, and operated in-house and is designed to optimize reliability, speed, scalability, and versatility. Using common protocols and features, Cboe’s unified Cboe Titanium technology platform is designed to offer customers an efficient, consistent experience regardless of where they are in the world. Our exchanges provide different market models, appealing to different user bases, and the trading technologies support all of them. Further, the technologies are designed to support many specialized features for each of the markets, such as: dark pools, trade reporting facility, systematic internalizer, Large-in-Scale, smart order routing, FLEX options, 24x5 trading, and hybrid trading (combining electronic and open outcry). In addition, Cboe and its applicable subsidiaries operate separate trading and/or clearing platforms, as applicable, for BIDS Trading, certain Cboe Canada Inc. order books, Cboe Digital Exchange, Cboe Clear U.S., Cboe Clear Europe, and Cboe FX.\nOur trading platforms have generally experienced very low operational downtime and low latency. We have undertaken significant efforts to upgrade our Cboe Titanium technology platform to help meet increased performance and capacity requirements and help ensure competitiveness, support growth and advance a consistent world class platform globally. The trading platforms use readily available hardware, thereby minimizing capital outlays required for each new market entry. Also, in order to continue to implement new enhancements to our trading platforms, new releases of software are generally deployed routinely in all of the applicable markets.\nDisaster Recovery\nWe operate and maintain geographically diverse disaster recovery facilities for all of our markets. We expect that, in certain instances, the disaster recovery facilities can be up and running in a short period of time and in certain instances we may also work with our market participants to try to quickly reopen marketplaces. We regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests using our back-up data centers, as well as an annual test with our U.S. trading participants. Cboe Canada Inc., as required by local regulations, conducts internal testing of its disaster recovery data processing capabilities at least annually, and participates in the bi-annual testing coordinated by CIRO. Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan conduct internal testing of their disaster recovery data processing capabilities at least annually. In Europe, we also regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests which use our back-up data center, as well as an annual test with our European trading participants. We continue to work to improve both the availability of our technology and our disaster recovery facilities.\nEmerging Technologies\nWe are exploring the potential use of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning, blockchain, distributed ledger technology, quantum computing, the cloud, and other emerging technologies to potentially help drive new products, increase productivity, improve our self-regulatory oversight responsibilities, and increase automation of tasks.\nRouting and Clearing\nOCC is the sole provider of clearing on all of our U.S. options exchanges and CFE. National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”), a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTC”), is the sole provider of clearing on our U.S. listed equity exchanges. The Canadian Depository for Securities (“CDS”) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on Cboe Canada Inc. With respect to Australian equities and derivatives, Cboe Australia delivers matched trades of its customers to ASX Clear Pty Ltd and ASX Settlement Pty Ltd. ASX Clear Pty Ltd acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Australia. The Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (“JSCC”) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on Cboe Japan’s Cboe-Alpha, Cboe-Select, Cboe-Match and Cboe BIDS Japan. BofA Securities, Inc. (“BOA”) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on BIDS Trading. Cboe Europe Equities relies on LCH Limited and LCH SA (“LCH”), Cboe Clear Europe, and SIX x-clear Ltd (“SIX x-clear”) to clear trades in European listed equity securities and exchange traded products as part of an interoperable clearing model. For derivatives, Cboe NL relies on Cboe Clear Europe to clear both index and single stock derivative contracts. With respect to U.S. government securities transactions executed on Cboe Fixed Income, we use Mirae Asset Securities (USA) Inc. to deliver matched trades to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) Government Securities Division (GSD), which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Fixed Income and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of those matched trades. For SFT in cash equities and ETFs, Cboe Clear Europe provides central clearing, settlement and post-trade lifecycle management. Cboe Clear U.S. is the sole provider of clearing and settlement of all digital asset transactions occurring on Cboe Digital Exchange in cash-settled margin futures on Bitcoin and Ether.\nCboe Trading is a routing broker-dealer used by our four U.S. equities exchanges and our four U.S. options exchanges, including the electronic platform portion of Cboe Options. Cboe Trading’s clearing firms are Wedbush Securities, Inc. (“Wedbush”) and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”).\n16\nTable \no\nf Contents\nDigital Assets and Recent Developments\nCboe Digital is an operator of a CFTC-regulated futures exchange (Cboe Digital Exchange) and a CFTC-regulated clearinghouse (Cboe Clear U.S.). Prior to May 31, 2024, Cboe Digital Exchange and Cboe Clear U.S. also operated a U.S.-based spot digital asset trading market (“Cboe Digital spot market”), but as of May 31, 2024, the Cboe Digital spot market is closed for all participant and trading purposes. Cboe Digital does not engage in proprietary trading activities and does not maintain a trading entity. Cboe Digital does not maintain any digital assets, does not itself trade digital assets, does not trade on its own exchange, and does not maintain an affiliate trading entity for purposes of trading, market making, or liquidity provision on its exchange. Cboe Clear U.S. maintains its own operating funds in separate bank accounts from its customer funds.\nRegulatory Environment and Compliance\nVarious aspects of our business are subject to regulation by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, various state regulators, CIRO, the Canadian Securities Administrators (and, in particular, the Ontario Securities Commission or “OSC”), the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (“ASIC”), JFSA, JSDA, ESMA, FCA, the Central Bank of the Netherlands (“DNB”), AFM, Bank of England, and other international regulatory authorities where our exchanges or Cboe Clear Europe may be authorized to act as foreign exchanges or provide clearing services, and market participants may be subject to regulation by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, National Futures Association (“NFA”), FCA, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, U.S. Department of the Treasury and/or foreign regulators.\nRecent Developments\nLaws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed to address perceived problems, new products, or competition or at the request of market participants. In particular, both the SEC and CFTC will be under new leadership as part of the transition to President Trump's administration which adds additional uncertainty to the regulatory environment. The following is a brief discussion of recent regulatory developments that may significantly impact our business.\nUnited States\nEquity Market Structure \nIn December 2022, the SEC released four proposals that could impact equity market structure: (1) Disclosure of Order Execution Information (\"Rule 605\"); (2) Regulation NMS Amendments: Tick Size, Access Fees, and Transparency (“Tick Size/Access Fee Cap”); (3) Regulation Best Execution; and (4) Proposed Rule to Enhance Order Competition. Each of these proposals have been noticed for public comment, and in 2024, Rule 605 and the Tick Size/Access Fee Cap proposals were approved by the SEC and await implementation. Rule 605 may result in increased technology and compliance costs to Cboe. The Tick Size/Access Fee Cap rule is also likely to result in increased technology and compliance costs to Cboe, as well as potential adverse impact to Cboe’s trading volume and transaction fee revenue. The SEC has yet to take any additional action on Regulation Best Execution and Order Competition, but if adopted as-is, these proposals could result in market technology changes and additional compliance costs to Cboe. Further, it is possible that additional proposals or changes to the existing equity market structure could have a negative impact on our operations. In addition, bills are sometimes introduced in the U.S. Congress that also could potentially impact equity market structure and adversely impact our volumes and operations. See “Risk Factors” for more information. \nVolume Based Pricing Proposal\nOn October 18, 2023, the SEC released a proposed rule that would impact the way in which volume based discounts are applied (“Volume Based Proposal”). If adopted as-is, this Volume Based Proposal would prohibit national securities exchanges, including Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, from offering volume-based transaction pricing in connection with the execution of agency or riskless principal orders in NMS stocks, and likely inhibit Cboe’s ability to attract liquidity and offer competitive pricing to differentiate Cboe from our competitor exchanges. Although the proposed new rules do not appear likely to have a potential near term material impact, the new rules, if adopted as-is, may have a long term material impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results if, for example, there is a reduction of overall volumes, liquidity, or market share on Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA. See “Risk Factors” for more information. \nEurope\nOTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories\nRegulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (the “European Market Infrastructure Regulation” or “EMIR”) sets out rules relating to over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets, central counterparties and trade repositories. EMIR was enhanced \n17\nTable \no\nf Contents\nand amended by EMIR REFIT and EMIR 2.2. The final text on EMIR 3.0 entered into force on December 24, 2024. Further supporting regulatory technical standards are expected to be published over the course of 2025.\nEU Transparency Rules \nOn November 11, 2021, the European Council (“E.C.”) published its proposal for a review of EU market structure legislation, including proposed amendments to MiFIR and Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (“MiFID II”). The legislative phase of the review is now complete and revised MiFIR rules came into effect on March 28, 2024. The deadline for transposing MiFID II amendments is September 29, 2025. The final text includes, among other provisions, provision for a consolidated tape for the EU, a ban on payment for order flow, replacement of the double volume cap with a single volume cap for trades executed under certain trade waivers and changes to the transparency regime for equities. These provisions are expected to be implemented in the second half of 2025 through a number of level 2 measures. The legislation, as drafted, does not appear likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. However, there are review clauses contained in the legislation which provide a further opportunity to review the effectiveness of the transparency regime, at which point, potential changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. See “Risk Factors” for more information.\nCompliance\nU.S. Securities Industry\nFederal securities laws have established a two-tiered system for the regulation of securities exchanges and market participants. The first tier consists of the SEC, which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws. The second tier consists of self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), which are non-governmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the SEC. The Exchanges are SROs, each registered under Section 6 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) as a “national securities exchange,” and are subject to oversight by the SEC.\nSROs are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors. To be registered as a national securities exchange, an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the SEC prior to beginning operations. Among other things, the SEC must determine that the SRO has the ability to comply with the Exchange Act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange.\nIn general, an exchange SRO is responsible for operating its trading platforms consistent with its rules, and regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members. The rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and, among other things, provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer. Additionally, the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.\nAs registered national securities exchanges, virtually all facets of our Exchange operations are subject to the SEC’s oversight, as prescribed by the Exchange Act. The Exchange Act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities, including record keeping and the day-to-day responsibilities for market operations and broker-dealer oversight. Furthermore, as SROs, the Exchanges are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the SEC or other interested parties. The SEC also has broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses, suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange, or remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations. For example, in the past we have entered into consent orders with the SEC, under which our subsidiaries were censured, ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the Exchange Act, paid fines, and completed certain undertakings. \nAs part of its regulatory oversight, the SEC conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges, and the Exchanges have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections. To the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes, we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business, which may adversely affect our business. We collect certain fees to cover Section 31 fees charged to the Exchanges by the SEC and certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings. The Exchanges are responsible for the ultimate payment of Section 31 fees to the SEC. Additionally, under the rules of each of our exchanges, as required by the SEC, any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for non-regulatory purposes.\nSection 19 of the Exchange Act also provides that we must submit to the SEC proposed changes to any of the Exchanges’ rules, including revisions of their certificates of incorporation, bylaws, or other governing documents of the SROs or their parent companies. The SEC will typically publish the proposal for public comment, following which the SEC may approve or disapprove the proposal, as it deems appropriate. Certain categories of rule changes, like fee changes, can be effective on filing, but the SEC retains the ability to suspend or reject such filings within a prescribed period of time.\n18\nTable \no\nf Contents\nCanadian Securities Industry\nCboe Canada Inc. is subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by its primary provincial securities regulatory authority, the OSC. In addition, Cboe Canada Inc. is a Marketplace Member of, and subject to a regulation services agreement with, CIRO. The regulations applicable to Cboe Canada Inc. cover a wide array of areas, including, but not limited to, marketplace operations (which include corporate governance, fair access, systems compliance and integrity, and conflict management requirements), trading rules, electronic trading risk management, and financial viability.\nAustralian Securities Industry\nCboe Australia is subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by ASIC. The regulations applicable to Cboe Australia cover a wide array of areas, including, but not limited to, marketplace operations (which include corporate governance, fair access, systems compliance and integrity, and conflict management requirements), trading rules, electronic trading risk management, and financial viability.\nJapanese Securities Industry\nCboe Japan is subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by the JFSA and the JSDA. The regulations applicable to Cboe Japan cover a wide array of areas, including, but not limited to, marketplace operations (which include corporate governance, fair access, systems compliance and integrity, and conflict management requirements), trading rules, electronic trading risk management, and financial viability.\nFutures and Swaps Industry-CFE and Cboe SEF\nThe operations of each of CFE and Cboe SEF are subject to regulation by the CFTC under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”). The CEA generally requires that futures trading in the United States be conducted on a designated contract market and, in some cases, requires swaps trading to be conducted on a swap execution facility (“SEF”) or designated contract market (“DCM”). The CEA and CFTC regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded, and for a trading platform to be designated as a swap execution facility on which certain swaps may be traded. Designation as a contract market or swap execution facility for the trading of specified futures or swaps contracts is non-exclusive. This means that the CFTC may permit additional exchanges or trading platforms to be contract markets or swap execution facilities for trading the same or similar contracts. \nCFE is a designated contract market, and Cboe SEF is a swap execution facility, each of which is subject to the oversight of the CFTC and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the CEA. As a designated contract market, CFE is required to comply with the applicable core principles and regulations under the CEA, as is Cboe SEF as a swap execution facility. Each of CFE and Cboe SEF has surveillance and regulatory operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance by trading privilege holders with CFE rules, and by participants with Cboe SEF rules, as applicable. If CFE or Cboe SEF fails to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, it may be subject to: censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of its business, and removal of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of CFE’s designation as a contract market or Cboe SEF’s designation as a swap execution facility.\nDigital Assets\nCboe Digital Exchange is a CFTC-registered designated contract market, and Cboe Clear U.S. is a CFTC-registered derivatives clearing organization, each of which is subject to the oversight of the CFTC and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the CEA. As a designated contract market, Cboe Digital Exchange is required to comply with the applicable core principles and regulations under the CEA, as is Cboe Clear U.S. as a derivatives clearing organization. Each of Cboe Digital Exchange and Cboe Clear U.S. has surveillance and regulatory operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance by trading privilege holders with Cboe Digital Exchange rules, and by clearing members with Cboe Clear U.S. rules. If Cboe Digital Exchange or Cboe Clear U.S. fails to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, it may be subject to censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of its business, removal of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of Cboe Digital Exchange’s designation as a contract market or Cboe Clear U.S.’s designation as a derivatives clearing organization.\nCboe Clear U.S. has surrendered or is in the process of surrendering its money transmitter licenses in the states where such licenses or equivalent were required to conduct business in connection with the Cboe Digital spot market, which closed on May 31, 2024. In addition, Cboe Clear U.S. has surrendered its BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”).\nEurope\nCboe Europe is located in London and is subject to regulation in the UK and to certain European regulations. The current UK regulatory system was established by the Financial Services Act 2012 (“FSA12”), which amended the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The legislation replaced the previous financial services regulator, the Financial Services \n19\nTable \no\nf Contents\nAuthority, with three new bodies: The Financial Policy Committee (“FPC”), The Prudential Regulation Authority, and the FCA. Financial conduct of markets, including activity on, and the operation of, markets is regulated by the FCA, which is an independent non-governmental body, given statutory powers by the FSA12. The FCA has three statutory objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the markets for financial services. The FCA is accountable to His Majesty’s Treasury Ministers and, through them, to Parliament. \nCboe Clear Europe and Cboe NL are located in Amsterdam and subject to Dutch law and regulation. The current Dutch regulatory system was established by the Act on Financial Supervision. Financial conduct of markets, including activity on, and the operation of, markets is regulated by the AFM. Financial conduct of CCPs, including clearing activity is regulated by the AFM and DNB. The AFM is an independent non-governmental body, given statutory powers by the Act on Financial Supervision. The AFM has three strategic objectives: to promote the fair and conscientious provision of financial services, to promote the fair and efficient operation of the capital markets, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system. The AFM is accountable to the Minister of Finance. The DNB is the Dutch central bank, financial sector supervisor and resolution authority. The DNB is committed to a stable financial system: stable prices, solid financial institutions, and properly functioning payment transfers. Cboe Clear Europe is recognized as a non-UK CCP in the United Kingdom, which allows it to provide services to UK Clearing Participants and UK trading venues. Cboe Clear Europe is also recognized as a foreign central counterparty in Switzerland, which allows it to provide services to Swiss Clearing Participants and SIX Swiss Exchange AG. Cboe NL is also subject to regulation by ESMA.\nMuch of the UK and Dutch financial services regulation originates from the EU. Such regulation includes organizational requirements, capital resources requirements and the specific requirements for RMs and MTFs and are applicable to both Cboe Europe and Cboe NL. MiFID II and MiFIR set out requirements for RMs and MTFs with respect to the establishment of transparent and non-discretionary rules and procedures governing access and for fair and orderly trading and the efficient execution of orders, as well as to facilitate the efficient settlement of transactions conducted on RMs and MTFs and monitoring compliance with the rules. EMIR governs the CCPs operating in the EU and requires them to meet common risk management, governance and capital adequacy standards. The regulatory functions required of Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives, including Cboe Clear Europe and Cboe NL, by MiFID II, MiFIR, EMIR, and other relevant legislation and regulations are performed by in-house staff. Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives utilize the same state-of-the-art, real-time surveillance system that is used in the U.S. to monitor trading and market activities on BZX, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX. Cboe Clear Europe utilizes proprietary risk management software to monitor settlement and funding flows.\nGlobal FX\nWhile the global institutional spot FX market remains largely unregulated, the enactment of the Dodd Frank Act and its related regulations in the United States and the ongoing implementation of MiFID II and MiFIR in Europe have impacted the regulatory landscape for currency derivative products. For example, certain standardized currency derivative products are required to trade on an organized trading venue such as a SEF or DCM in the United States or on an MTF or organized trading facility in Europe. Moreover, even in the largely unregulated spot FX market, this movement towards additional trading standards and norms is highlighted by the publication of the FX Global Code in 2017 by the Global Foreign Exchange Committee, and re-affirmed in 2021, reflecting principles of good conduct for the wholesale FX market, and whose publication may lead to additional oversight in the global FX market. Cboe FX issued a Statement of Commitment declaring its commitment to conduct its FX market activities in a manner consistent with the principles of the FX Global Code. Following the publication of the FX Global Code regulators continue to take a closer look at the spot FX market, and any decision to impose new regulations may affect our spot FX business line.\nBroker\n-\nDealers\nCboe Trading, BIDS Trading, and Cboe Fixed Income are registered broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, FINRA, other SROs of which they are members and various state securities regulators. Cboe Trading currently operates as a routing broker-dealer for sending orders from the Exchanges to other venues for execution, including routing orders among the Exchanges. Cboe Trading is considered a facility of each of the Exchanges and is subject to the rules of the Exchanges. The Exchanges are responsible for enforcing Cboe Trading’s compliance with their rules, including to ensure Cboe Trading is not given preferential treatment. BIDS Trading currently operates an ATS, which is designed to bring counterparties together to anonymously trade large blocks of U.S. equities. BIDS Trading is not a member of any of the U.S. national securities exchanges and is not subject to exchange rules. Cboe Fixed Income, a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA, operates an electronic trading system for U.S. government securities targeted at the institutional inter-dealer market for trading on-the-run U.S. Treasury bonds and notes in the secondary OTC markets. Cboe Fixed Income’s participants are SEC registered broker-dealers that are members of The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation’s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation.\nCboe Trading, BIDS Trading, and Cboe Fixed Income are subject to SEC and SRO rules, as applicable, and, as registered broker-dealers, regulations concerning all aspects of their businesses, including: trading practices, order handling, best execution, anti-money laundering, handling of material non-public information, safeguarding data, reporting, capital adequacy, record retention, market access and the conduct of their officers, employees, and other associated persons. The SEC, SROs and state securities commissions may conduct proceedings which can result in injunctions or other sanctions, \n20\nTable \no\nf Contents\ncensures, fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders, or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers, or employees. The SEC and FINRA impose certain minimum capital requirement rules that require notification when a broker-dealer’s net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, dictate the ratio of debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer, constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances and impose certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital.\nIn addition, the ATS operated by BIDS Trading is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof, as such, Cboe intends to maintain the BIDS ATS as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the Exchanges. The Chief Executive Officer of BIDS Trading is expected to lead BIDS Trading as an independent business within Cboe, reporting into an independent committee of the board of Cboe Global Markets. Further, Cboe Trading will not route orders to BIDS Trading on behalf of the Exchanges.\nCboe Global Markets\nCertain aspects of Cboe Global Markets are also subject to SEC, FCA, and AFM oversight, including certain ownership and voting restrictions on its stockholders. The focus of the SEC’s regulation of Cboe Global Markets is to assure fair representation of members in the selection of the directors of the Exchanges, public participation in the governance of the Exchanges, and that the Exchanges can satisfy their regulatory responsibilities under the Exchange Act. Furthermore, the SEC requires that Cboe Global Markets give due regard to the preservation of the independence of the self-regulatory function of the Exchanges and to Cboe Global Markets’ obligations to investors and the general public. The SEC also requires that Cboe Global Markets not take any actions that would interfere with the effectuation of any decisions by the Board of Directors of any of the Exchanges relating to its regulatory functions or the structure of the market that it regulates or that would interfere with the ability of such Exchange to carry out its responsibilities under the Exchange Act. To the extent that Cboe Global Markets’ business activities involve or relate to the Exchanges, the officers and directors of Cboe Global Markets may be deemed to be officers and directors of the exchanges for purposes of and subject to oversight under the federal securities laws. Accordingly, the SEC may exercise direct supervision and disciplinary authority over certain Cboe Global Markets’ activities and those activities may be subject to SEC approval and, in some cases, public notice and comment. \nIn addition, Cboe Global Markets indirectly holds all of the issued share capital and voting rights in Cboe Europe and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cboe Chi-X Europe and Cboe NL. As a result, we and any person who holds, or has voting power with respect to, 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Cboe Global Markets common stock may be subject to certain regulatory requirements under UK and Dutch law. \nU.S. Regulatory Responsibilities\nOur U.S.-based exchanges are responsible for assessing the compliance of their TPHs or members, including Cboe Trading, with the respective exchange’s rules and the applicable rules of the SEC and/or CFTC. The main activities that the exchanges, as applicable, are required to monitor for the purpose of compliance with these rules include: \n•\nsurveillance designed to detect violations of exchange trading rules; \n•\nsurveillance designed to detect violations of SEC and/or CFTC rules; \n•\ninvestigation of matters involving potential rule violations; \n•\nthe investigation of complaints about possible rule violations brought by customers, TPHs, members, or other SROs; and \n•\nthe examination of TPHs or members for compliance with rules such as those related to net capital, books and records, market access, and other matters related to the TPHs’ or members’ exchange business functions. \nIn order to ensure market integrity, we regulate and monitor our TPHs’ and members’ trading activities by using both our employees and/or third parties under regulatory services agreements. See “U.S. Regulatory Agreements” below. Providing effective regulation is important for attracting and retaining the confidence and participation of market-makers, broker-dealers and institutional and retail investors.\nWe expend considerable time, financial resources, and effort to ensure that the exchanges’ rules and regulations conform to regulatory best practices within the securities and futures exchange industries and within the regulatory regime overseen by the SEC and CFTC, our primary U.S. regulators. In order to support our efforts and those of our market participants to comply with applicable law and our exchange rules, we developed a regulatory program to monitor market activity on our exchanges.\nAll of our Exchanges, CFE, and Cboe Digital Exchange are participants in various cooperative and regulatory information sharing agreements, including in the Intermarket Surveillance Group (“ISG”). ISG is an international information-sharing cooperative governed by a written agreement that provides for a comprehensive surveillance sharing arrangement. In addition to the agreement for confidential information sharing, the ISG provides a framework for the coordination of \n21\nTable \no\nf Contents\nregulatory efforts among exchanges trading securities, commodity futures, and related products to address potential intermarket manipulations and trading abuses. \nCFE, Cboe SEF, and Cboe Digital Exchange are also members of the Joint Audit Committee (“JAC”), which is a representative committee of the U.S. futures exchanges and regulatory organizations which participate in a joint audit and financial surveillance program that has been approved and is overseen by the CFTC. The JAC’s primary responsibility is to oversee the implementation and functioning of all terms and conditions of the Joint Audit Agreement and to determine the practices and procedures to be followed by each designated self-regulatory organization in the conduct of regulatory examinations and financial reviews of FCMs.\nAs part of the regulatory program, each of our Exchanges and CFE have rules pertaining to their respective disciplinary processes.\nU.S. Regulatory Agreements\nThe Exchanges and CFE have entered into agreements under which third parties have agreed to perform regulatory functions on behalf of our markets (e.g., regulatory services agreements). As discussed below, in addition, in certain other instances for our Exchanges, a third party has been allocated the regulatory responsibility under Rule 17d-1 or Rule 17d-2 under the Exchange Act, while in others, we retain the regulatory responsibility for the activities. \nRegulatory Services Agreement with FINRA\nThe Exchanges have entered into agreements with FINRA under which FINRA has agreed to provide regulatory services to the Exchanges. Under these agreements, FINRA performs certain regulatory functions on behalf of the Exchanges and, to avoid any potential conflicts of interest concerning the regulation and oversight of Cboe Trading, certain regulatory services specific to Cboe Trading. The Exchanges remain responsible for the regulation of their TPHs, members and marketplaces, and retain the authority for bringing disciplinary actions against their TPHs and members, although FINRA performs certain functions on behalf of the Exchanges. The Exchanges also perform certain regulatory and disciplinary-related functions in-house.\nRegulatory Services Agreement with OCC\nWhile CFE also performs most regulatory and disciplinary-related functions in-house, the OCC has performed and continues to perform certain regulatory functions on behalf of CFE pursuant to an RSA with CFE. Whether performed under an RSA or in-house, CFE retains overall responsibility for the regulation of its marketplace and for bringing disciplinary actions.\nRule 17d-1 Designations and Rule 17d-2 Agreements\nSection 17(d) of the Exchange Act and the related Exchange Act rules permit SROs to allocate certain regulatory responsibilities to avoid duplicative oversight and regulation. Under Exchange Act Rule 17d-1, the SEC designates one SRO to be the designated examining authority (“DEA”) for each broker-dealer that is a member of more than one SRO. The DEA is responsible for the regulatory oversight of applicable financial responsibility rules pertaining to that broker-dealer. Cboe Options is the DEA for several of its TPHs. Cboe Trading’s assigned DEA is FINRA. \nExchange Act Rule 17d-2 permits SROs to enter into agreements, commonly called Rule 17d-2 agreements, which are approved by the SEC and concern the allocation of regulatory responsibility for rules applicable to TPHs and members that those SROs have in common. The Exchanges have entered into certain bi-lateral Rule 17d-2 agreements under which FINRA is allocated responsibility for enforcing certain federal securities laws and certain exchange rules that are common with FINRA rules. The Exchanges have entered into certain other multi-party Rule 17d-2 agreements that allocate responsibility among the participating SROs, which may include the Exchanges, for oversight of their allocated common members compliance with certain rules governing, among other items, options related sales practices, options related market surveillance, insider trading, NMS and Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT”) NMS plan compliance. \nNational Market System Plans\nWe are member participants of several NMS plans including, but not limited to, the following: Cboe Options, C2, BZX, and EDGX are member exchanges in OPRA, which is the designated securities information processor for market information that is generated through the trading of exchange-listed securities options in the United States, and it disseminates certain core trading information, such as last sale reports and quotations. BZX, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX also participate in the CTA/CQ and the UTP Plans, which perform analogous services for the U.S. equities market. In November of 2024, the SEC approved a new Consolidated Tape Plan that, when fully operational, will replace the existing CTA/CQ and UTP Plans. The Securities Information Automation Corporation acts as the “processor” for OPRA and the CTA/CQ Plans. Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC acts as the processor for the Nasdaq Unlisted Trading Privileges Plan. See “Risk Factors” for more information regarding the consolidated data plan order.\n22\nTable \no\nf Contents\nCboe Options, C2, BZX, and EDGX are also parties to the Options Order Protection and Locked/Crossed Market Plan, which is designed to prohibit trade-throughs and avoid locked/crossed markets. Cboe Options, C2, BZX, and EDGX are also parties to the Options Listing Procedures Plan, which sets forth the procedures that the options exchanges must follow to list new options. Cboe Options, BZX, EDGA, and EDGX are also parties to the NMS plan for the selection and reservation of securities symbols. \nUnder the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority Plan (“ORSA Plan”), U.S. securities options exchanges are permitted to act jointly in the administration, operation and maintenance of a regulatory system for the surveillance, investigation and detection of the unlawful use of undisclosed, material information in trading in one or more of their markets. The ORSA Plan is intended to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency with which the exchanges regulate their respective markets and to avoid duplication of certain regulatory efforts. FINRA operates the ORSA Plan facility for options insider trading.\nThe Consolidated Audit Trail Plan (“CAT Plan”) functions as the limited liability company agreement of Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC (“CATLLC”), the limited liability company formed under Delaware state law through which the SROs (the “Plan Participants”) conduct the activities of the Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT”). The CAT Plan also serves as the national market system plan pertaining to the creation, implementation, and maintenance of a CAT that tracks orders throughout their lifecycle, which strives to enhance regulators’ ability to efficiently monitor trading activity in Eligible Securities in the U.S. securities markets. Eligible Securities currently include NMS Stocks, Listed Options and OTC Equities. Order and trade data is required to be reported to the CAT central repository the following day by each SRO/Plan Participant and broker-dealer (an “Industry Member”), along with certain customer and account information by each Industry Member. On November 15, 2016, the SEC approved the CAT Plan and a phased implementation was originally required to begin in November 2017; however, there were some delays. The first phase of CAT (“Phase 1”) ultimately went live in November 2018, at which time we and other SROs/Plan Participants began initial reporting of order and trade file submissions to the CAT. The second phase of CAT (“Phase 2”) for Industry Members began with order and trade file submissions in June 2020. The final Phase 2 implementation sub-phase (\"Phase 2e\"), related to Industry Member submissions to the customer and account information submissions system (“CAIS”), was completed on May 31, 2024.\nOn May 15, 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to the CAT Plan to establish financial accountability provisions to achieve full CAT implementation, including a financial accountability milestone requiring full implementation of the CAT requirements by December 30, 2022. If the SEC were to determine any financial accountability milestone was not met, it may limit the SROs’/Plan Participants’ recovery of certain loans previously advanced to CATLLC to fund CAT costs. Due to the delayed completion of CAIS, the SROs/Plan Participants have submitted to the SEC requests to extend the timeline for the completion of Phase 2e and the deadline for the final financial accountability milestone and additional requests may be submitted. If the SEC does not grant extensions and finds that the SROs/Plan Participants did not satisfy the related last financial accountability milestone, it could result in the SROs/Plan Participants not being able to recover certain amounts loaned to CATLLC to fund CAT costs associated with this final sub-phase, which the amount of unrecoverable costs may increase for additional delays.\nOn September 6, 2023, the SEC issued an order approving an amendment to the CAT Plan to implement a revised funding model (“CAT Funding Model”) for CATLLC to fund the CAT. The approved CAT Funding Model contemplates two categories of CAT fees calculated based on the “executed equivalent shares” of transactions in eligible securities: (i) CAT fees assessed by CATLLC to Industry Members who are CAT Executing Brokers (the brokers responsible for executing each side of the transaction) to recover a portion of historical CAT costs previously funded by monies loaned to CATLLC by the Plan Participants; and (ii) CAT fees assessed by CATLLC to CAT Executing Brokers and Plan Participants to fund prospective CAT costs. \nPrior to the effectiveness of the CAT Funding Model, the funding of the CAT was solely provided by the SROs/Plan Participants in exchange for promissory notes. Pursuant to the CAT Funding Model, the Plan Participants submitted fee filings during the third week of August 2024 to assess fees as of October 1, 2024 by CATLLC to CAT Executing Brokers for Buyers and Sellers that will be collected by CATLLC and remitted to the Plan Participants as repayment of or a portion of the promissory notes issued by the Plan Participants to fund the CAT prior to January 1, 2022 (the \"CAT Historical Assessment #1 Fee\"). Additional CAT fees that will be collected by CATLLC to recover a portion of other historical CAT costs incurred between January 1, 2022 and July 15, 2024 are planned to be introduced at a later time through separate fee filings submitted by the Plan Participants. CATLLC started remitting funds collected through the CAT Historical Assessment #1 to Plan Participants in December 2024 (for transactions occurring in October 2024) and will continue to do so until the balance due to be collected is paid in full, which is estimated to occur over approximately 24 months from the fee's implementation. \nAdditionally, pursuant to the CAT Funding Model, the Plan Participants submitted fee filings during the second week of August 2024 to implement the applicable initial transaction-based fee rates that are to be assessed by CATLLC to CAT Executing Brokers to cover a portion of prospective CAT costs, effective as of September 3, 2024. Pursuant to fee filings submitted by Plan Participants on behalf of CATLLC, as of September 3, 2024, CATLLC began assessing transaction-based fees to CAT Executing Brokers for Buyers and Sellers to cover a portion of prospective CAT costs. At the same time, CATLLC also began assessing a transaction-based fee to the respective Plan Participants for the same amount. To continue to fund CATLLC as it transitioned to collecting fees from Industry Members and Plan Participants to cover ongoing CAT costs in accordance with the CAT Funding Model, Plan Participants temporarily issued short-term notes to CATLLC to cover CAT costs that were payable to CATLLC until CATLLC collected sufficient proceeds from the fees to cover those costs. As of \n23\nTable \no\nf Contents\nJanuary 2025, CATLLC has fully repaid these short-term notes through funds collected from the fees assessed to CAT Executing Brokers and Plan Participants. CATLLC has also used the funds collected to pay CATLLC expenses and has retained excess funds as a reserve as per the CAT Funding Model and budget. Moving forward, CATLLC plans for the Plan Participants to submit prospective fee filings on CATLLC’s behalf every six months to update the transaction fee rates as necessary to cover prospective CAT costs. The last such filings were submitted in December 2024 and effected a rate change beginning January 2, 2025. The Company expects Plan Participants will no longer issue additional short-term notes to CATLLC to fund CAT given that CATLLC has begun imposing and collecting fees to cover CAT costs.\nOn October 17, 2023, the American Securities Association (“ASA”) and Citadel Securities, LLC (“Citadel”) filed a Petition for Review of the CAT Funding Model Order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit (“11th Circuit”). On November 16, 2023, the Cboe U.S. national securities exchanges, the NYSE U.S. national securities exchanges, the Nasdaq U.S. national securities exchanges and CATLLC (\"Intervenors\") filed motions to intervene on behalf of the SEC. On January 17, 2024, the 11th Circuit granted each of the motions to intervene on behalf of the SEC and established a briefing schedule and merits briefing concluded in the second quarter of 2024. \nOn September 13, 2024, Citadel filed a motion to stay the CAT Funding Model Order and to enjoin the collection of certain CAT fees during the pendency of this litigation, which the 11th Circuit denied on November 27, 2024. Oral argument on the merits was held on February 3, 2025. This challenge or any other challenge to the CAT Funding Model Order and/or Plan Participant(s) fee filings on behalf of CATLLC may significantly delay efforts by CATLLC to continue collecting the CAT fees. As a result, the Plan Participants may continue to incur additional significant costs, and/or it may result in them not being able to collect on the promissory notes related to the funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT. The Company believes the challenge is without merit and intends to vigorously litigate the matter.\nPortions of promissory notes related to the funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT may not be collectible, including if the SEC finds that the SROs/Plan Participants did not satisfy any of the financial accountability milestones. The allowance for notes receivable credit losses associated with the CAT is calculated using a methodology that is primarily based on the structure of the notes and various potential outcomes under the CAT Funding Model. See Note 23 (\"Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees\") for more information.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own or have rights to a number of intellectual property assets, including trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents.

We believe that our collective and unique perspectives fuel our capabilities, enhance our team spirit and enable us to attract and retain top talent as we define the markets of the future. Our commitment and responsibility in this regard starts at the top, with leadership and support from the full Cboe Board of Directors and executive team.\nTo maintain and strengthen our pledge to inclusion and to keep a level playing field, we regularly review key touchpoints across the employee journey with Cboe, from the talent selection, promotion, compensation, leadership development, and succession planning processes and make adjustments, as necessary, to help ensure opportunity parity across the Company. Our goal is to ensure that fair pay and equal opportunity for all that results in a collaborative, high performing organization bringing new innovations to market and providing superior service to our customers.\nAt Cboe, we also have associate resource groups that are open to all employees, regardless of identity.

Our participation rate exceeds standard benchmarks and a significant majority of our employees would recommend Cboe as a great place to work.\n Our senior management team continues to hold the commitment to an open-door policy and encourages the free flow of information and communication in furtherance of active transparency. With the recent strategic framework review, our ability to tap into the voice of our employees was critically important and we conducted a pulse survey to gauge sentiment. Our CEO also issues weekly letters to help connect with our employees. Human Resources also provided ongoing regular resources and tips to help support the variety of challenges, from hybrid work to childcare and elder care, that our employees faced throughout 2024. \nCboe also continues to create an open and frank atmosphere in which any grievance, complaint, suggestion or question receives a timely response. Cboe offers a whistleblower hotline for complaints, which can be made anonymously. Additionally, employees can raise questions and suggestions to the Cboe Human Resources team either in-person or via a group email address and are either responded to individually or addressed at our Global Town Hall meetings. The objective of these town halls is to provide employees an update on Company news, share updates from major business lines, as well as provide a forum to ask questions and offer feedback. Employees are encouraged to participate in the free flow of information and communication and to offer positive and constructive feedback in furtherance of active transparency. \nTraining and Succession Planning\nWe believe that the development of all Cboe employees helps drive our collective success. Through skill and competency development we signal our investment in our employees while also enabling enhanced productivity. Through our tuition reimbursement program, our employees receive financial support in their pursuit of specialized university courses and degrees. In addition to our ongoing offering of online courses on diverse topics through our corporate university, CboeU, employees can participate in our \"Strive for Growth\" programs focused on virtual classroom instruction combined with work application and CboeLive, which is focused on business topics to foster organizational-wide knowledge sharing and education.\nLeadership is another critical element of our success at Cboe. Leaders can participate in Lead the Way, Cboe’s leadership development hybrid program focused on virtual classroom instruction combined with in-person facilitated workshops and exercises, and individual development plans leveraging insights for a 360-feedback process. This leadership training program has helped to expand on the development of our high potential leaders, further strengthening the leadership bench and accelerating readiness of this key talent pool.\n25\nTable \no\nf Contents\nCboe has held multiple succession planning discussions with the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors to plan for the fulfillment of essential roles, such as the CEO and other senior officers. This process includes investments in advanced development planning for targeted successors to accelerate their readiness through key internal projects and assignments as well as tailored training. One of our CEO’s top areas of focus is to develop talent and spend time on succession planning, particularly in light of the executive transitions we experienced in 2023.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed 1,685 individuals in the following locations:\nLocation\nNumber of Employees\nUnited States\n1,113\nUnited Kingdom\n197\nNetherlands\n137\nAustralia\n86\nCanada\n79\nPhilippines\n29\nJapan\n28\nSingapore\n9\nHong Kong\n6\nSwitzerland\n1\nOf these employees, 605 were involved in technology operations and 195 were involved in direct support of trading operations.

Cboe provides trading solutions and products in multiple asset classes, including equities, derivatives, and FX, across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Above all, the Company is committed to building a trusted, inclusive global marketplace that enables people to pursue a sustainable financial future. \nCboe’s subsidiaries include the largest options exchange and the third largest equities exchange operator in the U.S. In addition, the Company operates Cboe Europe, one of the largest equities exchanges by value traded in Europe, and owns Cboe Clear Europe, a leading pan-European equities and derivatives clearinghouse, BIDS Holdings, which owns a leading block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S., and provides block-trading services with Cboe market operators in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan, Cboe Australia, an operator of trading venues in Australia, Cboe Japan, an operator of trading venues in Japan, Cboe Clear U.S., an operator of a regulated clearinghouse, and Cboe Canada Inc., a recognized Canadian securities exchange. Cboe subsidiaries also serve collectively as a leading market globally for exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) listings and trading.  \nOn April 25, 2024, the Company announced plans to refocus the digital asset business to leverage its core strengths in derivatives, technology, and product innovation. On May 31, 2024, the Company halted trading on the Cboe Digital spot market (“Cboe Digital spot market”). The Cboe Digital spot market is closed for all participant and trading purposes. In addition, the Company plans to transition the cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on Cboe Digital Exchange, LLC's Digital Exchange (\"Cboe Digital Exchange\"), to CFE in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review. The Company has brought Cboe Clear U.S. (formerly, Cboe Clear Digital) under unified leadership with the Global Head of Clearing, and expects to continue to facilitate the clearing of cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts.\nThe Company is headquartered in Chicago with offices in Amsterdam, Belfast, Hong Kong, Kansas City, London, Manila, New York, San Francisco, Sarasota Springs, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, and Toronto.\n54\nTable \no\nf Contents\nRecent Developments\nPyth Tokens Unlocking\nIn October 2022, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cboe Netherlands Services Company B.V., entered into a Data Provider Agreement with Pyth Data Association (“Pyth”) to create a data feed and begin publishing limited derived equities market data for certain symbols from one of its four U.S. equities exchanges on the Pyth Network, a decentralized financial market data distribution platform for aggregated data. In exchange, Pyth granted Cboe Netherlands Services Company B.V. 16,666,666 restricted PYTH tokens which unlock annually over a four-year period in equal tranches; the first 25% tranche of PYTH tokens unlocked in May 2024. The PYTH tokens, which are included within intangible assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets, are carried at their historical value of $0.06 per token and are reviewed each reporting period for potential impairment. In May 2024, the Company recorded $1.0 million in market data fees revenue on the consolidated statements of income, which represents the historical value of the grant of 16,666,666 restricted PYTH tokens earned for satisfying the performance obligations outlined in the Data Provider Agreement. The Company has earned additional PYTH tokens by continuing to provide data to the Pyth Network through various Pyth Reward Programs. Through December 31, 2024, the Company earned an additional 725,000 PYTH tokens via the Pyth Reward Programs. The Company recorded additional intangible assets and revenue based on the token fair value when earned.\nSecurities Financing Transactions \nOn November 25, 2024, Cboe Clear Europe announced that it received regulatory approval to clear European SFT. The service supports key regulatory initiatives such as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, Central Securities Depository Regulation, and the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation, thereby promoting transparency, market integrity, and competition in European capital markets. As of December 31, 2024, no SFT trades had occurred on the Cboe Clear Europe platform.\nBusiness Segments \nThe Company operates six reportable business segments: Options, North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific, Futures, Global FX, and Digital, which is reflective of how the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") reviews and operates the business, as discussed in Note 1 (\"Nature of Operations\"). The primary measure of segment performance used by the CODM in assessing segment-level performance and the allocation of resources is operating income (loss). The Company's CODM does not assess assets or income and expenses below operating income (loss) at the segment-level as key performance metrics. The Company has aggregated all of its corporate costs, as well as other business ventures, within the Corporate Items and Eliminations totals based on the decision that those activities should not be used to evaluate the operating performance of the segments; however, operating expenses that relate to activities of a specific segment have been allocated to that segment.\nOptions.\n The Options segment includes options on market indices (“index options”), as well as on the stocks of individual corporations (“equity options”) and on ETPs such as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and exchange-traded notes (“ETNs”), which are “multi-listed” options and listed on a non-exclusive basis. These options are eligible to trade, as applicable, on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and/or other U.S. national security exchanges. Cboe Options is the Company’s primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on the Cboe Options trading floor in Chicago. C2 Options, BZX Options, and EDGX Options are all-electronic options exchanges, and typically operate with different market models and fee structures than Cboe Options. The Options segment also includes applicable market data fees revenues generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary options market data, index licensing, routing services, and access and capacity services.\nNorth American Equities. \nThe North American Equities segment includes U.S. equities and ETP transaction services that occur on fully electronic exchanges owned and operated by BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, equities transactions that occur on the BIDS Trading platform in the U.S. and Canada, and Canadian equities and other transaction services that occur on or through Cboe Canada Inc.’s order books. The North American Equities segment also includes corporate listing services on Cboe Canada Inc., ETP listings on BZX, the Cboe Global Markets, Inc. common stock listing, and applicable market data fees revenues generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary equities market data, routing services, and access and capacity services.\nEurope and Asia Pacific.\n The Europe and Asia Pacific segment includes the pan-European listed equities and derivatives transaction services, ETPs, including exchange traded funds, exchange traded notes, and exchange traded commodities, and international depository receipts that are hosted on MTFs operated by Cboe Europe Equities (Cboe Europe and Cboe NL equities exchanges) and Cboe Europe Derivatives (“CEDX”). It also includes the ETP listings business on RMs and clearing activities of Cboe Clear Europe, as well as the equities transaction services of Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan, operators of trading venues in Australia and Japan, respectively, along with equities transactions that occur on the BIDS Trading platform in Australia and Japan. Cboe Europe operates lit and dark books, a periodic auctions book, a closing cross book, and two BIDS orderbooks; a Large-in-Scale (“LIS”) trading negotiation facility and - predominantly for UK and Swiss symbols - a volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) trajectory crossing facility. Cboe NL, based in Amsterdam, \n55\nTable \no\nf Contents\noperates similar business functionality to that offered by Cboe Europe (with exception of Trajectory Crossing), and provides for trading only in European Economic Area (“EEA”) symbols. Cboe Europe Derivatives, a pan-European derivatives platform, offers futures and options based on Cboe Europe equity indices, and single stock options. Cboe Clear Europe offers the clearing of equity and equity-like instruments for Cboe-operated and other regulated trading venues, the clearing of derivative transactions executed on CEDX, and has recently introduced a service to clear Securities Financing Transactions. This segment also includes Cboe Europe, Cboe NL, CEDX, Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.\nFutures.\n The Futures segment includes transaction services provided by CFE, a fully electronic futures exchange, which includes offerings for trading of VIX futures and other futures products, the licensing of proprietary market data, as well as access and capacity services. On April 25, 2024, the Company announced plans to transition the cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange, to CFE in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review.\nGlobal FX.\n The Global FX segment includes institutional FX trading services that occur on the Cboe FX fully electronic trading platform, non-deliverable forward FX transactions (“NDFs”) offered for execution on Cboe SEF, as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services. The segment includes transaction services for U.S. government securities executed on the Cboe Fixed Income fully electronic trading platform.\nDigital.\n The Digital segment includes a regulated futures exchange (Cboe Digital Exchange) and a regulated clearinghouse (Cboe Clear U.S.), as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services. Prior to May 31, 2024, the Digital segment also included a U.S.-based spot digital asset trading market (“Cboe Digital spot market”). As of May 31, 2024, the Cboe Digital spot market is closed for all participant and trading purposes. In addition, the Company plans to transition the cash-settled margin Bitcoin and Ether futures contracts, currently available for trading on the Cboe Digital Exchange, to CFE in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory review. The Company expects that Digital will cease to be a distinct reportable business segment in the first quarter of 2025.\nGeneral Factors Affecting Results of Operations \nIn broad terms, our business performance is impacted by a number of drivers, including macroeconomic events affecting the risk and return of financial assets, investor sentiment, the regulatory environment for capital markets, geopolitical events, tax policies, central bank policies and changing technology, particularly in the financial services industry. We believe our future revenues and net income will continue to be influenced by a number of domestic and international economic trends, including:\n•\ntrading volumes on our proprietary products such as VIX options and futures and SPX options;\n•\ntrading volumes in listed equity securities, options, futures, and ETPs in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, clearing volumes in listed equity securities, options, futures, and ETPs in Europe and volumes in institutional FX trading; \n•\nthe demand for and pricing structure of the U.S. tape plan market data distributed by the Securities Information Processors (\"SIPs\"), which determines the pool size of the industry market data fees we receive based on our market share;\n•\nconsolidation and expansion of our customers and competitors in the industry; \n•\nthe demand for information about, or access to, our markets and products, which is dependent on the products we trade, our importance as a liquidity center, quality and integrity of our proprietary indices, and the quality and pricing of our data and access and capacity services; \n•\ncontinuing pressure in transaction fee pricing due to intense competition in the North American, European, and Asia Pacific markets;\n•\nsignificant fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates or weakened value of currencies; and\n•\nregulatory changes and obligations relating to market structure, increased capital or margin requirements, and those which affect certain types of instruments, transactions, products, pricing structures, capital market participants or reporting or compliance requirements.\nA number of significant structural, political, monetary, and global conflicts continue to confront the global economy, and instability could continue, resulting in an increased or subdued level of: inflation, market volatility, potential recession, supply chain constraints and costs, trading volumes, uncertainty, expenses, and increased costs and uncertainties related to CAT and the ability to collect on the promissory notes related to the funding of CAT, may have an adverse effect on our financial results.\n56\nTable \no\nf Contents\nComponents of Revenues\nCash and Spot Markets\nRevenue aggregated into cash and spot markets includes associated transaction and clearing fees, the portion of market data fees relating to associated U.S. tape plan market data fees, associated regulatory fees, and associated other revenue from the Company’s North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific, Global FX, and Digital segments. \nData Vantage\nRevenue aggregated into Data Vantage includes access and capacity fees, proprietary market data fees, and associated other revenue across the Company’s six segments. \nDerivatives Markets\nRevenue aggregated into derivatives markets includes associated transaction and clearing fees, the portion of market data fees relating to associated U.S. tape plan market data fees, associated regulatory fees, and associated other fees from the Company’s Options, Futures, Europe and Asia Pacific, and Digital segments. \nComponents of Cost of Revenues\nLiquidity Payments\nLiquidity payments are primarily correlated to the volume of securities traded on our markets. As stated above, we record the liquidity rebates paid to market participants providing liquidity, in the case of Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives, CFE, and Cboe Digital, as cost of revenue. BYX offers an inverted pricing model where we rebate liquidity takers for executing against an order resting on our book, which is also recorded as a cost of revenues. Effective November 1, 2024, EDGA transitioned from an inverted fee model to a maker-taker fee model.\nRouting and Clearing\nVarious rules require that U.S. options and equities trade executions occur at the National Best Bid and Offer displayed by any exchange. Linkage order routing consists of the cost incurred to provide a service whereby Cboe equities and options exchanges deliver orders to other execution venues when there is a potential for obtaining a better execution price or when instructed to directly route an order to another venue by the order provider. The service affords exchange order flow providers an opportunity to obtain the best available execution price and may also result in cost benefits to those clients. Such an offering improves our competitive position and provides an opportunity to attract orders which would otherwise bypass our exchanges. We utilize third-party brokers or our broker-dealer, Cboe Trading, to facilitate such delivery. Also included within routing and clearing are the Order Management System (\"OMS\") and Execution Management System (“EMS”) fees incurred for U.S. Equities Off-Exchange order execution, as well as settlement costs incurred for the settlement process executed by Cboe Clear Europe and Cboe Clear U.S.\nSection 31 Fees\nExchanges under the authority of the SEC (Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA as well as CFE to the extent that CFE offers trading in security futures products) are assessed fees pursuant to the Exchange Act designed to recover the costs to the U.S. government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. We treat these fees as a pass-through charge to customers executing eligible listed equities and listed equity options trades. Accordingly, we recognize the amount that we are charged under Section 31 as a cost of revenues and the corresponding amount that we charge our customers as regulatory transaction fees revenue. Since the regulatory transaction fees recorded in revenues are equal to the Section 31 fees recorded in cost of revenues, there is no impact on our operating income. Cboe Trading, Cboe Europe, Cboe NL, BIDS, Cboe FX, Cboe Australia, Cboe Japan, Cboe Digital, and Cboe Canada Inc. are not U.S. national securities exchanges, and accordingly are not charged Section 31 fees.\nRoyalty Fees and Other Cost of Revenues\nRoyalty fees primarily consist of license fees paid by us for the use of underlying indices in our proprietary products usually based on contracts traded. The Company has licenses with the owners of the S&P 500 Index, S&P 100 Index and certain other S&P indices, FTSE Russell indices, the DJIA, MSCI, and certain other index products. This category also includes fees related to the dissemination of market data related to S&P indices and other products through Cboe Global Indices Feed (“CGIF”).\nOther cost of revenues primarily consists of interest expense from clearing operations, electronic access permit fees and other miscellaneous costs associated with other revenue.\n57\nTable \no\nf Contents\nComponents of Operating Expenses\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits represent our largest expense category and tend to be driven by our staffing requirements, financial performance, and the general dynamics of the employment market. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to employee equity awards. Stock-based compensation can vary depending on the quantity and fair value of the award on the grant date and the related service period.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets purchased, the amortization of purchased and internally developed software, and the amortization of intangible assets.\nTechnology Support Services\nTechnology support services consists primarily of costs related to the maintenance of computer equipment supporting our system architecture, circuits supporting our wide area network, support for production software, operating system license and support fees, fees paid to information vendors for displaying data and off-site system hosting fees.\nProfessional Fees and Outside Services\nProfessional fees and outside services consist primarily of consulting services, which include supplemental staff activities primarily related to systems development and maintenance, legal, regulatory and audit, and tax advisory services, as well as compensation paid to non-employee directors, including stock-based compensation and deferred compensation.\nTravel and Promotional Expenses\nTravel and promotional expenses primarily consist of advertising, costs for special events, sponsorship of industry conferences, options education seminars, and travel-related expenses.\nFacilities Costs\nFacilities costs primarily consist of expenses related to owned and leased properties including rent, maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and telecommunications costs.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAcquisition-related costs relate to acquisitions and other strategic opportunities. The acquisition-related costs include fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors, public relations firms, severance and retention costs, capitalized software and facilities, and other external costs directly related to mergers and acquisitions.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nImpairment of goodwill consists of charges to impair goodwill of our reporting units if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nImpairment of intangible assets consists of charges to impair intangible assets if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses represent costs necessary to support our operations that are not already included in the above categories, including, but not limited to, changes in contingent consideration. \nNon-Operating (Expenses) Income\nIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating and are classified as other (expenses) income. These activities primarily include interest earned on the investing of excess cash, commitment fees and interest expense related to outstanding debt facilities, income and unrealized gains and losses related to investments held in a trust for the Company’s non-qualified retirement and benefit plans, including non-employee director deferred compensation, realized gains related to lease modifications, realized gains related to the Company’s previously \n58\nTable \no\nf Contents\nheld minority investments, income earned related to the Company’s minority investments, equity earnings or losses from our investments in other business ventures, impairment of the Company’s investments, investment establishment costs associated with new business ventures, and gains and losses relating to the dissolution of the Cboe Digital syndication.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following are summaries of changes in financial performance and include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in conjunction with GAAP measures to help evaluate our performance and to help make financial and operational decisions. These non-GAAP financial measures assist management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items management believes do not reflect our underlying operations.\nWe believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency into financial measures used by management and is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating performance. \nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be calculated differently from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. We encourage analysts, investors and other interested parties to use these non-GAAP measures as supplemental information to the GAAP financial measures included herein, including our consolidated financial statements, to enhance their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons. Please see the footnotes below for definitions, additional information, and reconciliations from the closest GAAP measure.\n59\nTable \no\nf Contents\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 \nOverview \nThe following summarizes changes in financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023:\n(1)\nThese are Non-GAAP figures for which reconciliations are provided below (in millions, except percentages, earnings per share, and as noted below).\nYear Ended \nDecember 31,\nIncrease/\n(Decrease) \nPercent\n \nChange\n \n2024\n2023\nTotal revenues\n$\n4,094.5 \n$\n3,773.5 \n$\n321.0 \n9 \n%\nTotal cost of revenues\n2,022.1 \n1,855.5 \n166.6 \n9 \n%\nRevenues less cost of revenues\n2,072.4 \n1,918.0 \n154.4 \n8 \n%\nTotal operating expenses\n974.0 \n860.1 \n113.9 \n13 \n%\nOperating income\n1,098.4 \n1,057.9 \n40.5 \n4 \n%\nOperating margin\n53.0 \n%\n55.2 \n%\n(2.2)\n%\n*\nIncome before income tax provision\n1,083.8 \n1,047.6 \n36.2 \n3 \n%\nIncome tax provision\n318.9 \n286.2 \n32.7 \n11 \n%\nNet income\n$\n764.9 \n$\n761.4 \n$\n3.5 \n0 \n%\nBasic earnings per share\n$\n7.24 \n$\n7.16 \n$\n0.08 \n1 \n%\nDiluted earnings per share\n7.21 \n7.13 \n0.08 \n1 \n%\nEBITDA (1)\n$\n1,237.1 \n$\n1,252.1 \n$\n(15.0)\n(1)\n%\nEBITDA margin (2)\n59.7 \n%\n65.3 \n%\n(5.6)\n%\n*\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n1,351.6 \n$\n1,244.8 \n$\n106.8 \n9 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (3)\n65.2 \n%\n64.9 \n%\n0.3 \n%\n*\nAdjusted earnings (4)\n$\n908.0 \n$\n828.1 \n$\n79.9 \n10 \n%\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding\n105.5 \n106.2 \n(0.7)\n(1)\n%\nAdjusted Diluted earnings per share (5)\n$\n8.61 \n$\n7.80 \n$\n0.81 \n10 \n%\n________________________________________________________\n* Not meaningful\n60\nTable \no\nf Contents\n(1)\nEBITDA is defined as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before acquisition-related costs, change in contingent consideration, loss on minority investments, gain on sale of property held for sale, contra-revenue associated with the Cboe Digital syndication wind down, gain on Cboe Digital non-recourse notes and warrants wind down, impairment of intangible assets, costs related to the Cboe Digital wind down, and income from minority investment. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered as, alternatives to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. We have presented EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we consider them important supplemental measures of our performance and believe that they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. In addition, we use adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance for preparation of our forecasts and evaluating our leverage ratio for the debt to earnings covenant included in our outstanding credit facility. Other companies may calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\n(2)\nEBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues.\n(3)\nAdjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues.\n(4)\nAdjusted earnings is defined as net income adjusted for acquisition-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, gain on Cboe Digital non-recourse notes and warrants wind down, contra-revenue associated with the Cboe Digital syndication wind down, change in contingent consideration, impairment of intangible assets, income from minority investment, loss on minority investments, costs related to the Cboe Digital wind down, gain on sale of property held for sale, certain tax reserve changes, and net income or loss allocated to participating securities, net of the income tax effects of these adjustments. Adjusted earnings does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income or loss, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We have presented adjusted earnings because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and we use it as the basis for monitoring our own core operating financial performance relative to other operators of exchanges. We also believe that it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies. We believe that investors may find this non-GAAP measure useful in evaluating our performance compared to that of peer companies in our industry.

Transaction and clearing fees increased primarily due to pricing changes and shifts in volumes on the Cboe U.S. equities exchanges, a 4% increase in Cboe European equities' matched ADNV, a 72% increase in Cboe Japanese equities' ADNV, and an 11% increase in Cboe Clear Europe's net settlement volume. Other revenue increased primarily due to an increase in interest income attributable to Cboe Clear Europe as a result of the changing interest rate environment, coupled with additional interest earned in accordance with the change in its investment policy. See Note 14 (\"Clearing Operations\") for additional information on Cboe Clear Europe's investment policy.\nData Vantage\nData Vantage revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in access and capacity fees and proprietary market data fees.

Net other revenue increased primarily due to an increase in interest income attributable to Cboe Clear Europe as a result of the changing interest rate environment and additional interest income due to a change in its investment policy. See Note 14 (\"Clearing Operations\") for additional information on Cboe Clear Europe's investment policy. Industry market data fees decreased primarily due to a decrease in U.S. tape plan revenue as a result of a 1% decline in market share on the Cboe U.S. equities exchanges.\nData Vantage\nData Vantage revenues less cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in access and capacity fees and proprietary market data fees. Access and capacity fees increased primarily due to increased logical and physical port fees in the North American Equities, Options, and Europe and Asia Pacific segments driven by increased customer demand. Proprietary market data fees increased primarily due to increases in the Options, North American Equities, and Europe and Asia Pacific segments.\nDerivatives Markets \nDerivatives markets revenues less cost of revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in net transaction and clearing fees, driven by an 8% increase in index options ADV, a 6% increase in multi-listed options RPC, and a 7% increase in Futures ADV, partially offset by an increase in royalty fees due to an increase in trading volumes of licensed products in the Options segment.\n70\nTable \no\nf Contents\nOperating Expenses \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 total operating expenses increased primarily due to the impairment of intangible assets related to the Digital segment recorded in 2024 and increases in compensation and benefits and other expenses, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization compared to the prior period. \nThe following summarizes changes in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended

primarily due to a $14.8 million increase in salaries and wages primarily due to merit and headcount increases, a $10.4 million increase in bonuses primarily due to stronger relative Company performance, a $6.8 million increase in equity compensation as a result of expense reversals related to executive departures in 2023 that did not recur in 2024, and a $6.5 million increase in benefits related to increases in payroll taxes, payroll benefits, and employer retirement contributions, partially offset by a decline in equity compensation expense as a result of a change in the retirement vesting terms for new equity awards.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to decline in amortization under the discounted cash flow method for the intangibles acquired in the Merger as well as a decrease in amortization as a result of the Cboe Digital impairment in the second quarter of 2024.\nTechnology Support Services\nTechnology support services costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in software maintenance, cloud services, market data technology support services, primary data center hosting expenses, and software licenses and subscriptions, partially offset by decreases in purchased hardware and hardware maintenance.\nProfessional Fees and Outside Services\nProfessional and outside services fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in contract services, legal fees, and regulatory costs, partially offset by a decrease in consulting fees.\nTravel and Promotional Expenses\nTravel and promotional expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in marketing expenses driven by the Company’s advertising campaigns and sponsorships as well as an increase in travel expenses.\n71\nTable \no\nf Contents\nFacilities Costs\nFacilities costs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in real estate taxes and utilities, partially offset by an increase in office rent, service costs, and repairs and maintenance.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAcquisition-related costs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative costs and retention-related compensation costs associated with prior acquisitions. \nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nImpairment of intangible assets increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 due to the impairment of intangible assets recognized in the Digital segment in the second quarter of 2024.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the change in contingent consideration related to prior acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense provisions.\nOperating Income \nAs a result of the items above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1,098.4 million, compared to operating income of $1,057.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $40.5 million.\nInterest Expense \nInterest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to repayments on the Term Loan in 2023, which was paid off in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to a one-time true-up of interest earned on available-for-sale securities recorded in 2024, coupled with higher interest rates and cash balances in 2024.\nEarnings on Investments\nEarnings on investments decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease of $10.3 million in the equity earnings on the Company's investment in 7Ridge Investments 3 LP (\"7Ridge Fund\") (which owns Trading Technologies International Inc. (“Trading Technologies”)) recorded in 2024 compared to 2023. \nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nOther (expense) income, net decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to a $16.0 million impairment charge on the Company's minority investment in Globacap Technology Limited recorded in the second quarter of 2024, coupled with a $10.5 million impairment charge on the Company's minority investment in Eris Innovations Holdings, LLC recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024, partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in dividend income related to the Company's minority investment in Vest Group Inc. (\"Vest\") in 2024.\nIncome Before Income Tax Provision \nAs a result of the above, income before income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1,083.8 million compared to income before income tax provision of $1,047.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $36.2 million.\n72\nTable \no\nf Contents\nIncome Tax Provision\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the income tax provision was $318.9 million compared to $286.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $32.7 million, primarily due to an increase in income before income tax provision and Section 199 releases in 2023. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 29.4%, compared to a rate of 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The higher effective tax rate in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily due to Section 199 releases in 2023.\nNet Income \nAs a result of the items above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $764.9 million, or 37% of revenues less cost of revenues, compared to $761.4 million, or 40% of revenues less cost of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $3.5 million.\n73\nTable \no\nf Contents\nSegment Operating Results \nWe report results from our six segments: Options, North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific, Futures, Global FX, and Digital.

Operating expenses increased $69.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to the impairment of intangible assets, partially offset by decreases in depreciation and amortization and compensation and benefits.\n79\nTable \no\nf Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nBelow are charts that reflect elements of our capital allocation:\nWe expect our cash on hand at December 31, 2024 and other available resources, including cash generated from operations, to be sufficient to continue to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. In the near term, we expect that our cash from operations and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, and potentially participating in future financing transactions to obtain additional capital will meet our cash needs to fund our operations, capital expenditures, interest payments on debt, any dividends, potential strategic acquisitions, and opportunities for common stock repurchases under the previously announced program. See Note 12 (\"Debt\") and Note 25 (\"Subsequent Events\") to the consolidated financial statements for further information. \nCboe Clear Europe also has a €1.20 billion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility agreement with Cboe Clear Europe as borrower and the Company as guarantor of scheduled interest and fees on borrowings (but not the principal amount of any borrowings) (the “Facility”). The Facility is available to be drawn by Cboe Clear Europe towards (a) financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through Cboe Clear Europe’s clearing system and (b) financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of Cboe Clear Europe incurred in the operation of its clearing system. Borrowings under the Facility are secured by cash, eligible bonds and eligible equity assets deposited by Cboe Clear Europe into secured accounts. As a result, should the Facility be drawn by Cboe Clear Europe it could potentially impact Cboe Clear Europe’s liquidity, and we can give no assurance that this Facility will be sufficient to meet all of such obligations or sufficiently mitigate Cboe Clear Europe’s liquidity risk to meet its payment obligations when due. Additionally, a default of the Facility may allow lenders, under certain circumstances, to accelerate any related drawn amounts and may result in the acceleration of the Company’s other outstanding debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which may limit the Company’s liquidity, business and financing activities. The Facility was amended on June 27, 2024, which extended the term of the facility through June 28, 2025. Please refer to Note 12 (\"Debt\") for further information.\nOur long-term cash needs will depend on many factors, including an introduction of new products, enhancements of current products, capital needs of our subsidiaries, the geographic mix of our business and any potential acquisitions. We believe our cash from operations and the availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will meet any long-term needs unless a significant acquisition or acquisitions are identified, in which case we expect that we would be able to borrow the necessary funds and/or issue additional shares of our common stock to complete such acquisition(s).\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and all non-restricted, highly liquid investments, including short-term repurchase agreements, with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 increased $377.1 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to the results of operations and proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale financial investments, partially offset by outflows from cash dividends, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of available-for-sale financial investments, purchases of property and equipment, and contributions to investments. See “Cash Flow” below for further discussion.\n80\nTable \no\nf Contents\nOur cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States in various foreign subsidiaries totaled $301.3 million and $244.3 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining balance was held in the United States and totaled $619.0 million and $298.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, but under current law, could subject us to additional United States income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits.\nOur financial investments include deferred compensation plan assets, as well as investments with original or acquired maturities longer than three months but that mature in less than one year from the balance sheet date, and are recorded at fair value. As of December 31, 2024, financial investments primarily consisted of U.S. Treasury securities and deferred compensation plan assets.\nCash Flow\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 (in millions):\n \nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,100.6 \n$\n1,075.6 \n$\n651.1 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(141.8)\n(55.1)\n(835.1)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n(495.0)\n(656.1)\n81.7 \nEffect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents\n(95.1)\n52.8 \n(10.0)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents\n$\n368.7 \n$\n417.2 \n$\n(112.3)\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nReconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n915.3 \n$\n543.2 \n$\n432.7 \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents (included in margin deposits, clearing funds, and interoperability funds)\n841.4 \n834.8 \n530.3 \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents (included in cash and cash equivalents)\n5.0 \n— \n— \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents (included in other current assets)\n— \n5.1 \n4.2 \nCustomer bank deposits (included in margin deposits, clearing funds, and interoperability funds)\n4.1 \n14.0 \n12.7 \nTotal\n$\n1,765.8 \n$\n1,397.1 \n$\n979.9 \nNet Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $335.7 million higher than net income. The variance is primarily attributable to the adjustment for depreciation and amortization of $133.0 million, the change in Section 31 fees payable of $130.1 million, the adjustment for impairment of intangible assets of $81.0 million, the change in margin deposits, clearing funds, and interoperability funds related to Cboe Clear Europe and customer bank deposits of $76.0 million, and the change in unrecognized tax benefits of $61.2 million, partially offset by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $124.3 million and $36.4 million, respectively. \nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,100.6 million and $1,075.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the change in Section 31 fees payable, the adjustment for impairment of intangible assets, the change in other assets, the adjustment for impairment of investments, and the change in income taxes receivable. This was partially offset by changes in margin deposits, clearing funds, and interoperability funds, accounts receivable, and the adjustments for depreciation and amortization.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $314.2 million higher than net income for the year ended December 31, 2023. The variance is primarily attributable to the change in margin deposits, clearing funds, and interoperability funds related to Cboe Clear Europe of $282.6 million and the adjustment for depreciation and amortization expense of $158.0 million, partially offset by the change in Section 31 fees payable of $95.2 million.\n81\nTable \no\nf Contents\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,075.6 million and $651.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The change in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the change in net income, the change in margin deposits, clearing funds, and interoperability funds related to Cboe Clear Europe, and the change in benefit for deferred income taxes, partially offset by the adjustment for impairment of goodwill and the change in Section 31 fees payable.\nNet Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of purchases of available-for-sale financial investments of $115.6 million, purchases of property and equipment and leasehold improvements of $60.9 million, and contributions to investments of $40.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale financial investments of $67.9 million. \nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $141.8 million and $55.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The variance is primarily due to the change in proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale financial investments, purchases of available-for-sale financial investments, and purchases of property and equipment and leasehold improvements, partially offset by the change in contributions to investments for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of purchases of available-for-sale financial investments of $89.8 million, contributions to investments of $57.1 million, and purchases of property and equipment and leasehold improvements of $45.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale financial investments of $135.7 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $708.3 million, purchases of available-for-sale financial investments of $104.7 million, and purchases of property and equipment and leasehold improvements of $59.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of available-for-sale financial investments of $51.2 million.\nNet Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of cash dividends on common stock of $249.4 million and share repurchases of $204.8 million.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $495.0 million and $656.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The variance is primarily due to the change in principal payments of the current portion of long-term debt, partially offset by the change in share repurchases.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities totaled $656.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and primarily consisted of principal payments of the current portion of long-term debt of $305.0 million, cash dividends on common stock of $223.5 million, and share repurchases of $83.9 million.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $81.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and primarily consisted of proceeds from long-term debt issuance of $663.6 million, partially offset by principal payments of long-term debt of $220.0 million, cash dividends on common stock, share repurchases, and payments of contingent consideration related to acquisitions.\n82\nTable \no\nf Contents\nFinancial Assets\nThe following summarizes our financial assets excluding margin deposits, clearing funds, and interoperability funds as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n920.3 \n$\n543.2 \n$\n432.7 \nFinancial investments\n110.3 \n57.5 \n91.7 \nLess deferred compensation plan assets\n(40.3)\n(36.7)\n(27.5)\nLess cash collected for Section 31 fees\n(110.8)\n(30.5)\n(93.7)\nAdjusted cash (1)\n$\n879.5 \n$\n533.5 \n$\n403.2 \n________________________________________________________\n(1)\nAdjusted cash is a non-GAAP measure and represents cash and cash equivalents plus financial investments, minus deferred compensation plan assets and cash collected for Section 31 fees. We have presented adjusted cash because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our liquidity and believe that it is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies.\nDebt\nThe following summarizes our debt obligations as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTerm Loan Agreement\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n305.0 \n3.650% Senior Notes\n650.0 \n650.0 \n650.0 \n1.625% Senior Notes\n500.0 \n500.0 \n500.0 \n3.000% Senior Notes\n300.0 \n300.0 \n300.0 \nRevolving Credit Agreement\n— \n— \n— \nCboe Clear Europe Credit Facility\n— \n— \n— \nLess unamortized discount and debt issuance costs\n(9.0)\n(10.8)\n(13.0)\nTotal debt\n$\n1,441.0 \n$\n1,439.2 \n$\n1,742.0 \nAt December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements. \nIn addition to the debt outstanding, as of December 31, 2024, we had an additional $400 million available through our revolving credit facility, with the ability to borrow another $200 million by increasing the commitments under the facility, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders. Together, with adjusted cash, we had approximately $1.3 billion available to fund our operations, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, debt repayments and any dividends, net of minimum regulatory capital requirements of $166.7 million\n, \nwhich are subject to potential applicable regulatory restrictions and approvals and potential associated tax costs, as of December 31, 2024. \nDividends\nThe Company’s expectation is to continue to pay dividends. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, and other considerations our Board of Directors deems relevant. Future debt obligations and statutory provisions, among other things, may limit or, in some cases, prohibit our ability to pay dividends.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn 2011, the Board of Directors approved an initial authorization for the Company to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock of $100 million and subsequently approved additional authorizations, for a total authorization of $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2024. The program permits the Company to purchase shares through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws. It does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at any specific time or situation. Share repurchases are repurchased to the Company’s Treasury stock and ultimately retired or they are available to be redistributed. \nUnder the program, for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 1,148,295 shares of common stock at an average cost per share of $177.86, totaling $204.3 million. Since inception of the program through December 31, \n83\nTable \no\nf Contents\n2024, the Company has repurchased 20,758,383 shares of common stock at an average cost per share of $78.05, totaling $1.6 billion. The Company retired 1,332,430 and 2,453,428 shares of treasury stock in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As a result of these repurchases, certain direct costs and excise taxes are incurred but do not impact our cost per share or availability. See Note 2 (\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\") for more information.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had $679.8 million of availability remaining under its existing share repurchase authorizations. \nLease and Obligations\nThe Company currently leases additional office space, data centers and remote network operations center, with lease terms remaining from 2 months to 128 months as of December 31, 2024.\nTotal rent expense related to current and former lease obligations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 totaled $37.1 million, $34.5 million, and $30.0 million, respectively. In addition to our lease obligations, we have contractual obligations related to certain operating leases, data and telecommunications agreements, and our long-term debt outstanding. \nPurchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed or minimum and maximum amounts to be paid; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include certain licensing agreements with various licensors which contain annual minimum fee requirements as well as payments calculated using agreed upon contract rates and reported cleared volumes. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty. \nWe have excluded from the contractual obligations listed below $845.5 million in margin deposits, clearing funds, and interoperability funds related to Cboe Clear Europe and Cboe Clear U.S. Clearing participants of Cboe Clear Europe are required to make deposits to a clearing fund. The cash deposits made by clearing participants are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as current assets with equal and offsetting current liabilities. See Note 14 (\"Clearing Operations\") to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on Cboe Clear Europe and Cboe Clear U.S. and the margin deposits, clearing funds, and interoperability funds. \nFuture minimum payments under these leases and agreements were as follows as of December 31, 2024:\nPayments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations\nTotal\nLess than\n1 year\nMore than\n1 year\nOperating leases\n$\n183.4 \n$\n25.5 \n$\n157.9 \nPurchase obligations\n856.2 \n87.0 \n769.2 \nPrincipal payments of debt\n1,450.0 \n— \n1,450.0 \nInterest payments on debt\n520.8 \n40.9 \n479.9 \nTotal\n$\n3,010.4 \n$\n153.4 \n$\n2,857.0 \nCommercial Commitments and Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2024, our commercial commitments and contractual obligations included operating leases, data and telecommunications agreements, equipment leases, our long-term debt outstanding, contingent considerations, software development activities and other obligations. See Note 23 (\"Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees\") to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of commitments and contingencies, Note 12 (\"Debt\") for a discussion of the outstanding debt, Note 14 (\"Clearing Operations\") for information on Cboe Clear Europe and Cboe Digital’s clearinghouse exposure guarantees, and Note 24 (\"Leases\") for discussion on operating leases and equipment leases.\nGuarantees \nWe use Wedbush and Morgan Stanley to clear our routed equities transactions for our U.S. equities exchanges. Wedbush and Morgan Stanley guarantee the trade until the trade has been submitted to and validated by the National Securities Clearing Corporation (\"NSCC\"), after which time NSCC provides a guarantee until the trade settles. Thus, Cboe Trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to an equity trade routed to another market center until the trade has been processed and validated by the NSCC on the trade date. The BIDS Trading ATS platform delivers matched trades to BofA Securities, Inc. (“BOA”), which delivers the matched trades to the NSCC. BOA guarantees the trade until one day after the trade date, after which time the NSCC provides a guarantee until the trade settles. In the case of failure to perform on the part of Wedbush or Morgan Stanley on routed transactions for our U.S. Equities exchanges, we provide the guarantee to the counterparty to the trader. In the case of failure to perform on the part of BOA on transactions for the BIDS Trading ATS platform, BIDS has obligations to the counterparties to satisfy the trades. \n84\nTable \no\nf Contents\nOCC acts as a central counterparty on all transactions in listed equity options in our Options segment, and as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our options transactions. We believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and accordingly, have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees. Similarly, with respect to trades in U.S. listed equity options and futures occurring on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and CFE, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the OCC, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on these exchanges and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of those matched options and futures trades. With respect to U.S. government securities transactions executed on Cboe Fixed Income, we use Mirae Asset Securities (USA) Inc. to deliver matched trades to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) Government Securities Division (GSD), which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Fixed Income and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of those matched trades.\nWith respect to Canadian equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to The Canadian Depository for Securities, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Canada Inc. and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched Canadian equities trades. With respect to trades in options and futures occurring on Cboe Europe Derivatives, we deliver matched trades of our customers to Cboe Clear Europe, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Europe Derivatives and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of those matched options and futures trades. With respect to Australian equities and derivatives, we deliver matched trades of our customers to ASX Clear Pty Ltd and ASX Settlement Pty Ltd. ASX Clear Pty Ltd acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Australia and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in Australia. With respect to Japanese equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the Japanese Securities Clearing Corporation, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Japan and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in Japan.\nWith respect to trades in digital asset futures occurring on Cboe Digital Exchange, we deliver matched trades of our customers to Cboe Clear U.S., which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Digital Exchange and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of those matched futures trades.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of the amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, observance of trends in particular areas, information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources.\nWe have identified the estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these estimates on our business operations is discussed throughout \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" For a detailed discussion on these estimates and other accounting policies, see Note 2 (\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\") to the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nDescription\n \nOur acquisitions of Bats, Silexx Financial Systems, LLC (“Silexx”), Livevol, Inc. (“LiveVol”), Hanweck, FT Options, Trade Alert, BIDS Holdings, Cboe Asia Pacific, Cboe Digital, and Cboe Canada Inc. resulted in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, while our acquisition of Cboe Clear Europe, resulted in a bargain purchase gain and other intangible assets. In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350 – Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, we test the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances signal indicators of impairment are present.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nThe estimated fair values of our reporting units are based on the market approach and the income approach (using discounted estimated future cash flows). The estimated fair values of indefinite-lived intangibles are based on the cost method and income approach. The discounted estimated future cash flow analysis requires judgments about the discount rate, forecasted revenue growth rate, and operating expenses, that are inherent in these fair value estimates over the estimated remaining operating period. Additionally, the analysis contains uncertainty surrounding future events. As such, actual results may differ from these estimates and lead to a revaluation of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and/or our reporting units.\n85\nTable \no\nf Contents\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nIf updated estimates indicate that the fair value of goodwill or any indefinite-lived intangibles is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is expected to be recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change in estimate, which could result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. \nFollowing the April 2024 announcement of the Cboe Digital spot market wind down and unwinding of the minority ownership structure in the holding company parent of the Cboe Digital entities, the Company performed an interim impairment test for the intangible assets recognized in the Digital reporting unit as the announcement was considered a potential indication of impairment. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trading registrations and licenses and technology exceeded their estimated fair value, as their projected future cash flows, subsequent to the decision to wind down the business, did not support their valuation, and recorded an impairment charge of $81.0 million in the consolidated statements of income during the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nAs a result of the Company’s annual impairment analysis, in which the Company’s reporting units estimated fair values were substantially in excess of their carrying values, we do not consider our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles to have a significant risk of additional impairment at December 31, 2024.\nIncome Taxes \nDescription\nThe Company’s consolidated global income tax provision, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are determined through the interpretation of tax laws and assumptions of future events to calculate an expectation of future tax consequences. \nJudgments and Uncertainties\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its tax estimates and judgments. This evaluation is based on factors including historical experience, such as the conclusions of examinations by tax authorities, changes in tax laws or rates, new examination activity, and results of any related legal processes. We use judgment in the evaluation of uncertain tax positions and the estimation of unrecognized tax benefits when determining the largest amount greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority, assessing the likelihood of the benefit being realized upon settlement, and calculating the expected ultimate settlement amount. \nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nSignificant changes in these estimates or judgments may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a future period. Additionally, it is possible that the ultimate settlement may differ from the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits currently reported if tax authorities ultimately reach a conclusion that differs from the Company’s expectation. We believe assumptions made regarding income taxes to be reasonable and do not believe any change in the judgments made by management would result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 3 (\"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\") to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the Company\n.",
