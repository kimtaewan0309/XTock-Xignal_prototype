(Con Edison), incorporated in New York State in 1997, is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (CECONY), Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R) and Con Edison Transmission, Inc. As used in this report, the term the “Companies” refers to Con Edison and CECONY, and the term the “Utilities” refers to CECONY and O&R.  \nCon Edison\nCECONY\nO&R\nCon Edison Transmission\n•\nRECO\nCon Edison’s principal business operations are those of CECONY, O&R and Con Edison Transmission. CECONY’s principal business operations are its regulated electric, gas and steam delivery businesses. O&R’s principal business operations are its regulated electric and gas delivery businesses. Con Edison Transmission, through its subsidiaries, invests in electric transmission projects and manages, through joint ventures, both electric and gas assets while seeking to develop electric transmission projects. Con Edison Transmission is considering strategic alternatives with respect to its investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP) and both Con Edison Transmission and CECONY are considering strategic alternatives with respect to their investments in Honeoye Storage Corporation (Honeoye). See “Con Edison Transmission” in Item 1. \nCon Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and electric transmission projects. The company invests to provide reliable, resilient, safe and clean energy critical for its New York and New Jersey customers. Con Edison is a responsible neighbor, helping the communities it serves become more sustainable.\nCECONY\nElectric\nCECONY provides electric service to approximately \n3.7\n million customers in all of New York City (except a part of Queens) and most of Westchester County, an approximately 660 square mile service area with a population of more than nine million.\nGas\nCECONY delivers gas to approximately \n1.1\n million customers in Manhattan, the Bronx, parts of Queens and most of Westchester County.\nSteam\nCECONY operates the largest steam distribution system in the United States by producing and delivering approximat\nely 15,494 MMlb of \nsteam annually to approximately \n1,520\n customers in parts of Manhattan.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n15\n                      \nO&R\nElectric\nO&R and its utility subsidiary, Rockland Electric Company (RECO) (together referred to herein as O&R) provide electric service to approximately \n0.3\n million customers in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey, an approximately 1,300 square mile service area.\nGas\nO&R delivers gas to over \n0.1\n million customers in southeastern New York.\nCon Edison Transmission \nCon Edison Transmission, through its subsidiaries, invests in electric transmission projects and manages, through joint ventures, both electric and gas assets while seeking to develop electric transmission projects. Con Edison Transmission is considering strategic alternatives with respect to its investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP) and both Con Edison Transmission and CECONY are considering strategic alternatives with respect to their investments in Honeoye Storage Corporation (Honeoye). See “Con Edison Transmission,” below. \nUtility Regulation\nState Utility Regulation\nRegulators\nThe Utilities are subject to regulation by the NYSPSC, that under the New York Public Service Law, is authorized to set the terms of service and the rates the Utilities charge for providing service in New York. See “Rate Plans,” below and in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The NYSPSC also approves the issuance of the Utilities’ securities and transactions between the Utilities and Con Edison and its other subsidiaries. See “Capital Resources,” below and Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. The NYSPSC exercises jurisdiction over the siting of electric transmission lines in New York State (see “Con Edison Transmission,” below) and approves mergers or other business combinations involving New York utilities. \nIn addition, under the New York Public Service Law, the NYSPSC has the authority to (i) impose penalties on New York utilities, which could be material, for violating state utility laws and regulations and its orders; (ii) review, at least every five years, an electric and gas utility’s capability to provide safe, adequate and reliable service, order the utility to comply with additional and more stringent terms of service than existed prior to the review, assess the continued operation of the utility as the provider of electric service in its service territory and propose, and act upon, such measures as are necessary to ensure safe and adequate service; and (iii) based on findings of repeated violations of the New York Public Service Law or rules or regulations adopted thereto that demonstrate a failure of a combination gas and electric utility to continue to provide safe and adequate service, revoke or modify an operating certificate issued to the utility by the NYSPSC (following consideration of certain factors, including public interest and standards deemed necessary by the NYSPSC to ensure continuity of service, and due process). See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A and “Other Regulatory Matters” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. O&R’s New Jersey subsidiary, RECO, is subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU). The NYSPSC, together with the NJBPU, are referred to herein as state utility regulators.\nNew York Utility Industry \nRestructuring in the 1990s\nIn the 1990s, the NYSPSC restructured the electric utility industry in the state. In accordance with NYSPSC orders, the Utilities sold all of their electric generating facilities other than those that also produce steam for CECONY’s steam business (see \"Electric Operations – Electric Facilities,\" below) and provided all of their customers the choice to buy electricity or gas from the Utilities or other suppliers \n(see \"Electric Operations – Electric Sales and Deliveries\" and \"Gas Operations – Gas Sales and Deliveries,\" below). In 2024, 58 percent of the electricity and 32 percent of the gas CECONY delivered to its customers, and 46 percent of the electricity and 21 percent of the\n gas O&R delivered to its customers, was purchased by the customers from other suppliers. In addition, the Utilities no longer control or operate their bulk power electric transmission facilities. See “New York Independent System Operator (NYISO),” below.\nFollowing industry restructuring, there were several utility mergers as a result of which substantially all of the electric and gas delivery service in New York State is now provided by one of five investor-owned utility companies – Con Edison, National Grid plc, Avangrid, Inc. (an affiliate of Iberdrola, S.A.), National Fuel Gas Company or CH Energy Group, Inc. (a subsidiary of Fortis Inc.) – or one of two state authorities – New York Power Authority (NYPA) or Long Island Power Authority.\n16\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nRate Plans\nInvestor-owned utilities in the United States provide delivery service to customers according to the terms of tariffs approved by the appropriate state utility regulator. The tariffs include schedules of rates for service that limit the rates charged by the utilities to amounts that the utilities recover from their customers for costs approved by the regulator, including capital costs, of providing service to customers as defined by the tariff. The tariffs implement rate plans adopted by state utility regulators in rate orders issued at the conclusion of rate proceedings. The utilities’ earnings depend on the limits on rates authorized in, and the other provisions of, their rate plans and their ability to operate their businesses in a manner consistent with such rate plans.\nThe utilities’ rate plans cover specified periods, but rates determined pursuant to a plan generally continue in effect until a new rate plan is approved by the state utility regulator. In New York, either the utility or the NYSPSC can commence a proceeding for a new rate plan, and a new rate plan filed by the utility will generally take effect automatically in approximately 11 months unless prior to such time the NYSPSC approves a rate plan. The NYSPSC may request that the utility agree to suspend its request for new rates beyond the 11-month period, but if the utility agrees then the NYSPSC typically allows the utility to recover its new rates as if they went into effect at the 11-month date.\nIn each rate proceeding, rates are determined by the state utility regulator following the submission by the utility of testimony and supporting information, which are subject to review by the staff of the regulator. Other parties with an interest in the proceeding can also review the utility’s proposal and become involved in the rate proceeding. In New York State, the review process is overseen by an administrative law judge who is employed by the NYSPSC. After an administrative law judge issues a recommended decision that generally considers the interests of the utility, the regulatory staff, other parties and legal requisites, the regulator will issue a rate order. The utility and the regulator’s staff and interested parties may enter jointly into a proposed settlement agreement prior to the completion of this administrative process, in which case the agreement could be approved by the regulator with or without modification.\nFor each rate plan, the revenues needed to provide the utility a return on invested capital is determined by multiplying the utilities’ rate base by the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital determined in the rate plan. In general, rate base, as reflected in a utility's rate plans, is the sum of the utility’s net plant, working capital and certain regulatory assets less deferred taxes and certain regulatory liabilities. The NYSPSC uses a forecast of the average rate base for the year that new rates would be in effect (rate year). The NJBPU uses the rate base balances that exist at the end of the historical 12-month period on which base rates are set. The capital structure used in the weighted average cost of capital is determined using actual and forecast data for the same time periods as rate base. The costs of long-term debt, customer deposits and the allowed return on common equity represent a combination of actual and forecast financing information. The allowed return on common equity is determined by each state’s respective utility regulator. The NYSPSC’s current methodology for determining the allowed return on common equity assigns a one-third weight to an estimate determined from a capital asset pricing model applied to a peer group of utility companies and a two-thirds weight to an estimate determined from a dividend discount model using stock prices and dividend forecasts for a peer group of utility companies. Both methodologies employ market measurements of equity capital to estimate returns rather than the accounting measurements to which such estimates are applied in setting rates.\nPursuant to the Utilities’ rate plans, there generally can be no change to the rates charged to customers during the respective terms of the rate plans other than specified adjustments provided for in the rate plans.\nFor information about the Utilities’ rate plans, see Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.\nLiability for Service Interruptions\nThe tariff provisions under which CECONY provides electric, gas and steam service, and O&R provides electric and gas service, limit each company’s liability to pay for damages resulting from service interruptions to circumstances resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Under RECO's tariff provisions for electric service, the company is not liable for interruptions that are due to causes beyond its control.\nCECONY’s and O&R’s tariffs for electric and gas service also provide for compensation to residential and small business customers that experience widespread prolonged outages lasting more than seventy-two consecutive hours, subject to certain exceptions, including: for residential customers, a bill credit of $25 for each twenty-four hour period of service outage beyond the first seventy-two consecutive hour outage; for residential and small business customers, reimbursement for food spoilage of up to $540; and reimbursement of affected residential customers for prescription medicine spoilage losses without limitation. Any such costs incurred by utilities are not recoverable from customers. Utilities may petition the NYSPSC to request a waiver of the requirement that it compensate customers after widespread prolonged outages. CECONY’s electric tariff requires it to also \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n17\n                      \ncompensate customers for certain other service outages resulting from malfunctions in the company’s lines and cable of 33 kV or less or associated equipment, including, for residential customers, up to $580 for food spoilage and actual losses for prescription medicine losses, and for all other customers, up to $11,460 for losses of perishable merchandise.\nThe NYSPSC has approved a scorecard for use as a guide to assess electric utility performance in restoring electric service during outages that result from a major storm. The scorecard could also be applied by the NYSPSC for other outages or actions. The scorecard includes performance metrics in categories for preparation, operations response, and communications.\nEach New York electric utility is required to submit to the NYSPSC annually an emergency response plan for the reasonably prompt restoration of service in the case of widespread outages in the utility’s service territory due to storms or other events beyond the control of the utility. If, after evidentiary hearings or other investigatory proceedings, the NYSPSC finds that the utility failed to reasonably implement its plan during an event, the NYSPSC may impose penalties or deny recovery of any part of the service restoration costs caused by such failure. In April 2024, the NYSPSC approved CECONY’s and O&R's emergency response plans. In December 2024, CECONY and O&R each submitted updated emergency response plans for 2025. \nGeneric Proceedings\nThe NYSPSC from time to time conducts “generic” proceedings to consider issues relating to all electric and gas utilities operating in New York State. Proceedings include clean energy and related implementation proceedings, such as the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act proceeding, and proceedings relating to energy affordability, data access, retail access, gas planning, energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, and negative revenue adjustments for billing delays related to community solar generation projects. The Utilities typically are active participants in such proceedings.\nFederal Regulation \nIn January 2025, a series of executive orders and presidential memoranda were issued (collectively, Presidential Actions) designed to address areas such as environmental and energy regulations and domestic energy production, among other things. The Companies are monitoring these actions closely in an effort to understand any potential impact on the Companies. The Companies are unable to predict changes in regulations, regulatory guidance, legal interpretations, policy positions and implementation actions that may result from the Presidential Actions.\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), among other things, regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce and the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. In addition, the FERC can impose substantial penalties, including penalties for violations of reliability and cybersecurity rules. Certain activities of the Utilities and Con Edison Transmission are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Utilities are subject to regulation by the FERC with respect to electric transmission rates and to regulation by the NYSPSC with respect to electric and gas retail commodity sales and local delivery service. As a matter of practice, the NYSPSC has approved delivery service rates for the Utilities that include both transmission and distribution costs. The FERC also authorizes the Utilities' short-term borrowings. The electric and gas transmission projects in which Con Edison Transmission invests are also subject to regulation by the FERC. See “Con Edison Transmission,” below.\n18\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nNew York Independent System Operator (NYISO)\nThe NYISO is a not-for-profit organization that controls and directs the operation of most of the electric transmission facilities in New York State, including those of the Utilities, as an integrated system. It also administers wholesale markets for electricity in New York State and facilitates the construction of new transmission it considers necessary to meet identified reliability, economic or public policy needs. The New York State Reliability Council (NYSRC) promulgates reliability standards subject to FERC oversight, and the NYISO has agreed to comply with those standards. Pursuant to a requirement that is set annually by the NYSRC, the NYISO requires that entities supplying electricity to customers in New York State have generating capacity (owned, procured through the NYISO capacity markets or contracted for) in an amount equal to the peak demand of their customers plus the applicable reserve margin. In addition, the NYISO has determined that entities that serve customers in New York City must procure sufficient capacity from resources that are electrically located in New York City to cover a substantial percentage of the peak demands of their New York City customers. The NYISO also requires entities that serve customers in the Lower Hudson Valley and New York City customers that are served through the Lower Hudson Valley to procure sufficient capacity from resources electrically located in the Lower Hudson Valley. These requirements apply both to regulated utilities such as CECONY and O&R for the customers they supply under regulated tariffs and to other load serving entities that supply customers on market terms. See “CECONY – Electric Operations – Electric Supply” and “O&R – Electric Operations – Electric Supply,” below. \nCyber Regulation\nThe Companies are subject to cyber regulation by federal agencies, including FERC, the Transportation Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The Utilities are subject to cyber regulation by the NYSPSC, that under the New York Public Service Law, is authorized to evaluate annually the utility’s customer privacy protections, including, but not limited to, customer electric and gas consumption data, and protection of critical energy infrastructure. In March 2023, the New York State legislature amended the New York State Public Service Law, directing the NYSPSC to develop rules to direct electric and gas utilities to, among other things, (i) protect customer privacy, including customer consumption data, from unauthorized disclosure; (ii) develop and implement tools to monitor operational control networks to detect unauthorized network behavior; and (iii) mandate that utilities’ emergency response plans include cyberattack response plans. In December 2024, the NYSPSC and the NYSDPS prepared a report on their review of New York gas and electric utilities’ compliance with the New York Public Service Law referenced above and their cybersecurity posture for operational and informational technology systems that manage operations and hold private customer data. The NYSPSC recommended adoption of specific cybersecurity regulations to enhance and codify standards and practices in these areas, which will be developed and implemented in a future proceeding.  O&R’s subsidiary, RECO, is subject to cyber regulation by the NJBPU. See “The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And May Be Subject To Penalties” and \"A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect the Companies\" in Item 1A and Item 1C: Cybersecurity.  \nCompetition\nThe subset of distributed energy resources (DER) that produce electricity is collectively called distributed generation (DG). DG includes solar energy production facilities, fuel cells, and micro-turbines, and provides an alternative source of electricity for the Utilities’ electric delivery customers. Energy storage, though not a form of DG, is also a source of electricity for the Utilities’ electric delivery customers. Typically, customers with DG remain connected to the utility’s delivery system and do not pay a different rate. Gas delivery customers have electricity, oil and propane as alternatives, and steam customers have electricity, oil and natural gas as alternative sources for heating and cooling their buildings. Micro-grids and community-based micro-grids enable DG to serve multiple locations and multiple customers. Demand reduction and energy efficiency investments provide ways for energy consumers within the Utilities’ service areas to lower their energy usage. The Companies expect DERs and electric alternatives to gas and steam, to increase, and for gas and steam usage to decrease, as the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) enacted by New York State and the Climate Mobilization Act enacted by New York City continue to be implemented. See “Environmental Matters – Clean Energy Future,” below. CECONY’s smart solutions for gas customers include energy efficiency and heating electrification programs. See “CECONY- Gas Operations - Gas Peak Demand,” below. The following table shows the aggregate capacities of the DG projects connected to the Utilities’ distribution systems at the end of the last five years:\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n19\n                      \nTechnology\nCECONY\nO&R\nTotal MW, except project number\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nInternal-combustion engines\n175 \n160 \n157 \n155 \n146 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n3 \n3 \nPhotovoltaic solar\n680 \n579 \n487 \n398 \n327 \n283 \n243 \n213 \n183 \n154 \nBattery energy storage\n90 \n47 \n25 \n18 \n13 \n49 \n36 \n25 \n11 \n6 \nGas turbines\n61 \n61 \n61 \n61 \n60 \n20 \n20 \n20 \n20 \n20 \nMicro turbines\n25 \n24 \n24 \n23 \n21 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \n1 \nFuel cells\n47 \n46 \n45 \n30 \n30 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nSteam turbines\n6 \n6 \n6 \n6 \n6 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nLandfill \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n2 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n2 \nTotal distribution-level DG\n1,085 \n924 \n805 \n692 \n606 \n358 \n305 \n264 \n220 \n186 \nNumber of DG projects\n75,845 \n65,292 \n53,131 \n43,507 \n36,192 \n15,849 \n14,201 \n12,448 \n10,913 \n9,643 \nThe Utilities do not consider it reasonably likely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery service of electricity, gas or steam where the Utilities already provide service. Any such other company would need to obtain NYSPSC consent, satisfy applicable local requirements, install facilities to provide the service, meet applicable services standards and charge customers comparable taxes and other fees and costs imposed on the service. A new delivery company would also be subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the NYSPSC. See “Utility Regulation – State Utility Regulation – Regulators,” above, \"The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And May Be Subject To Substantial Penalties\" in Item 1A and “Other Regulatory Matters” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison Transmission invests in electric transmission projects and manages both electric and gas assets while seeking to develop electric transmission projects, the current and prospective customers of which may have competitive alternatives. See \"Con Edison Transmission,\" below.\nThe Utilities\nCECONY\nCECONY, incorporated in New York State in 1884, is a subsidiary of Con Edison and has no significant subsidiaries of its own. Its principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam businesses.\nFor a discussion of the company’s operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional information about the segments, see Note P to the financial statements in Item 8.\nElectric Operations\nElectric Facilities\nCECONY’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $23,770 million and $23,238 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $4,703 million and $4,333 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and for its portion of the steam-electric generation facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $577 million and $580 million, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See \"CECONY – Steam Operations – Steam Facilities,\" below.  \nDistribution Facilities\nCECONY owns 63 area distribution substations and various distribution facilities located throughout New York City and Westchester County. At December 31, 2024, the company’s distribution system had a transformer capacity of 32,496 MVA, with 37,935 miles of overhead distribution lines and 98,898 miles of underground distribution lines. The underground distribution lines represent the single longest underground electric delivery system in the United States.\nTransmission Facilities\nCECONY’s transmission facilities are located in New York City and Westchester, Orange, Rockland, Putnam and Dutchess counties in New York State. At December 31, 2024, the company owned or jointly owned\n 490 miles of overhead circuits operating at 138, 230, 345 and 500 kV and 760 miles of underground circuits operating at 69, 138 and 345 kV. \nThe compa\nny’s 40 transmission substations and 63 area stations are supplied by circuits operated at 69 kV and above. CECONY’\ns transmission facilities interconnect with those of National Grid, Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation, O&R, New York State Electric & Gas, Eversource Energy, Long Island Power Authority, NYPA, New York Transco and Public Service Electric and Gas Company.\n20\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nGenerating Facilities \nCECONY’s electric generating facilities consist of plants located in Manhattan whose primary purpose is to produce steam for the company's steam business and also co-produce electricity. The facilities have a combined electric nameplate capacity of approximately 634 MW. The company expects to have sufficient amounts of gas and fuel oil available in 2025 for use in these facilities.\nElectric Sales and Deliveries\nCECONY delivers electricity to its full-service customers who purchase electricity from the company. Under the company's retail choice program, CECONY also delivers electricity to its customers who choose to purchase electricity from other load serving entities. In addition, the company delivers electricity to state and municipal customers of the NYPA.\nThe company charges all customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity. The company generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. CECONY’s electric delivery revenues are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its electric delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. CECONY’s electric sales and deliveries for the last five years were:\n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n  \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nElectric Energy Delivered \n(millions of kWh)\nCECONY full service customers\n22,272\n22,657\n22,547\n20,710\n20,544\nDelivery service for retail choice customers\n20,715\n20,315\n21,116\n21,549\n22,000\nDelivery service to NYPA customers and others\n9,440\n9,284\n9,357\n9,069\n9,027\nTotal Deliveries in Franchise Area\n52,427\n52,256\n53,020\n51,328\n51,571\nElectric Energy Delivered \n($ in millions)\nCECONY full service customers\n$7,178\n$6,305\n$6,192\n$5,299\n$4,804\nDelivery service for retail choice customers\n2,697\n2,394\n2,526\n2,613\n2,391\nDelivery service to NYPA customers and others\n849\n758\n715\n683\n638\nOther operating revenues\n(7)\n621\n318\n211\n270\nTotal Deliveries in Franchise Area\n$10,717\n$10,078\n$9,751\n$8,806\n$8,103\nAverage Revenue per kWh Sold \n(Cents)\nResidential\n$35.7\n$30.1\n$28.8\n$27.3\n$26.1\nCommercial and industrial\n$28.3\n$25.4\n$26.0\n$23.5\n$20.2\nFor further discussion of the company’s electric operating revenues and its electric results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note P to the financial statements in Item 8.\nElectric Peak Demand\nThe electric peak demand in CECONY’s service area typically occurs during the summer air conditioning season. CECONY’s 2024 service area actual hourly peak demand (June-August) was 11,822 MW, which occurred on July 16, 2024. At “Design Weather Conditions,” electric peak demand in CECONY’s service area would have been approximately 12,540 MW. Design Weather Conditions for the electric system is a standard to which the actual hourly peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. Since NYISO-invoked demand reduction programs can only be called upon under specific circumstances, Design Weather Conditions do not include these programs' potential impact. However, the CECONY forecasted hourly peak demand at Design Weather Conditions does include the impact of certain demand reduction programs. The company estimates that, under Design Weather Conditions, the 2025 service area hourly peak demand will be 12,610 MW. As of January 2025, the company forecasts an average annual increase in hourly electric peak demand in its service area at Design Weather Conditions over the next five years to be approximately 1 percent per year due to the anticipated increase in electric vehicles in CECONY's service territory, among other things, offset by the effect of certain energy efficiency programs. The five-year forecast in peak demand is used by the company for electric supply and capital expenditures planning purposes.\nElectric Supply\nMost of the electricity sold by CECONY to its full-service customers in 2024 was purchased through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. The company expects that resources will again be adequate to meet \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n21\n                      \nthe requirements of its customers in 2025. The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its full-service customers through a combination of electricity purchased under contract, purchased through the NYISO’s wholesale electricity market, or generated from its electricity generating facilities. For information about the company’s contracts for electric generating capacity, see Notes I and Q to the financial statements in Item 8. To reduce the volatility of its full-service customers’ electric energy costs, the company enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its expected purchases through the NYISO’s wholesale electricity market.\nCECONY owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system and local reliability support. The generating stations have a combined electric nameplate capacity of approximately 780 MW. For information about electric generating capacity owned by the company, see “Electric Operations – Electric Facilities – Generating Facilities,” above.\nIn general, the Utilities recover their costs of purchasing power for full-service customers, including the cost of hedging purchase prices, pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See “Financial and Commodity Market Risks – Commodity Price Risk” in Item 7 and “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. \nElectric Reliability Needs\nCECONY monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource adequacy within the framework of the NYISO reliability planning process. \nIn 2019, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation issued regulations (Peaker Rule) that may require the retirement or seasonal unavailability of fossil-fueled electric generating units owned by CECONY and others in New York City. The Peaker Rule limits nitrous oxides emissions during the ozone season from May through September and affects older peaking units that are generally located downstate and needed during periods of high electric demand or for local reliability purposes. Compliance with the Peaker Rule would impact approximately 1,700 MW (nameplate capacity) of generating units in CECONY's service territory (including 70 MW owned by CECONY), of which approximately 989 MW (including 70 MW owned by CECONY) have since been retired or limited operation\n. An additional 709 MW (in nameplate capacity) of peaker plants were expected to become unavailable beginning May 1, 2025. In Ju\nly 2023, the NYISO found an electric reliability need beginning in the summer of 2025 in CECONY’s New York City territory primarily driven by forecasted increases in peak demand and the unavailability of units impacted by the Peaker Rule. In November 2023, after soliciting and evaluating both regulated and market-based solutions, the NYISO determined that there were no viable and sufficient solutions submitted that meet the reliability need in 2025. As a result, the NYISO stated that it may temporarily retain 672 MW of the remaining units impacted by the Peaker Rule until May 2027 to ensure the continued reliability of electric service in New York City.\nIn January 2021, CECONY updated its Local Transmission Plan to address identified reliability needs on its local system resulting from the Peaker Rule through the construction of three transmission projects, the Reliable Clean City (RCC) projects. In April 2021, the NYSPSC approved CECONY’s December 2020 petition to recover $780 million of costs to construct the RCC projects. In May 2023, the first of the three RCC projects was completed and placed in service; the remaining two are expected to be completed in 2025.  \nIn April 2023, the NYSPSC approved CECONY’s December 2022 petition seeking cost recovery approval for a proposed clean energy hub in Brooklyn, New York (Brooklyn Clean Energy Hub). The Brooklyn Clean Energy Hub primarily addresses an identified reliability need in 2028 due to a forecasted increase in electric demand. Construction began in September 2023 and is expected to be completed by 2028.\nIn January 2024, the NYSPSC approved CECONY's August 2023 petition requesting authorization and cost recovery to construct two new substations in Jamaica, Queens (the Idlewild Project) that is in addition to the capital expenditures approved in CECONY's 2023 electric rate plan. The project is expected to be completed by May 2028 to meet anticipated reliability needs and to support New York State’s goals set forth in the CLCPA. \nCECONY estimates that construction will cost $1,200 million. \nCapital expenditures approved in CECONY’s 2023 electric rate plan to address identified reliability needs in New York City include CECONY’s projects to: transfer electric customers from its Brownsville substation to its Glendale substation (estimated completion in 2026); and to build a transmission feeder between Vernon and Newtown (estimated completion in 2026). CECONY’s January 2025 electric rate case filing requested approval to add the costs for the Gateway Park area substation (estimated completion in 2028) into its base rates. \n22\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nIn November 2024, the NYISO issued its 2024 Reliability Needs Assessment (RNA) that identifies a bulk power system electric reliability need in New York City beginning in the summer of 2033 and increasing in the summer of 2034 that is primarily driven by a combination of forecasted increases in peak demand and the assumed retirement of the NYPA small gas plants. In 2025, the NYISO is expected to issue a solicitation for both market-based and regulated solutions. CECONY, as the Responsible Transmission Owner, would propose a regulated backstop solution. Additionally, CECONY identified and developed a solution for a local reliability need reported in the RNA that may begin as soon as the summer of 2026 in the Greenwood 138 kV transmission load area. As with other local reliability needs, this need will be addressed through CECONY’s local transmission and distribution plans, which are included in its January 2025 electric rate case filing.  \nGas Operations\nGas Facilities\nCECONY’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution facilities, were $11,830 million and $11,226 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNatural gas is delivered by interstate pipelines to CECONY at various points in or near its service territory and is distributed to customers by the company through an estimated 4,384 miles of mains and 379,888 service lines. The company owns a natural gas liquefaction facility and storage tank at its Astoria property in Queens, New York. The plant can store 1,062 MDt of which a maximum of about 240 MDt can be withdrawn per day. The company has approximately 1,226 MDt of additional natural gas storage capacity available to it at a field in upstate New York, owned and operated by Honeoye, a corporation 71.2 percent owned by Con Edison Transmission and 28.8 percent owned by CECONY. Con Edison Transmission and CECONY are considering strategic alternatives with respect to their investments in Honeoye.  \nGas Sales and Deliveries\nCECONY delivers gas to its full-service customers who purchase gas from the company. The company generally recovers the cost of the gas that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the gas it sells. Under the company's retail choice program, CECONY also delivers gas to its customers who choose to purchase gas from other suppliers. CECONY’s gas delivery revenues are subject to a weather normalization clause and a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its gas delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. CECONY’s gas sales and deliveries for the last five years were:\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n23\n                      \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nGas Delivered \n(MDt)\nFirm sales\nFull service\n74,503\n77,525\n85,246\n81,637\n78,515\nFirm transportation\n71,521\n72,740\n75,172\n76,765\n76,614\nTotal Firm Sales\n146,024\n150,265\n160,418\n158,402\n155,129\nInterruptible sales\n2,959\n7,892\n6,098\n5,927\n8,482\nTotal Gas Delivered to CECONY Customers\n148,983\n158,157\n166,516\n164,329\n163,611\nTransportation of customer-owned gas\nNYPA\n56,291\n53,541\n45,085\n43,094\n41,577\nOther (mainly generating plants and interruptible transportation)\n79,930\n80,378\n72,448\n67,871\n70,537\nOff-system sales\n12\n12\n12\n12\n12\nTotal Sales\n285,216\n292,088\n284,061\n275,306\n275,737\nGas Delivered\n ($ in millions)\nFirm sales\nFull service\n$1,788\n$1,791\n$1,850\n$1,473\n$1,229\nFirm transportation\n914\n853\n798\n704\n649\nTotal Firm Sales\n2,702\n2,644\n2,648\n2,177\n1,878\nInterruptible sales\n28\n49\n51\n29\n27\nTotal Gas Delivered to CECONY Customers\n2,730\n2,693\n2,699\n2,206\n1,905\nTransportation of customer-owned gas\nNYPA\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nOther (mainly generating plants and interruptible transportation)\n60\n58\n64\n59\n55\nOther operating revenues (mainly regulatory amortizations)\n42\n76\n159\n111\n74\nTotal Sales\n$2,834\n$2,829\n$2,924\n$2,378\n$2,036\nAverage Revenue per Dt Sold\nResidential\n$25.93\n$26.63\n$24.67\n$20.71\n$18.59\nGeneral\n$21.18\n$18.03\n$17.17\n$13.67\n$10.77\nFor further discussion of the company’s gas operating revenues and its gas results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note P to the financial statements in Item 8.\nGas Peak Demand\nThe gas actual peak day demand for firm gas customers in CECONY’s service area occurs during the winter heating season and during the winter of 2024/2025 (through January 31, 2025) occurred on January 21, 2025 when the firm gas customers' demand reached approximately 1,263 MDt. “Design Weather Conditions” for the gas system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company estimates that, under Design Weather Conditions, the 2025/2026 service area peak day demand for firm gas customers will be 1,650 MDt. The forecasted peak day demand for firm gas customers at design conditions does not include gas used by interruptible gas customers including electric and steam generating stations. As of January 2025, the company forecasts an average annual increase of the gas peak day demand for firm gas customers over the next five years at design conditions of approximately 0.1 percent in its service area. The five-year forecast in peak demand is used by the company for gas supply and capital expenditures planning purposes.   \nGas Supply\nCECONY and O&R have combined their gas requirements, and contracts to meet those requirements, into a single portfolio. The combined portfolio is administered by, and related management services are provided by, CECONY (for itself and as agent for O&R) and costs are allocated between the Utilities in accordance with provisions approved by the NYSPSC. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCharges from suppliers for the firm purchase of gas, which are based on formulas or indexes or are subject to negotiation, are generally designed to approximate market prices. The Utilities have contracts with interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of firm transportation from upstream points where gas has been purchased to the Utilities’ distribution systems, and for upstream storage services. Charges under these transportation and storage contracts are approved by the FERC. The Utilities are required to pay certain fixed charges under the supply, transportation and storage contracts whether or not the contracted capacity is actually used. These fixed charges amounted to approximately $422.3 million in 2024, including $371.8 million for CECONY. At December 31, 2024, the contracts were for various terms extending to 2027 for supply and 2046 for transportation and storage. \n24\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nDuring 2024, CECONY entered into no new transportation contracts and O&R entered in one new transportation contract that increased volume. In addition, the Utilities purchase gas on the spot market and contract for interruptible gas transportation. See “Contractual Obligations,” below and “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A, Note Q and Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nSteam Operations\nSteam Facilities\nCECONY’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for steam facilities, including steam's portion of the steam-electric generation facilities, were $2,006 million and $1,990 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See \"CECONY – Electric Operations – Electric Facilities,\" above.  \nCECONY generates steam at one steam-electric generating station and four steam-only generating stations and distributes steam to its customers through approximately 106 miles of transmission, distribution and service piping.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n25\n                      \nSteam Sales and Deliveries\nCECONY’s steam sales and deliveries for the last five years were:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nSteam Sold \n(MMlb)\nGeneral\n428\n428\n513\n504\n445\nApartment house\n4,880\n4,657\n5,122\n5,013\n5,131\nAnnual power\n10,186\n10,359\n11,792\n11,367\n10,977\nTotal Steam Delivered to CECONY Customers\n15,494\n15,444\n17,427\n16,884\n16,553\nSteam Sold \n($ in millions)\nGeneral\n$31\n$25\n$27\n$25\n23\nApartment house\n162\n150\n155\n137\n136\nAnnual power\n395\n363\n391\n340\n321\nOther operating revenues\n(10)\n31\n20\n30\n28\nTotal Steam Delivered to CECONY Customers\n$578\n$569\n$593\n$532\n$508\nAverage Revenue per Mlb Sold\n$37.95\n$34.84\n$32.88\n$29.73\n$29.00\nFor further discussion of the company’s steam operating revenues and its steam results, see “Results of Operations” in Item 7. For additional segment information, see Note P to the financial statements in Item 8.\nSteam Peak Demand and Capacity\nThe steam actual hourly peak demand in CECONY’s service area occurs during the winter heating season and during the winter of 2024/2025 (through January 31, 2025) occurred on January 22, 2025 when the actual hourly demand reached approximately 7.1 MMlb per hour. “Design Weather Conditions” for the steam system is a standard to which the actual hourly peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company’s estimate for the winter of 2025/2026 hourly peak demand of its steam customers is about 7.6 MMlb per hour under Design Weather Conditions. As of January 2025, the company forecasts an average annual decrease in steam hourly peak demand in its service area at Design Weather Conditions over the next five years to be approximately 0.4 percent. The five-year forecast in peak demand is used by the company for steam supply and capital expenditures planning purposes.\nOn December 31, 2024, the steam system was capable of delivering approximately 11.5 MMlb of steam per hour, and CECONY estimates that the system will maintain the same capability throughout the 2025/2026 winter.\nSteam Supply\n33 percent of the steam produced by CECONY in 2024 was supplied by the company’s steam-only generating assets; 46 percent was produced by the company’s steam-electric generating assets, where steam and electricity are primarily cogenerated; and 21 percent was purchased under an agreement with Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners L.P.\nO&R\nElectric Operations\nElectric Facilities\nO&R’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $1,359 million and $1,253 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $369 million and $319 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nO&R and RECO own, in whole or in part, transmission and distribution facilities which include 549 circuit miles of transmission lines, 15 transmission substations, 64 distribution substations, 90,755 in-service line transformers, 3,877 pole miles of overhead distribution lines and 2,405 miles of underground distribution lines. O&R’s transmission system is part of the NYISO system except that portions of RECO’s system are located within the transmission area controlled by PJM.\nElectric Sales and Deliveries\nO&R delivers electricity to its full-service customers who purchase electricity from the company. Under the company's retail choice program, O&R also delivers electricity to its customers who purchase electricity from load serving entities.\n26\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nThe company charges all customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity. O&R generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. O&R’s New York electric revenues\n (which accounted for 74.63 percent of O&R’s electric revenues in 2024) are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanis\nm. As a result, O&R’s New York electric delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved\n. Effective July 202\n1, the majority of O&R’s electric distribution revenues in New Jersey are subject to a conservation incentive program, as a result of which distribution revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&R’s electric transmission revenues in New Jersey are not subject to a conservation incentive program, and as a result, changes in such volumes do impact revenues.

For additional segment information, see Note P to the financial statements in Item 8.\nElectric Peak Demand\nThe electric peak demand in O&R’s service area typically occurs during the summer air conditioning season. O&R’s 2024 service area actual hourly peak demand (June-August) was 1,484 MW, which occurred on July 16, 2024. At “Design Weather Conditions,” electric peak demand in O&R’s service area would have been approximately 1,533 MW. Design Weather Conditions for the electric system is a standard to which the actual hourly peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. Since NYISO-invoked demand reduction programs can only be called upon under specific circumstances, Design Weather Conditions do not include these programs' potential impact. However, the O&R forecasted hourly peak demand at design conditions does include the impact of certain demand reduction programs. The company estimates that, under Design Weather Conditions, the 2025 service area peak demand will be 1,600 MW. As of January 2025, the company forecasts an average annual increase in hourly electric peak demand in its service area at design conditions over the next five years to be approximately 3.6 percent due to electric vehicles and anticipated load growth from data centers, among other things, offset by the effect of certain electric energy efficiency programs. The five-year forecast in peak demand is used by the company for electric supply and capital expenditures planning purposes.\nElectric Supply\nThe electricity O&R sold to its full-service customers in 2024 was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity market. The company expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2025. O&R does not own any electric generating capacity. The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers through a combination of electricity purchased under contracts or purchased through the wholesale electricity market. To reduce the volatility of its customers’ electric energy costs, the company has contracts to purchase electric energy and enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its expected purchases. For information about the company’s contracts, see Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8.\nIn general, the Utilities recover their costs of purchasing power for full service customers, including the cost of hedging purchase prices, pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See “Financial and Commodity Market Risks – Commodity Price Risk,” in Item 7 and “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned the NYSPSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n27\n                      \nGas Operations\nGas Facilities\nO&R’s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution facilities, were $873 million and $797 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Natural gas is delivered by pipeline to O&R at various points in or near its service territory and is distributed to customers by the company through an estimated 1,900 miles of mains and 107,745 service lines.\nGas Sales and Deliveries\nO&R delivers gas to its full-service customers who purchase gas from the company.

See Notes J, W and X to the financial statements in Item 8.\n(e)\nIncluded in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of natural gas supply, transportation and storage that the Utilities are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.\n(f)\nIncluded in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of energy that the Utilities are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices.\n32\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n(g)\nAmounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day-to-day operations, were derived from the Utilities’ purchasing system as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount authorized. Payments for the “Other Purchase Obligations” are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. Long-term Purchase Obligations, which co\nmprises $3,126 million of \"Other\n Purchase Obligations,\" were derived from the Utilities' purchasing system by using a method that identifies the remaining purchase obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved to enable them to report their “Other Purchase Obligations” in a different manner.\nThe Companies’ commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include their other liabilities reflected on their balance sheets, any funding obligations for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans, financial hedging activities, their collective bargaining agreements and Con Edison’s guarantee of certain obligations. See Notes E, F, Q and “Guarantees” in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCapital Resources\nCon Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison finances its capital requirements primarily through internally-generated funds, the sale of its common shares or external borrowings. Con Edison’s ability to make payments on external borrowings and dividends on its common shares depends on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries, proceeds from the sale of additional common shares or its interests in its subsidiaries or additional external borrowings. See \"Con Edison's Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries\" in Item 1A and Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.\nFor information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements in Item 8.\nFor information on the Companies’ commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements in Item 8.\nThe Companies require access to the capital markets to fund capital requirements that are substantially in excess of available internally-generated funds. See “Capital Requirements,” above and \"The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets to Satisfy Funding Requirements” in Item 1A and each of the Companies believes that it will continue to be able to access capital, although financial market conditions or changes in the Companies' credit ratings may affect the timing and cost of the Companies’ financing activities. The Companies monitor the availability and costs of various forms of capital, and will seek to issue Con Edison common shares and other securities when it is necessary or advantageous to do so. For information about the Companies’ long-term debt and short-term borrowing, see Notes C and D to the financial statements in Item 8.\nThe Utilities finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally-generated funds, contributions of equity capital from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 7.\nCon Edison plans to meet its capital requirements for 2025 through 2029 through internally-generated funds and the issuance of long-term debt and common equity. See “Capital Requirements and Resources - Capital Requirements\" in Item 1. Con Edison's plans include the issuance of up to $1,750 million of long-term debt in 2025 and up to $3,800 million of long-term debt in 2026, including for maturing securities, at the Utilities and approximately $9,100 million in aggregate of long-term debt, including for maturing securities, at the Utilities during 2027 through 2029.  Con Edison plans to issue up to $1,350 million of common equity in 2025 which includes the physical settlement of the estimated $677 million available under its December 2024 equity forward transaction, in addition to equity issued under its dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and long-term incentive plans. Con Edison also plans to issue common equity of approximately $1,850 million in 2026 and up to $4,300 million in aggregate during 2027 through 2029, in addition to equity issued under its dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and long-term incentive plans. Con Edison’s estimates of its capital requirements and related financing plans reflect information available and assumptions at the time the statements are made and include, among other things, the assumptions that the Utilities’ forecasted capital expenditures and financing plans through 2029 are approved by the NYSPSC. Con Edison’s financing plans do not include the impact, if any, that may result from its evaluation of strategic alternatives with respect to MVP and Honeoye. See \"Con Edison Transmission\" in Item 1. Actual developments and the timing and amount of funding may differ materially. \nIn 2024, the NYSPSC authorized CECONY, through 2027, to issue up to $6,050 million of debt securities ($2,625 million of which the company had issued as of December 31, 2024). In 2022, the NYSPSC authorized O&R, through 2025, to issue up to $285 million of debt securities ($275 million of which the company had issued as of December 31, 2024). The NYSPSC also authorized CECONY and O&R for such periods to issue debt securities to refund existing debt securities of up to $2,500 million and $125 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, CECONY redeemed $225 million of its Series 2010A tax-exempt bonds and O&R had not refunded any securities \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n33\n                      \npursuant to these authorizations. In January 2025, O&R filed a petition with the NYSPSC requesting authority, through 2028, to issue up to $700 million of debt securities and to refund existing debt securities of up to $125 million.\nFERC has authorized CECONY through April 30, 2026 and O&R through July 31, 2026 to issue short-term borrowings for a period of not more than 12 months, in an amount not to exceed $4,000 million and $250 million, respectively, at prevailing market rates.\nCon Edison Transmission has financed its operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions and borrowings from Con Edison and internally-generated funds. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 7.\nFor each of the Companies, the common equity ratio for the last five years was:\nCommon Equity Ratio\n(Percent of total capitalization)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nCon Edison\n47.1 \n49.1 \n50.9 \n47.4 \n48.3 \nCECONY\n46.0 \n47.9 \n46.9 \n47.0 \n47.9 \nThe credit ratings assigned by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch to the issuer rating and commercial paper rating of Con Edison, and the senior unsecured debt and commercial paper ratings of CECONY and O&R are as follows:\nMoody's\nS&P\nFitch\nCon Edison\nIssuer Rating\nBaa1\nA-\nBBB+\nCommercial Paper\nP-2\nA-2\nF2\nCECONY\nSenior Unsecured Debt\nA3\nA-\nA-\nCommercial Paper\nP-2\nA-2\nF2\nO&R\nSenior Unsecured Debt\nBaa2\nA-\nA-\nCommercial Paper\nP-2\nA-2\nF2\nCredit ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities.

See “The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements” and “Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies” in Item 1A.\nEnvironmental Matters\nClean Energy Future\nNew York State’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act\nIn 2019, New York State enacted the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) that established a goal of 70 percent of the electricity procured by load serving entities regulated by the NYSPSC to be produced by renewable energy systems by 2030 and requires the statewide electrical demand system to have zero emissions by 2040. The law also codified state targets for energy efficiency (end-use energy savings of 185 trillion British thermal units below 2025 energy-use forecast), offshore wind (9,000 MW by 2035), solar (6,000 MW by 2025) and energy storage (3,000 MW by 2030, that was subsequently increased by the NYSPSC to 6,000 MW by 2030). See “Energy Storage,” below. The CLCPA established a climate action council that made recommendations for meeting the statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction requirements through displacing fossil-fuel fired electricity with renewable electricity, transitioning heating and transportation to lower GHG impact fuels (including substantial electrification), implementing energy efficiency measures and providing 35 percent to 40 percent of the benefits of CLCPA-related investments to disadvantaged communities. As required by the law, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) adopted regulations establishing statewide GHG emissions limits that are 60 percent of 1990 emissions levels by 2030 and 15 percent of 1990 emissions by 2050. The Utilities are unable to predict the impact on them of the implementation of this law.\nCECONY and O&R have been required to obtain renewable energy credits (RECs) and zero-emissions credits (ZECs) for their full-service customers since 2017. In October 2020, the NYSPSC, in response to the CLCPA, established a new RECs program to support increased renewable energy availability in New York City for which the costs would be borne by load serving entities across New York State on a volumetric basis. Load serving entities \n34\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nmay satisfy their REC obligation by either purchasing RECs acquired through central procurement by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), by self-supply through direct purchase of tradable RECs, or by making alternative compliance payments. Load serving entities purchase ZECs from NYSERDA at prices determined by the NYSPSC. In April 2022, the NYSPSC issued an order approving contracts between NYSERDA and two project sponsors selected by NYSERDA to provide RECs that support transmission lines bringing renewable energy directly to New York City (Clean Path New York and H.Q. Energy Services (U.S.) Inc.) that anticipate in-service dates of 2027 and 2026, respectively. Both projects have submitted requests to the NYISO to interconnect to CECONY’s high-voltage transmission system. In December 2024, NYSERDA and Clean Path NY terminated their REC contract by mutual consent. Also in December 2024, New York Power Authority (NYPA), the project’s sponsor who had proposed to develop the project in partnership with a joint venture filed a petition with the NYSPSC to develop the project as a NYPA priority transmission project.  \nIn May 2024, CECONY filed its inaugural annual Investing in Disadvantaged Communities (DACs) Report, as required by the NYSPSC. The report summarizes the impacts of CECONY's investments in DACs within the company’s service territory, based on 2023 data. The report includes, among other things, building electrification and energy efficiency initiatives, as well as data related to the company’s long-running electric and gas operations. DAC locations were identified by New York State in connection with the implementation process for the CLCPA.\nIn September 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order evaluating the combined gas system long-term plan (the GSLTP) filed by the Utilities in November 2023. The order directs the Utilities to make additional filings to further the process of decarbonizing their gas systems and achieving the GHG emission reduction targets established in the CLCPA. These additional filings include, among other things, a proposal for a demand response program; a non-pipes alternatives deployment plan; a report on pipeline safety, including records to substantiate maximum allowable operating pressure in certain pipe segments; a definition of hard-to-electrify customers; reports on the benefits to, and impacts on, DACs; and a bill impact analysis that reflects reduced natural gas usage over a 20-year period for every service classification. The order also directs the Utilities to include certain information in their annual updates to the GSLTP and in their next GSLTP, due 2027, such as increases in electric load and associated reliability impacts and a description of a scenario that meets all load growth with non-pipe alternatives rather than additional infrastructure, and for the Utilities to identify a preferred pathway among the three pathways set forth in the GSLTP.\nIn November 2024, the FERC approved an August 2024 settlement agreement regarding CECONY’s return on equity for transmission projects. The settlement agreement provides for a formula rate to the NYISO tariff to enable CECONY to recover the costs and a return on equity of: (1) 10.6 percent for transmission projects that CECONY exercises its right of first refusal; (2) 10.85 percent for all other transmission projects selected by the NYISO to meet a public policy transmission need; and (3) the lower of the NYSPSC-determined rates or 10.6 percent for transmission projects needed to meet local New York State climate and renewable energy goals. Parties to the settlement agreement are restricted from seeking to challenge the return on equity levels for five years.   \nAlso in November 2024, CECONY, pursuant to the NYSPSC’s August 2024 order instituting a proceeding that directed New York utilities, including CECONY and O&R, to proactively identify grid upgrades needed to meet new demand from transportation and building heating electrification across New York State (the Proactive Planning Proceeding), requested that the NYSPSC approve nine urgent projects totaling $856 million. CECONY requested that the NYSPSC authorize the urgent projects no later than March 2025.\n \nO&R did not make an urgent project filing because its November 2024 Joint Proposal included projects that would have otherwise been considered urgent. See “Rate Plans – O&R New York Electric” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.\nIn November and December 2024, New York utilities, including CECONY and O&R, pursuant to the Proactive Planning Proceeding for building and vehicle electrification: (1) filed a proposed framework for the NYSPSC to use in evaluating proposed urgent projects, cost allocation and cost recovery, (2) proposed (for CECONY) nine urgent projects for approval by the NYSPSC and (3) proposed a long-term coordinated planning process framework to study and identify necessary upgrades to support electrification.\n \nAlso in December 2024, the FERC approved a September 2024 settlement agreement regarding O&R’s return on equity for transmission projects. The settlement agreement provides for a formula rate to the NYISO tariff to enable O&R to recover the costs and a return on equity of: (1) 10.5 percent for transmission projects that O&R exercises its right of first refusal; (2) 10.85 percent for all other transmission projects selected by the NYISO to meet a public policy transmission need; and (3) the lower of the NYSPSC-determined rates or 10.6 percent for transmission projects needed to meet local New York State climate and renewable energy goals. Parties to the settlement agreement are restricted from seeking to challenge the return on equity levels for five years.\nIn January 2025, CECONY published its integrated long-range plan (ILRP) for the clean energy transition. The ILRP sets forth CECONY’s planning and investment strategy to provide safe, reliable and resilient service to customers and to support the decarbonization of energy use for electric, gas and steam customers, aligning with the \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n35\n                      \ngreenhouse gas emissions reduction targets mandated by the CLCPA. Meeting the goals of the CLCPA will require capital expenditures above historic norms. While the details of CECONY’s investments will continue to be addressed in its rate cases or other filings, subject to the approval of the NYSPSC, CECONY projects that $72 billion of capital expenditures will be needed between 2025 and 2034 to implement its strategy.\nOffshore Wind\nIn an effort to meet the CLCPA’s offshore wind goals, load serving entities, such as CECONY and O&R, will be required to purchase offshore wind renewable energy credits beginning in 2026 when NYSERDA's offshore wind projects are expected to begin operation.\nNYSERDA has issued competitive solicitations for offshore wind energy resulting in two projects that are in development, Sunrise Wind (924 MW), a project that began construction in June 2024 and is expected to enter commercial operation in 2026 and Empire Wind 1 (810 MW), a project that is expected to enter commercial operation in 2027 and connect to the New York City electrical grid at CECONY’s Gowanus substation. In March 2024, FERC approved the interconnection agreement among Empire Offshore Wind LLC, the NYISO and CECONY. In May 2024, the NYSPSC approved a certificate of public convenience and necessity to allow construction of Empire Wind 1 to begin. In February 2025, the NYSPSC granted final approval of Empire Offshore Wind LLC's petition to construct and operate the New York offshore and onshore transmission facilities for Empire Wind 1. At December 31, 2024, New York has one operating offshore wind farm that was awarded a contract by LIPA, the South Fork Wind Farm (132 MW). See “Federal Regulation,” above. \nBuilding Electrification and Energy Efficiency\nIn January 2020, and updated in August 2022, the NYSPSC issued an order directing energy efficiency targets and budgets for New York utilities. The order approved electric and gas energy efficiency programs and heat pump budgets for building electrification, and associated targets, for the years 2020 through 2025 to meet the NYSPSC’s goal of reducing electric use by 3 percent annually and gas use by 1.3 percent annually by 2025. The order and subsequent update authorized budgets for the years 2020 through 2025 for: electric energy efficiency programs of $688 million and $71 million for CECONY and O&R, respectively; gas energy efficiency programs of $338 million and $17 million for CECONY and O&R, respectively; and heat pump programs of $1,106 million and $15 million for CECONY and O&R, respectively. CECONY’s current electric and gas rate plans allow it to recover the costs of heat pumps for building electrification and energy efficiency expenditures, including a full rate of return, in rates from customers. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.\nIn November 2023, and updated in January 2024, CECONY and O&R filed preliminary proposals for energy efficiency and heat pump programs for 2026-2030 with aggregate budgets of approximately $2,744 million and $129 million, respectively. The aggregate amounts are comprised of average annual budgets of up to: $373 million and $22 million for electric energy efficiency and heat pump programs for CECONY and O&R, respectively, $150 million and $4 million for gas energy efficiency programs for CECONY and O&R, respectively, and $26 million for steam energy efficiency programs for CECONY. These amounts are subject to approval by the NYSPSC.\nElectric Vehicles\nIn July 2020, the NYSPSC established light-duty electric vehicle make-ready and other infrastructure programs that included budgets of $290 million and $24 million for CECONY and O&R, respectively, through 2025. In November 2023, the light-duty infrastructure and other programs, including medium and heavy-duty make-ready pilot projects and a new micromobility infrastructure incentive program, were expanded to approximately $823 million for CECONY and $56 million for O&R, with the ability to extend beyond 2025. The NYSPSC authorized CECONY and O&R to recover these costs, including a full rate of return, through surcharge mechanisms and subsequently in rates from customers. \nIn July 2022, the NYSPSC issued an order that provides CECONY and O&R with up to a total of $31 million and $5.8 million, respectively, through 2025, for implementation of residential vehicle managed charging programs and administration costs. The NYSPSC authorized CECONY and O&R to recover these costs through surcharge mechanisms. The order also provides CECONY and O&R with authorization to offer incentives to encourage electric vehicle charging to occur overnight and during off-peak times totaling approximately $71.8 million and $8.2 million, respectively, through 2025, that would be recovered through the respective company’s revenue reconciliation mechanisms. \nIn October 2022, the NJBPU approved RECO’s electric vehicle make-ready program that includes a budget of $7.6 million through 2026 for electric vehicle infrastructure and related program costs. The NJBPU authorized RECO to recover these costs, including a full rate of return, in rates from customers.\n36\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nIn November 2023, the NYSPSC issued an order that provides CECONY and O&R with up to $432 million and $18 million through 2026, respectively, for the implementation of commercial managed charging programs and demand charge rebates, participant incentives and administration costs. The NYSPSC authorized CECONY and O&R to recover these costs, including a full rate of return, through surcharge mechanisms and subsequently in rates from customers. \nEnergy Storage \nIn June 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order adopting an updated roadmap for achieving 6,000 MW of statewide energy storage resource deployment by 2030 and recognized the need for additional statewide energy storage of 12,000 MW by 2040 and 17,000 MW by 2050. The NYSPSC directed New York utilities, including CECONY and O&R, to study the potential of energy storage to provide non-market transmission and distribution services and identify services for which energy storage is suitable.\nCECONY owns and operates two energy storage projects located in Ozone Park, Queens and Fox Hills, Staten Island that are designed to store 1.5 MW/12 MWh and 7.5 MW/30 MWh of energy, respectively. A third energy storage project is under construction in Brownsville, Brooklyn that is designed to store 5.8 MW of energy and that is expected to be completed in 2025. CECONY has procured 115 MW of utility dispatch rights from energy storage projects, is negotiating contracts for additional storage projects and has released a request for proposal for additional utility dispatch rights. The long-term contracts provide CECONY with the right to dispatch energy from the storage projects for both wholesale market and grid purposes. O&R owns and operates an energy storage project located in Pomona, New York that is designed to store 3 MW of energy. O&R is evaluating bids from storage developers for utility dispatch rights. The Utilities expect to recover the cost of energy storage services, including a full rate of return, in rates and surcharges from customers. \nThermal Energy Networks\nIn April 2024, the NYSDPS approved CECONY’s and O&R’s December 2023 Stage 1 filings (Project Scope, Feasibility, and Stakeholder Engagement) for utility-scale thermal energy network pilot projects. The NYSDPS also confirmed CECONY and O&R are authorized to incur costs of $17.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively, through the completion of Stage 2 (Pilot Project Engineering Design and Customer Protection Plan).  These projected costs are within the budgets previously proposed by CECONY and O&R in December 2023 of $255 million and $46 million, respectively. In December 2024, the NYSPSC issued an order approving CECONY’s May 2024 petition seeking $6 million for certain unaddressed costs that are necessary to complete Stage 2 of its utility thermal energy network pilot projects, in addition to the $17.1 million described above. The remaining proposed budget amounts are subject to approval by the NYSPSC.      \nDistribution System and Distributed Resources\nThe NYSPSC is directing development by New York electric utilities of a distributed system platform to manage and coordinate distributed energy resources in their service areas under NYSPSC regulation and to provide customers, together with third parties, with data and tools to better manage their energy use. The NYSPSC has required the Utilities to file distributed system implementation plans and ordered the Utilities to develop demonstration projects to inform distributed system platform business models. As of December 31, 2024, CECONY and O&R had three and one active demonstration projects, respectively.\nThe NYSPSC approved CECONY’s and O&R’s advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) installation plans for their electric and gas delivery businesses, at a cost of $1,285 million and $98.5 million, respectively, and such work was completed in 2024 and 2020, respectively.    \nThe NYSPSC began to change compensation for DERs and place limits on net energy metering (NEM) in 2015. In New York, NEM compensates kilowatt-hours exported to the electric distribution system at the full-service rate for production, delivery, taxes and fees. NYSPSC’s policy is to phase in changes to limit annual bill increases on non-participating customers to two percent. In addition, NEM projects interconnected on or after January 1, 2022 are charged for their share of energy efficiency and other public policy benefit programs.\nNew York City’s Clean Energy Goals\nIn 2014, New York City announced a goal to reduce GHG emissions 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. In May 2019, New York City enacted a package of legislation known as the Climate Mobilization Act, that includes provisions intended to reduce GHG emissions from large buildings by 40 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Building owners may achieve compliance through operational changes, building retrofits, the purchase of GHG offsets, the purchase of renewable energy credits and the use of clean distributed energy resources. CECONY is unable to predict the impact on it of the implementation of this law.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n37\n                      \nFederal Regulation of GHG Emissions\nSection 111 of the Clean Air Act authorizes the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set standards of performance (emissions limits) for new sources of air pollution, including GHG emissions, and establish guidelines for states to issue standards of performance for existing sources.  These standards of performance are based on technology that the EPA determines to be the best system of emission reduction (BSER).\nIn April 2024, the EPA issued a final Section 111 rule (Section 111 Rule) regulating GHG emissions from new electric-generating gas-fired combustion turbines and existing coal, oil, and gas-fired boilers used to generate electricity. The Section 111 Rule did not cover existing electric-generating gas-fired combustion turbines, which the EPA deferred to a potential future rulemaking. The Section 111 Rule included carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) at a 90% capture rate as the BSER for certain new gas-fired combustion turbines and certain existing coal-fired boilers beginning in 2032. A future rule covering existing gas-fired combustion turbines could include this CCS BSER and impact CECONY’s existing gas-fired combustion turbines. After the EPA issued the Section 111 Rule, petitioners challenged it in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) on a number of grounds. Con Edison, as part of a coalition of public and private utilities, intervened in this litigation, arguing that the EPA had the authority to set the BSER, but the coalition took no position as to whether CCS was achievable in the timeframe set forth in the Section 111 Rule. In December 2024, the D.C. Circuit heard oral argument in the case. Given the pending litigation over the Section 111 Rule, the Companies are unable to predict the rule’s impact, if any, on them.\n See \"Federal Regulation,\" above.\nClimate Change\nAs indicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, GHG emissions from manmade sources are changing the world’s climate.\nClimate change could affect customer demand for the Companies’ energy services. It might also cause physical damage to the Companies’ facilities and disruption of their operations due to more frequent and more extreme weather. See “The Failure of, or Damage to, the Companies’ Facilities Could Adversely Affect the Companies” in Item 1A. Past major weather events such as Superstorm Sandy in 2012 and Tropical Storm Isaias in 2020 caused large power outages in the Utilities’ territories and resulted in the Utilities incurring substantial response and restoration costs.    \nIn September 2023, CECONY updated the climate change vulnerability study it issued in 2019 and O&R published its first climate change vulnerability study.\n The studies were developed pursuant to a New York State Public Service law that requires all New York electric utilities to release a climate change vulnerability study and file with the NYSPSC a subsequent climate change resilience plan at least every five years. The law authorizes utilities to recover costs incurred outside of the rate plans through a surcharge and to subsequently include approved costs into base rates during the next rate case proceeding. The Utilities’ studies identified rising temperatures, inland flooding, sea level rise, storm surge, high winds, ice accumulation and extreme and compound weather events to be the biggest risks to their systems. The resulting extreme weather events brought about by climate change are manifested in increased system load, asset degradation, equipment damage and worker safety and accessibility concerns. \nIn February 2025, CECONY and O&R filed updated climate change resilience plans with the NYSPSC in compliance with an order that directed CECONY and O&R to re-submit their November 2023 plans to exclude proposed projects that the NYSPSC determined are not climate resilience investments. CECONY’s and O&R’s updated climate change resilience plans propose investments of $645.4 million and $184.1 million, respectively, between 2025 and 2029 to enhance the resilience of their electric systems against extreme weather events brought about by climate change. The total cost of CECONY’s and O&R’s climate resilience investments from 2025 through 2044 are currently projected to be $5,294 million and $900.4 million, respectively. These investments are subject to approval by the NYSPSC through the base rate case process. CECONY’s January 2025 electric rate case filing requested approval for climate resilience investments of $448.5 million from 2026 through 2028 and O&R’s November 2024 joint proposal for electric rates included climate resilience investments of $110.4 million from 2025 through 2027. See “Rate Plans” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.\nGHG Emissions Reporting\nBased on the most recent data (2022) published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Con Edison estimates that its direct GHG emissions constitute less than 0.1 percent of the nation’s GHG emissions. Con Edison’s estimated Scope 1 emissions of GHG during the past five years were:\n38\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n(Metric tons, \nin millions\n (a))\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nCO2 equivalent emissions\n2.7 \n2.7 \n2.9 \n2.8 \n2.7 \n(a)\nEstimated emissions for 2024 are based on preliminary data and are subject to third-party verification. Scope 1 emissions are GHG emitted into the atmosphere by assets owned by Con Edison. Con Edison’s Scope 1 emissions primarily include emissions from CECONY’s operation of steam, electric, and co-generation plants. Con Edison’s Scope 1 emissions also include fugitive emissions that occur when pressurized equipment and infrastructure containing a GHG has a controlled or uncontrolled emission and emissions from Con Edison’s vehicle fleet.\nCon Edison’s m\nore than 55 percent decre\nase in direct GHG emissions (carbon dioxide, methane and sulfur hexafluoride) from the 2005 baseline (6.0 million metric tons) reflects emission reductions resulting from equipment and repair projects, reduced steam demand, the increased use of natural gas in lieu of fuel oil at CECONY’s steam production facilities and projects to reduce sulfur hexafluoride emissions and to replace leak-prone gas distribution pipes. As a result of the Utilities’ participation in the NYISO wholesale markets, a portion of the Utilities’ NYISO energy purchases are sourced from renewable electric production facilities. The electricity produced by renewable generation offsets the energy that the Utilities would otherwise have procured, thereby reducing the amount of electricity produced by non-renewable production facilities. The Utilities also actively promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable generation to help their customers reduce their GHG emissions.  \nCECONY has participated for several years in voluntary initiatives with the EPA to reduce its methane and sulfur hexafluoride emissions. The Utilities reduce methane emissions from the operation of their gas distribution systems through pipe maintenance and replacement programs and by utilizing technologies to reduce fugitive emissions from leaks or when work is performed on operating assets. The Utilities reduce emissions of sulfur hexafluoride by using improved technologies to locate and repair leaks and by replacing older equipment. In December 2024, NYSDEC adopted a regulation that will impose an emissions limit on owners of gas insulated equipment containing sulfur hexafluoride starting in 2030, including equipment used in electric power transmission and distribution. \nIn January 2016, the NYSPSC approved a 10-year clean energy fund to be managed by NYSERDA under the NYSPSC's supervision. The Utilities collect clean energy fund surcharges from their customers through the system benefit charge. The Utilities billed customers clean energy fund surcha\nrges of $277 million, $\n224 million and $216 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nCECONY is subject to carbon dioxide emissions regulations established by New York State under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) due to its ownership of electric generation assets. The initiative established a decreasing cap on carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the generation of electricity. Under RGGI, affected electric generators are required to obtain emission allowances to cover their carbon dioxide emissions. CECONY will purchase RGGI allowances for the sixth control period (2024 – 2026) based on anticipated emissions, which are expected to be similar to past compliance periods.\nThe cost to the Companies to comply with legislation, regulations or initiatives limiting GHG emissions could be substantial.\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nCon Edison’s sustainability strategy, as it relates to the environment, provides that the company seeks, among other things, to reduce direct and indirect GHG emissions; enhance the efficiency of its water use; reduce its impact to natural ecosystems; focus on reducing, reusing and recycling to lower materials consumption and disposal; and design its work in consideration of climate projections\n. \nCon Edison has adopted a Clean Energy Commitment whereby it commits to the transition to the clean energy future. Con Edison's Clean Energy Commitment is supported by five pillars: \n•\nBuild the grid of the future\n•\nEmpower Con Edison's customers to meet their climate goals\n•\nReimagine the gas system\n•\nLead by reducing Con Edison's carbon footprint\n•\nPartner with stakeholders\nCECONY\nSuperfund\nThe Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation costs, remediation costs (which include costs of demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment and monitoring) and natural resource damages. Liability under these laws can be material and may be imposed for contamination from past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n39\n                      \nat the time they occurred. The sites as to which CECONY has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its and its predecessor companies’ former manufactured gas sites, its multi-purpose Astoria site, the Gowanus Canal site, the Newtown Creek site and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that the company has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against the company under Superfund, estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery from customers of site investigation and remediation costs, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8.\nManufactured Gas Sites\nCECONY and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at 51 sites (MGP Sites) in New York City and Westchester County. Many of these sites have been subdivided and are now owned by parties other than CECONY and have been redeveloped for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The NYSDEC is requiring CECONY to investigate, and if necessary, develop and implement remediation programs for the sites, including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated.\nCECONY has started remedial investigations at all 51 MGP Sites. After investigations, no MGP impacts have been detected at all or portions of 15 sites, and the NYSDEC has issued No Further Action (NFA) letters for these sites.\nCoal tar or other MGP-related contaminants have been detected at the remaining 36 sites. Remedial actions have been completed at all or portions of 14 sites and the NYSDEC has issued NFA letters for these sites. In addition, remedial actions have been completed by property owners at all or portions of four sites under the New York State Brownfield Cleanup Program and Certificates of Completion have been issued by the NYSDEC for these sites. Remedial design, planning or action is ongoing for the remaining sites or portions of sites; however, the information as to the extent of contamination and scope of the remediation likely to be required for many of these sites is incomplete. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on MGP sites (other than the Astoria site, which is discussed below) could range from $622 million to $2,432 million.\nAstoria Site\nCECONY is permitted by the NYSDEC to operate a hazardous waste storage facility on property owned by it in the Astoria section of Queens, New York. Portions of the property were formerly the location of a manufactured gas plant and also have been used or are being used for, among other things, electric generation operations, electric substation operations, the storage of fuel oil, the manufacture and storage of liquefied natural gas and the maintenance and storage of electric equipment. As a condition of its NYSDEC permit, the company is required to investigate the property and, where environmental contamination is found and action is necessary, to remediate the contamination. The company’s investigations are ongoing. The company has submitted reports to the NYSDEC and the New York State Department of Health and in the future will be submitting additional reports identifying the known areas of contamination. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on the property could range from $278 million to $929 million.\nGowanus Canal\nIn August 2009, CECONY received a notice of potential liability and request for information from the EPA about the operations of the company and its predecessors at sites adjacent to or near the 1.8 mile Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, New York. In March 2010, the EPA added the Gowanus Canal to its National Priorities List of Superfund sites. The canal’s adjacent waterfront is primarily commercial and industrial, currently consisting of concrete plants, warehouses and parking lots. The canal is near several residential neighborhoods. In September 2013, the EPA issued its record of decision for the site. The EPA concluded that there was significant contamination at the site, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, metals and volatile organic compounds. The EPA selected a remedy for the site that includes dredging and disposal of some contaminated sediments and stabilization and capping of contamination that will not be removed, and in 2013 the EPA estimated the cost of the selected remedy to be $506 million (and has indicated the actual cost could be significantly higher). The EPA has identified 39 potentially responsible parties (PRPs) with respect to the site, including CECONY (which the EPA indicated has facilities that may be a source of PCBs at the site). The EPA ordered the PRPs, including CECONY, to coordinate and cooperate with each other to perform and/or fund the remedial design for the selected remedy, which current estimates indicate could cost approximately $115 million. CECONY is funding its allocated share of the remedial design costs along with the other PRPs. In April 2019, the EPA issued an order that requires the PRPs, including CECONY, to: (1) design and perform bulkhead structural support work, including associated access dredging, along certain portions of the upper reaches of the canal, and (2) complete the design work for bulkhead structural support along certain portions of the middle part of the canal. The PRPs and CECONY are coordinating the implementation of this order.\n40\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nIn January 2020, the EPA issued an order that requires six PRPs, including CECONY, to initiate the remedial action work in the upper reaches of the canal following the completion of the bulkhead upgrades. Cleanup in other areas of the canal is not addressed by this order. In November 2020, the PRPs began implementation of the work required under this order. In August 2024, dredging and stabilization was completed in the upper segment of the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site at a cost of approximately $260 million.  \nIn March 2024, CECONY received a notice that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the NYSDEC, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (collectively, the Trustees) published a Draft Natural Resource Assessment Plan, indicating that the Trustees are conducting a natural resource damage assessment to determine, among other things, the appropriate amount and type of projects needed to restore, replace, or acquire the equivalent of injured natural resources at the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site.\nIn June 2024, the EPA issued an order amending its January 2020 order and that requires six PRPs, including CECONY, to initiate remedial action work in the middle segment of the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site. The EPA estimated the cost of this work would be $369 million (although actual costs may be significantly higher) and has indicated the work would take several years to complete. \nIn October 2024, a PRP filed a lawsuit against the other PRPs, including CECONY, with respect to the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site. The plaintiff asserts claims pursuant to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and the New York Navigation Law for cleanup costs incurred, and to be incurred, by the plaintiff at the site. The plaintiff estimates the total cleanup costs at the site to be over $1,000 million.\nCECONY is unable to estimate its total exposure to liability for the Gowanus Canal Superfund Site.\nNewtown Creek\nIn June 2017, CECONY received a notice of potential liability from the EPA with respect to the Newtown Creek site that was listed in 2010 on the EPA’s National Priorities List of Superfund sites. The EPA identified 21 PRPs with respect to the site, including CECONY.  Newtown Creek and its tributaries (collectively, Newtown Creek) form a 3.8 mile border between Brooklyn and Queens, New York. Currently, the predominant land use around Newtown Creek includes industrial, petroleum, recycling, manufacturing and distribution facilities and warehouses. Other uses include trucking, concrete manufacture, transportation infrastructure and a wastewater treatment plant. Newtown Creek is near several residential neighborhoods. Six PRPs, not including CECONY, pursuant to an administrative settlement agreement and order on consent the EPA issued to them in 2011, submitted a final remedial investigation report for the site to the EPA in 2023. The EPA indicated that sampling events have shown the sediments in Newtown Creek to be contaminated with a wide variety of hazardous substances including PCBs, metals, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds. The EPA also indicated that it has reason to believe that hazardous substances have come to be released from CECONY facilities into Newtown Creek. The current schedule anticipates completion of a feasibility study for the site during 2027 and issuance of the EPA's record of decision selecting a remedy for the site thereafter. In January 2025, the EPA approved a potential early action remedy for the East Branch tributary of Newtown Creek, which the EPA estimates could cost approximately $250 million to implement. CECONY is unable to estimate its exposure to liability for the Newtown Creek site. \nOther Superfund Sites\nCECONY is a PRP at additional Superfund sites involving other PRPs and participates in PRP groups at those sites. The company generally is not managing the site investigation and remediation at these multiparty sites. Work at these sites is in various stages, and investigation, remediation and monitoring activities at some of these sites can be expected to continue over extended periods of time. The company believes that it is unlikely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.\nThe following table lists each of the additional Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have liability. The table also shows for each such site its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities for the site (shown in the table under “Start”), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings for the site are pending and CECONY’s estimated percentage of the total liability for each site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation, remediation, monitoring and environmental damages in aggregate for the sites below, other than the sites where the percentage of total liability has not been determined, is less than $2 million. Superfund liability is joint and several. The company’s estimate of its liability for each site was determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement agreements or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other PRPs. The company’s actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n41\n                      \nSite\nLocation\nStart\nCourt or\nAgency\n% of Total\nLiability\nCortese Landfill\nNarrowsburg, NY\n1987\nEPA\n6.0%\nCurcio Scrap Metal\nSaddle Brook, NJ\n1987\nEPA\n100.0%\nMetal Bank of America\nPhiladelphia, PA\n1987\nEPA\n1.0%\nGlobal Landfill\nOld Bridge, NJ\n1988\nEPA\n0.4%\nBorne Chemical\nElizabeth, NJ\n1997\nNJDEP\n0.7%\nPure Earth\nVineland, NJ\n2018\nEPA\nto be determined\nBerry's Creek Site (formerly referred to as Scientific Chemical Processing)\nCarlstadt, NJ\n2023\nEPA\n to be determined\nOther Environmental Matters\nIn December 2024, New York State enacted the Climate Change Superfund Act (Act), which requires \"responsible parties\" to pay $75 billion over twenty-five years into a fund based on GHG emissions to finance infrastructure projects needed to address the impacts from climate change. Responsible parties are defined as entities engaged in the trade or business of extracting fossil fuel or refining crude oil and were responsible for more than one billion metric tons of GHG emissions from 2000 to 2018.  Although the Utilities are not a responsible party under this definition, the NYSDEC is required to promulgate regulations i\nmplementing the Act by December 2025. In February 2025, a group of states brought a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, Albany Division, challenging the Act as unconstitutional. As a result, the Companies are unable to predict the potential impact, if any, that the Act may have on them. \nFollowing media reports, in July 2023, the EPA, NYSDEC, New York State Department of Health and NYSDPS began investigating the potential public health risks associated with lead-jacketed cables in the fixed-line telecommunications industry. The use of lead-jacketed electric cables began in the 1880s to protect conducting wires from exposure to the elements. All of the Utilities’ transmission cables that are in service and lead-jacketed are covered with an outer plastic layer and comprise less than 2 percent of CECONY’s transmission system and less than 5 percent of O&R’s transmission system. CECONY installed lead-jacketed cables without an outer plastic layer in its distribution system until the 1980’s. CECONY’s distribution cables that are in service and lead-jacketed may or may not have an outer plastic layer and may be located within a conduit and manhole system, directly buried or strung in the air between poles and comprise less than 14 percent of its distribution system. O&R’s distribution cables are not lead-jacketed. CECONY’s transmission and distribution systems also contain lead-jacketed cables that were retired in place. CECONY continues to replace lead-jacketed distribution cables, as needed, and recover the costs for cable replacements, pursuant to its electric rate plan. The Companies are unable to predict the impact on them, if any, resulting from potential developments to legal or public policy doctrines regarding cable that contains lead.\nIn July 2021, a CECONY feeder failure led to the discharge of thousands of gallons of dielectric fluid from a street manhole in New Rochelle, New York. Dielectric fluid reached nearby streets, properties and the New Rochelle Harbor. CECONY, the U.S. Coast Guard, the NYSDEC and other agencies responded to the incident. CECONY stopped the feeder leak on the same day the discharge occurred and has completed the spill recovery and associated cleanup operations. As a result of the discharge, CECONY received third-party damage claims. The costs associated with this matter are not expected to have a material adverse effect on CECONY’s financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In connection with the incident, CECONY may incur monetary sanctions of more than $0.3 million for violations of certain provisions regulating the discharge of materials into, and for the protection of, the environment.\nO&R\nSuperfund\nThe sites at which O&R has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its manufactured gas sites and the Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that O&R has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against O&R under Superfund, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. \nManufactured Gas Sites\nO&R and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites (O&R MGP Sites) in Orange County and Rockland County, New York. Three of these sites are now owned by parties other than O&R, and have been redeveloped by them for residential, commercial or industrial uses. The NYSDEC is requiring O&R to develop and implement remediation programs for the O&R MGP Sites including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated.\n42\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nO&R has completed remedial investigations and has received the NYSDEC’s decision regarding the remedial work to be performed at all seven of its MGP sites. Of the seven sites, O&R has completed remediation at four sites. Remedial construction was conducted on a portion of one of the remaining sites in 2019 and remedial design is ongoing for the other remaining sites. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on MGP sites could range from $94 million to $154 million.\nSuperfund Sites\nO&R is a PRP at Superfund sites involving other PRPs and participates in PRP groups at those sites. The company is not managing the site investigation and remediation at these multiparty Superfund sites. Work at these sites is in various stages, and investigation, remediation and monitoring activities at some of these sites is expected to continue over extended periods of time. The company believes that it is unlikely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.\nThe following table lists each of the Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have liability. The table also shows for each such site its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities for the site (shown in the table under “Start”), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings for the site are pending and O&R’s estimated percentage of the total liability for each site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation, remediation, monitoring and environmental damages in aggregate for the sites below is less than $1 million. Superfund liability is joint and several. The company’s estimate of its liability for each site was determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement agreements or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other PRPs.

PCBs are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. The Utilities have procedures in place to manage and dispose of oil and equipment containing PCBs properly when they are removed from service.\nWater Quality\nUnder NYSDEC regulations, the operation of CECONY’s generating facilities requires permits for water discharges and water withdrawals. Conditions to the renewal of such permits may include limitations on the operations of the permitted facility or requirements to install certain equipment, the cost of which could be substantial. For information about the company’s generating facilities, see “CECONY – Electric Operations – Electric Facilities” and “Steam Operations – Steam Facilities” above in this Item 1.\nCertain governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters run through portions of CECONY’s service area. Governmental authorities could require entities that released hazardous substances that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of investigation and remediation, which could be substantial.\nAir Quality\nUnder the Clean Air Act and New York State law, certain of CECONY’s facilities qualify as major facilities that are required to obtain Clean Air Act Title V operating permits. Consistent with the governing regulations, CECONY applies to renew these permits prior to their expiration and seeks to modify them when needed. \nUnder Clean Air Act New Source Review (NSR) regulations, an owner of a major facility, including CECONY’s steam and steam-electric generating facilities and certain other CECONY facilities, is required to obtain a permit before making certain modifications to the facility, other than routine maintenance, repair, or replacement, that cause the increase of emissions of pollutants from the facility above specified thresholds. To obtain a permit, the facility owner could be required to install additional pollution controls or otherwise limit emissions from the facility. The company reviews on an on-going basis its planned modifications to its facilities to determine the potential applicability of NSR and similar regulations.\n \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n43\n                      \nThe EPA's Transport Rule (also referred to as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule), which was implemented in January 2015, established a new cap-and-trade program requiring further reductions in air emissions than the Clean Air Intrastate Rule (CAIR) that it replaced. Under the Transport Rule, utilities are to be allocated emissions allowances and may sell the allowances or buy additional allowances. CECONY requested and received NYSPSC approval to change the provisions under which the company recovers its purchased power costs to provide for costs incurred to purchase emissions allowances and revenues received from the sale of allowances. In 2021, the EPA finalized changes to the Transport Rule in response to a court decision. In 2023, the EPA finalized an updated version of the Transport Rule (known as the Good Neighbor Rule) that includes a more recent federal ozone standard than the Transport Rule initially implemented. Since its promulgation, the Good Neighbor Rule has been the subject of litigation in the federal Circuit Courts of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a request to stay the Good Neighbor Rule while judicial review over its merits was ongoing in the D.C. Circuit. While the EPA interpreted the Supreme Court’s stay to only apply to the applicants in the Supreme Court proceeding, the EPA issued a rule staying the Good Neighbor Rule nationwide while the litigation played out, due to concerns over the administrative complexity of implementing the Supreme Court’s stay. While the Good Neighbor Rule is stayed, the EPA is allocating allowances based on the 2021 Transport Rule, with certain modifications. The revised Transport Rule reduced the number of allowances allocated to CECONY and required the company to purchase allowances to offset the decreased allocation. CECONY expects to comply with the Transport Rule in 2024 and 2025. \nThe NYSDEC issued regulations in 2019 that limit nitrous oxides (NOx) emissions during the ozone season from May through September and affect older peaking units that are generally located downstate and needed during periods of high electric demand or for local reliability purposes.  See “CECONY – Electric Operations – Electric Supply,” above. \nEnvironmental Matters\nFor information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see “Environmental Matters” in Item 1, \"Air Quality,\" above and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8.\nState Anti-Takeover Law\nNew York State law provides that a “domestic corporation,” such as Con Edison, may not consummate a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with the beneficial owner of a 20 percent or greater voting stock interest in the corporation, or with an affiliate of the owner, for five years after the acquisition of the voting stock interest, unless the transaction or the acquisition of the voting stock interest was approved by the corporation’s board of directors prior to the acquisition of the voting stock interest. After the expiration of the five-year period, the transaction may be consummated only pursuant to a stringent “fair price” formula or with the approval of a majority of the disinterested stockholders.\nHuman Capital\nCon Edison is committed to attracting, developing and retaining a talented and highly skilled workforce, recognizing that different backgrounds, experiences and leadership styles offer many advantages to the business. The company values and supports a wide range of employee needs and interests, and its skilled and experienced workforce enables the company to maintain best-in-class reliability and progress towards achieving a clean energy future. Human capital measures focus on employee safety, as well as inclusive practices that provide equal employment opportunity in hiring, development, promotion and retention. \nOn December 31, 2\n024, Con Edison and its subsidiaries had \n15,097\n employees, based entirely in the United States including \n13,891\n at CECONY; \n1,196\n at O&R and \n10\n at Con Edison Transmission. Of the total CECONY and O&R employees, \n7,776\n and \n599\n employees, respectively, were covered by a collective b\nargaining agreement. The collective bargaining agreement covering most of the CECONY employees expires in June 2028.\n Agreements covering other CECONY employees and O&R employees expire in June 2025 and May 2026, respectively. \nCon Edison measures the voluntary attrition rate of its employees in assessing the company’s overall human capital. The company's turnover rate in 2024 was approximately 6.2 percent, 37 percent of which is attributed to retirements. The average length of service is 13.1 years. Con Edison has a diverse workforce, and strives to cultivate and maintain an inclusive work environment where employees of varying backgrounds, cultures and experiences are treated with dignity and respect. Con Edison is required to submit information annually to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In its most recent Employer Information Report, as of December 31, 2023,  women represented 23.2 percent of the total workforce and people of color represented 53.6 percent of the workforce, with ethnicity breaking down as follows: 46.4 percent White, 23.3 percent Black, 19.3 percent Hispanic, 9.8 percent Asian and 1.2 percent other.\n44\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n \nIn managing the business, the company emphasizes a strong safety culture. Continuous focus on safety while performing work is paramount, and leaders and managers are committed to implementing programs and practices that promote the right knowledge, skills, and attitudes to undertake the responsibilities of safety, including required training for both field and office employees. To that end, the company has a dedicated facility, the Learning Center, that offers classes to employees covering technical courses, skills enhancement, safety and leadership development. During 2024, employees s\npent over 750,000 hours \nin instructor-led, leadership and skill-based training. Further, the company maintains a career development and succes\nsion planning program that is committed to helping employees grow their careers, talents, skills and abilities. In addition to their daily job functions, employees of the Utilities are assigned to and trained for a position for emergency response that is mobilized in the event of a weather event or emergency.\nAlthough working remotely for certain positions has been made possible by digital software and smart device capabilities that enable employees to collaborate with each other and remain productive, the entire CECONY and O&R workforce is available in the event of an emergency that requires on-site presence. \nAvailable Information\nFor the sources of information about the Companies, see “Available Information” in the “Introduction” appearing before this Item 1.",
  "item7": "Item 7:    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis combined management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) relates to the consolidated financial statements included in this report of two separate registrants: Con Edison and CECONY, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto. As used in this report, the term the “Companies” refers to Con Edison and CECONY. CECONY is a subsidiary of Con Edison and, as such, information in this management’s discussion and analysis about CECONY applies to Con Edison.\nThis\n combined MD&A generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. For discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022, see “Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in Con Edison’s and CECONY’s combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024.\nInformation in any item of this report referred to in this discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as “see” or “refer to” shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made.\nCorporate Overview\nCon Edison’s principal business operations are those of the Utilities and Con Edison Transmission. CECONY is a regulated utility that provides electric service in New York City and New York's Westchester County, gas service in Manhattan, the Bronx, parts of Queens and parts of Westchester, and steam service in Manhattan. O&R is a regulated utility serving customers in a 1,300-square-mile-area in southeastern New York State and northern New Jersey. Con Edison Transmission, through its subsidiaries, invests in electric transmission projects and manages, through joint ventures, both electric and gas assets while seeking to develop electric transmission projects. Con Edison Transmission is considering strategic alternatives with respect to its investment in MVP and both Con Edison Transmission and CECONY are considering strategic alternatives with respect to their investments in Honeoye. See “Con Edison Transmission” in Item 1.  \nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A and the Companies’ material contingencies described in Notes B, G and H to the financial statements in Item 8, the Companies’ management considers the following events, trends, and uncertainties to be important to understanding the Companies’ current and future financial condition.\nClean Energy Goals \nThe success of the Companies’ efforts to meet federal, state and city clean energy policy goals and the impact of energy consumers' efforts to meet such goals on CECONY’s electric, gas and steam businesses and O&R’s electric and gas businesses may impact the Companies’ future financial condition. The Utilities expect electric usage to increase and gas and steam usage to decrease in their service territories as federal, state and local laws and policies are enacted and implemented that aim to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy that is consumed in their respective jurisdictions. The Utilities’ and their regulators’ efforts to maintain electric reliability in their service territories as electric usage increases may also impact the Companies’ future financial condition. The long-term future of the Utilities’ gas businesses depends upon the role that natural gas or other gaseous fuels will play in facilitating New York State’s and New York City’s climate goals. In addition, the impact and costs from climate change impacts on the Utilities’ systems and the success of the Utilities’ efforts to maintain system reliability and manage service interruptions resulting from severe weather may impact the Companies’ future financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. \nAged Accounts Receivable Balances\nAt December 31, 2024, CECONY’s and O&R’s customer accounts receivables balances of $2,947 million and $113 million, respectively, included aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $1,652 million and $32 million, respectively. In comparison, CECONY’s and O&R’s customer accounts receivable balances at February 28, 2020 were $1,322 million and $89 million, respectively, including aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $408 million and $15 million, respectively. Prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Utilities’ practice was to write off customer accounts receivables as uncollectible 90 days after the account is disconnected for non-payment or the account is closed during the collection process. In general, the Utilities suspended collection activities and service disconnections during the COVID-19 pandemic and have since resumed such activities.\nCECONY’s rate plans include reconciliation of late payment charges (from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025 for electric and gas and from January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2026 for steam) and write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances (from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2025 for electric and gas and from \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n55\n                      \nJanuary 1, 2020 through October 31, 2026 for steam) to amounts reflected in rates, with recovery/refund from or to customers via surcharge/sur-credit. CECONY's surcharge recoveries for late payment charges and write-offs of accounts receivable balances will, collectively, be subject to separate annual caps for electric and gas that produce no more than a half percent (0.5 percent) total customer bill impact per commodity (estimated for electric to be $57.3 million, $60.3 million, $62.6 million for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, and for gas to be $14.8 million, $15.9 million and $16.8 million for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively). CECONY's surcharge recoveries for late payment charges and write-offs of accounts receivables for steam will each be subject to an annual cap that produces no more than half percent (0.5 percent) total customer bill impact (estimated to be $2.5 million, $3.0 million and $3.5 million for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively). Am\nounts in excess of the surcharge caps will be d\neferred as a regulatory asset for recovery in CECONY’s next base rate cases. \nO&R’s 2022 - 2024 rate plans included reconciliation of late payment charges to amounts reflected in rates for years 2022 through 2024, with full recovery/refund via surcharge/sur-credit once the annual variance equals or exceeds 5 basis points of return on equity and reconciliation of write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances to amounts reflected in rates from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024, with full recovery/refund via surcharge/sur-credit once the annual variance equals or exceeds 5 basis points of return on equity. O&R’s November 2024 joint proposal, that is subject to approval by the NYSPSC, includes reconciliation of uncollectible expenses and late payment charges that are subject to a combined annual threshold of $0.9 million and $0.5 million for electric and gas, respectively. Once the threshold is met, O&R will defer the variance between actual uncollectible expense and late payment charge, and the level set forth in rates that is above the threshold. Recovery/refunds will be made via surcharge/sur-credit. Surcharge recovery is subject to an annual cap that produces no more than a 0.5 percent total customer bill impact per commodity. Amounts in excess of the surcharge caps will be deferred as a regulatory asset for recovery in O&R’s next base rate cases.\nAlthough these regulatory mechanisms are in place, a continued increase in accounts receivable balances has impacted and is expected to continue to impact the Companies’ liquidity. See “The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities' Rate Pans\" in Item 1A, “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Capital Requirements and Resources,” below and \"Regulatory Matters – Rate Plans\" in Note B and Note N to \nthe financial statements in Item 8.\nIn particular, CECONY, in an effort to reduce aged accounts receivables balances, plans to continue to execute on its integrated collections strategy, which includes, among other things, implementation of payment arrangements, enhanced digital and mail communications to customers regarding collections, increased field collections by hiring new field collectors and increasing collector efficiency and employing additional call center representatives to handle in-bound call volumes. O&R's collection strategy aligns with that of CECONY's in many respects.      \nCon Edison Transmission\nCon Edison Transmission, through its New York Transco partnership and jointly with the NYPA, is developing the Propel NY Energy transmission project, a 90-mile electric transmission project that is expected to increase high voltage transmission connections between Long Island and the rest of New York State. Con Edison Transmission is also participating in competitive solicitations to develop additional electric projects, including a proposal submitted in April 2024 with another entity to build infrastructure that will facilitate future transmission to be installed for offshore wind power to New Jersey's electric grid and multiple proposals submitted in June 2024 through its New York Transco partnership to integrate electricity produced from offshore wind into New York City's energy grid. The success of Con Edison Transmission’s efforts in these competitive solicitations and to grow its electric transmission portfolio may impact Con Edison’s future capital requirements. In January 2025, the President of the United States issued an executive order temporarily withdrawing all areas on the outer continental shelf from new offshore wind leasing, pending review by the new Administration, noting that nothing in this withdrawal affects rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas, and further that with respect to such existing leases, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Attorney General as needed, shall conduct a comprehensive review of the ecological, economic, and environmental necessity of terminating or amending any existing wind energy leases. See \"Federal Regulation\" in Item 1. Con Edison Transmission is considering strategic alternatives with respect to its investment in MVP and both Con Edison Transmission and CECONY are considering strategic alternatives with respect to their investments in Honeoye. See \"Con Edison Transmission\" in Item 1.    \nCertain financial data of Con Edison’s businesses are presented below:\n56\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nAt December 31, 2024\n(Millions of Dollars,\nexcept percentages)\nOperating\nRevenues\nNet Income for \nCommon Stock\nAssets\nCECONY\n$14,129\n93 \n%\n$1,748\n96 \n%\n$65,650\n92 \n%\nO&R\n1,125\n7 \n%\n104\n6 \n%\n4,060\n6 \n%\nTotal Utilities\n15,254\n100 \n%\n1,852\n102 \n%\n69,710\n98 \n%\nCon Edison Transmission\n4\n— \n%\n45\n2 \n%\n469\n1 \n%\nOther (a)\n(2)\n— \n%\n(77)\n(4)\n%\n383\n1 \n%\nTotal Con Edison\n$15,256\n100\n \n%\n$1,820\n100\n \n%\n$70,562\n100\n \n%\n(a)\nOther includes the parent company, \nCon Edison’s tax equity investments, consolidation adjustments and Broken Bow II, the deferred project held for sale at December 31, 2024, the sale and transfer of which was completed in January 2025. Net income for common stock for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes $(46) million (after-tax) for adjustments related to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X to the financial statements in Item 8.\nInflation Reduction Act\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law and implemented a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) that imposes a 15 percent tax on modified GAAP net income. Under the IRA, a corporation is subject to the CAMT if its average annual adjusted financial statement income for the three taxable year period ending prior to the taxable year exceeds $1,000 million, and applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. \nPursuant to the IRA, corporations are entitled to a tax credit (minimum tax credit) to the extent the CAMT liability exceeds the regular tax liability. This amount can be carried forward indefinitely and used in future years when regular tax exceeds the CAMT.\nBeginning in 2024, based on the existing statue, the Companies are subject to and report the CAMT in their Consolidated Income Statements, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companies accrued a CAMT liability of $139 million, $111 million of which is for CECONY, before the application of general business credits with an offsetting deferred tax asset representing the minimum tax credit carryforward, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Companies are continuing to assess the impacts of the IRA on their financial statements and will update estimates based on future guidance to be issued by the Department of the Treasury.\nNew York Legislation\nIn April 2021, New York passed a law that increased the corporate franchise tax rate on business income from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent, retroactive to January 1, 2021, for taxpayers with taxable income greater than $5 million. The law also reinstated the business capital tax at 0.1875 percent, not to exceed a maximum tax liability of $5 million per taxpayer. New York requires a corporate franchise taxpayer to calculate and pay the highest amount of tax under the three alternative methods: a tax on business income; a tax on business capital; or a fixed dollar minimum. The provisions to increase the corporate franchise tax rate and reinstate a capital tax were scheduled to expire after 2023. In May 2023, New York passed a law that extended the increase in the corporate franchise tax rate from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent for an additional three years, through tax year 2026 and extended the business capital tax through tax year 2026.  New York also passed a law establishing a permanent rate of 30 percent for the metropolitan transportation business tax surcharge. As a result of the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses in 2023, Con Edison's New York State taxable income was higher than $5 million and subject to the higher 7.25 percent rate (9.425 percent with the surcharge rate) on its taxable income for tax year 2023, but is not subject to the higher rate in tax year 2024.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n57\n                      \nResults of Operations\nNet income for common stock and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n(Millions of Dollars,\nexcept per share amounts)\nNet Income for\nCommon Stock\nEarnings per Share\n  \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCECONY\n$1,748\n$1,606\n$5.05 \n$4.62 \nO&R\n104\n96\n0.30 \n0.28 \nClean Energy Businesses (a)\n—\n22\n— \n0.07 \nCon Edison Transmission (b)\n45\n37\n0.13 \n0.11 \nOther (c)\n(77)\n758\n(0.22)\n2.17 \nCon Edison (d)\n$1,820\n$2,519\n$5.26\n \n$7.25\n \n(a)\nNet income for common stock and earnings per share from the Clean Energy Businesses for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflects\n $2 million or $0.01 a share (after-tax) of the effects of HLBV accounting for tax equity investments in certain renewable electric projects.

Effective November 1, 2023, revenues from CECONY’s steam sales are also subject to a weather normalization clause, as a result of which, delivery revenues reflect normal weather conditions during the heating season. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying \nenergy to their full-service customers. Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect Con Edison’s results of operations.\nb.

Increases in aged accounts receivable balances, inflationary pressure and higher interest rates have increased the amount of capital needed by the Utilities and the costs of such\n capital. See \"Interest Rate Risk,\" below, \"Aged Accounts Receivable Balances,\" above and \"Capital Resources,\" below.\nCon Edison and the Utilities have a $2,500 million revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) in place under which banks are committed to provide loans on a revolving credit basis until March 2029, unless extended for an additional one-year term, subject to certain conditions. CECONY has a $500 million 364-day revolving credit agreement (the CECONY Credit Agreement) in place under which banks are committed to provide loans on a revolving credit basis until March 2025, subject to certain conditions. Con Edison and the Utilities have not entered into any loans under the Credit Agreement and CECONY has not entered into any loans under the CECONY Credit Agreement.\nIn November 2024 and January 2025, CECONY borrowed $500 million and $200 million, respectively, at a variable\nrate under a 364-Day Senior Unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement entered into by the company in November 2024 (the CECONY Term Loan Credit Agreement). The term loans mature in November 2025.\nCECONY has the option to prepay the term loans issued under the CECONY Term Loan Credit Agreement prior to\nmaturity. \nFERC has authorized CECONY through April 30, 2026 and O&R through July 31, 2026 to issue short-term borrowings for a period of not more than 12 months, in an amount not to exceed $4,000 million and $250 million, respectively, at prevailing market rates.\nThe Companies’ liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statements of cash flows and as discussed below.\nThe principal factors affecting Con Edison’s liquidity are its investments in the Utilities and Con Edison Transmission, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from its subsidiaries and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.\nThe principal factors affecting CECONY’s liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including capital expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.\nThe Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities’ cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers.\nEach of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements.

The volume of energy sales and deliveries is primarily affected by factors external to the Utilities, such as customer demand, weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. Measures that promote distributed energy resources, such as distributed generation, demand reduction and energy efficiency, also affect the volume of energy sales and deliveries. See \"Competition\" and \"Environmental Matters – Clean Energy Future\" and “Environmental Matters – Climate Change” in Item 1.\nPursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities have recovered from customers a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, as the Companies are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities at the current corporate tax rate for the temporary differences. For the Utilities, credits to their customers of the net benefits of the TCJA, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, decrease cash flows from operating activities. Pursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities also recover from customers the amount of property taxes they will pay. The payment of property taxes by the Utilities affects the timing of cash flows and increases the amount of short-term borrowings issued by the Utilities when property taxes are due and as property taxes increase, but generally does not impact net income.\n \nSee “Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies” in Item 1A, “Federal Income Tax” in Note A, “Rate Plans” in Note B, “Other Regulatory Matters” in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8.\nIn general, the Utilities suspended service disconnections during the COVID-19 pandemic and have since resumed such activities in accordance with applicable law. At December 31, 2024, CECONY’s and O&R’s customer accounts receivables balances of $2,947 million and $113 million, respectively, included aged accounts receivables (balances outstanding in excess of 60 days) of $1,652 million and $32 million, respectively. A continued increase in accounts receivable balances has impacted and is expected to continue to impact the Companies’ liquidity. See “Aged Accounts Receivable Balances,” above. \nOn March 1, 2023, Con Edison completed the sale of all of the stock of the Clean Energy Businesses. See Note W and Note X to the financial statements in Item 8.\nNet income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) tra\nnsactions. O\nnly cash transactions affect the Companies’ cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense, amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities and accrued unbilled revenue. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities’ New York electric and gas rate plans\n. See “Rate Plans – CECONY– Electric and Gas\" and \"Rate Plans – O&R New York – Electric and Gas” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. \nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified within the Companies' cash flows from operating activities to conform with current period presentation.\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2024 for Con Edison were $1,458 million higher than in 2023. The changes in net cash flows for Con Edison primarily reflect:\n•\nlower net deferred charges, noncurrent assets, leases and other regulatory liabilities balances of $682 million; \n•\nan increase in accounts payable of $284 million;\n•\na decrease in prepayments of $225 million;\n•\na decrease in unbilled revenue and net unbilled revenue deferrals of $123 million;\n•\na decrease in the revenue decoupling mechanism receivable of $39 million;\n•\nan in\ncrease in accrued interest of \n$35 million; and\n•\nan increase in accrued taxes of $8 million.\nNet cash flows from operating activities in 2024 for CECONY were $1,073 million higher than in 2023. The changes in net cash flows for CECONY primarily reflect:\n•\nlower net deferred charges, noncurrent assets, leases, net and other regulatory assets of $713 million;\n•\nlower other receivables and other current assets of $220 million; and\n•\nan increase in accounts payable of $145 million; \nThe change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing is reflected within changes to accounts receivable – customers, recoverable and refundable energy costs within other regulatory assets and liabilities and accounts payable balances.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n71\n                      \nThe following table summarizes key components of Con Edison's cash flows used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n  \nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Millions of Dollars)\n2024\n2023\nVariance\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES\nUtility capital expenditures\n$(4,770)\n$(4,353)\n$(417)\nCost of removal less salvage\n(474)\n(387)\n(87)\nNon-utility capital expenditures\n(1)\n(141)\n140\nProceeds from sale of the Clean Energy Businesses, net of cash and cash equivalents sold\n—\n3,927\n(3,927)\nOther investing activities\n(28)\n(49)\n21\nNET CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n$(5,273)\n$(1,003)\n$(4,270)\nNet cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison were $4,270 million higher in 2024 than in 2023.

None of the Companies' other transactions, agreements or contractual arrangements meet the SEC definition of off-balance sheet arrangements.\n76\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nRegulatory Matters\nFor information about the Utilities’ rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see “Utility Regulation” in Item 1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.\n \nRisk Factors\nThe Companies’ businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, that may be beyond their control and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.\nCritical Accounting Estimates \nThe Companies’ financial statements reflect the application of certain critical accounting estimates, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies’ critical accounting estimates include assumptions applied to accounting for: pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, derivative instruments, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, asset retirement obligations and income taxes. Also, see “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Matters” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. \nAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edison Transmission also provides such benefits to transferred employees who previously worked for the Utilities. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. In addition, the Utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about the Companies’ pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nThe discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of Aa rated (by either Moody’s or S&P) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments.\nIn determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends.\nThe cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edison’s and CECONY’s current estimates for 2025 are decreases, compared with 2024, in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $254 million and $236 million, respectively, largely driven by increases in the discount rates used to determine plan liabilities. See Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.\n \nThe following table illustrates the effect on 2025 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant:\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n77\n                      \nActuarial Assumption\nChange in\nAssumption\nPension\nOther\nPostretirement\nBenefits\nTotal\n \n \n(Millions of Dollars)\nIncrease in accounting cost:\nDiscount rate\nCon Edison\n(0.25)\n%\n$34\n$2\n$36\nCECONY\n(0.25)\n%\n$32\n$1\n$33\nExpected return on plan assets\nCon Edison\n(0.25)\n%\n$41\n$3\n$44\nCECONY\n(0.25)\n%\n$40\n$2\n$42\nFuture compensation increases\nCon Edison\n0.50 \n%\n$27\n$—\n$27\nCECONY\n0.50 \n%\n$27\n$—\n$27\nHealth care trend rate\nCon Edison\n1.00 \n%\n$—\n$13\n$13\nCECONY\n1.00 \n%\n$—\n$11\n$11\nIncrease in projected benefit obligation:\nDiscount rate\nCon Edison\n(0.25)\n%\n$356\n$22\n$378\nCECONY\n(0.25)\n%\n$339\n$18\n$357\nFuture compensation increases\nCon Edison\n0.50 \n%\n$128\n$—\n$128\nCECONY\n0.50 \n%\n$125\n$—\n$125\nHealth care trend rate\nCon Edison\n1.00 \n%\n$—\n$72\n$72\nCECONY\n1.00 \n%\n$— \n$62\n$62\nA 5 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2025, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 6.75 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison and CECONY by approximately $26 million and $25 million, respectively, in 2026.\nPension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which CECONY, O&R and Con Edison Transmission may make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets.\nThe Companies’ policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2024 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, CECONY and O&R made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2024 of $17 million and $3 million, respectively. In 2025, O&R expects to make contributions to the pension plan of $3 million. See “Expected Contributions” in Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.\nAccounting for Contingencies\n78\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nThe accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (Note B), the Utilities’ responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G) and other contingencies (Note H). Inputs to the estimation of the liability for such environmental remediation include the possible selected remedy for each site where investigation is ongoing, the inflation rate related to the cost of inputs to the remediation process, and for those sites where there are other potentially responsible parties, the allocation of costs to the Companies. Inputs to the estimation of the liability for certain regulatory matters include facts specific to each item and the status and progress of discussions with the applicable state regulator. Inputs to the estimation of the liability for other contingencies may include liabilities incurred for similar circumstances and the outcome of legal proceedings. In accordance with the accounting rules, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.\nThe Utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers’ compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Generally, changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments\nThe Companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See “Financial and Commodity Market Risks,” below and Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8.\nWhere the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources. See Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nThe Companies develop expected loss estimates using past events data and consider current conditions and future reasonable and supportable forecasts. For the Utilities’ customer accounts receivable allowance for uncollectible accounts, including current accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenue, past events considered include write-offs relative to customer accounts receivable; current conditions include macro-and micro-economic conditions related to trends in the local economy, bankruptcy rates and current and aged customer accounts receivable balances, including final balances, among other factors; and forecasts about the future include assumptions related to the level of write-offs and recoveries. From January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2024, the historical write-off rate was determined based, in part, on a historical weather event with a significant impact to the Companies’ service territory. During that period, Con Edison's and CECONY's allowances for uncollectible accounts increased from $70 million and $65 million, respectively to $620 million and $605 million, respectively. See “The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities’ Rate Plans” in Item 1A, “Aged Accounts Receivable Balances” in Item 7 and “Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts\" in Note N to the financial statements in Item 8. \nAsset Retirement Obligations (AROs)\nAROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. CECONY and O&R, as rate-regulated entities, recognize Regulatory Assets or Liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recording of costs and costs recovered through the ratemaking process. Because quoted market prices are not available for AROs, the Companies estimate the fair value of AROs by calculating discounted cash flows that are dependent upon various assumptions including estimated retirement dates, discount rates, inflation rates, the timing and amount of future cash outlays, and currently available technologies. \nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n79\n                      \nThe Companies recorded asset retirement obligations associated with the removal of asbestos and asbestos-containing material in their buildings (other than the structures enclosing generating stations and substations), electric equipment and steam and gas distribution systems. The Companies also recorded asset retirement obligations relating to gas and oil pipelines abandoned in place and municipal infrastructure support. See Note T to the financial statements in Item 8.\nA 1 percent increase in the assumed inflation rate used to value the ARO liability as of December 31, 2024 would increase the liability by $27 million for Con Edison and CECONY.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nThe Companies record provisions for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets, if any, and reserves for uncertain tax positions. The reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities requires the use of estimates and significant judgments by management. Deferred federal and state tax assets and liabilities are recorded to represent future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the basis of assets for financial reporting and tax purposes. Although management believes that current estimates for deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates for several reasons, including, but not limited to: a change in forecasted financial condition and/or results of operations; changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates or amounts subject to income tax or state apportionments; the form, structure, and timing of asset or stock sales or dispositions; changes in the regulatory treatment of any tax reform benefits; and changes resulting from audits and examinations by taxing authorities. Valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when management concludes it is more likely than not such tax benefit will not be realized in future periods. Accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. Management evaluates each position solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming that the position will be examined by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine recognition thresholds and the related amount of tax benefits to be recognized. At each period end, and as new developments occur, management reevaluates its tax positions. Additional interpretations, regulations, amendments, or technical corrections related to the federal income tax code as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, may impact the estimates for income taxes discussed above. See “Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies” in Item 1A, “Inflation Reduction Act” above, “Federal Income Tax” and “State Income Tax” in Note A and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. \nFinancial and Commodity Market Risks\nThe Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and investment risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Companies' interest rate risk primarily relates to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the capital expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities, and variable-rate debt. Con Edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at December 31, 2024 and 2023\n, a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $15 million and $12 million, respectively. Unde\nr CECONY’s current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense, including costs associated with the refinancing of the variable rate tax-exempt debt, are reconciled to levels reflected in rates.\nHigher interest rates have resulted in increased interest expense on commercial paper, variable-rate debt and long-term debt issuances.\nCommodity Price Risk\nCon Edison’s commodity price risk primarily relates to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note P to the financial statements in Item 8.\n80\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nCon Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2024, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $150 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $137 million is for CECONY and $13 million is for O&R. As of December 31, 2023, Con Edison estimated that a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $149 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $138 million is for CECONY and $11 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. \nThe Utilities do not make any margin or profit on the electricity or gas they sell. In accordance with provisions\napproved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from full-service customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for those customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. However, increases in electric and gas commodity prices may contribute to a slower recovery of cash from outstanding customer accounts receivable balances. \nInvestment Risk\nThe Companies’ investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Con Edison's investment risk also relates to the investments of Con Edison Transmission that are accounted for under the equity method. See “Critical Accounting Estimates – Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,” above and “Investments” in Note A and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. \nThe Companies’ current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 26 to 30 percent equity securities, 42 to 60 percent debt securities, 14 to 30 percent alternatives. At December 31, 2024, the pension plan investments consisted of 27 percent equity securities, 51 percent debt securities and 22 percent alternatives.\nFor the Utilities’ pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. In accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between the pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. O&R also defers such difference pursuant to its New York rate plans.\nEnvironmental Matters\nFor information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see “Environmental Matters” in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8.\nMaterial Contingencies\nFor information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies’ material contingencies, see “Critical Accounting Estimates – Accounting for Contingencies,” above, and Notes B, G and H to the financial statements in Item 8.\nCON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2024\n81",
