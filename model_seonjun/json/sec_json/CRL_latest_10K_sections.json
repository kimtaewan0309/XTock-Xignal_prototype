Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. was incorporated in 1994 and we completed our initial public offering in 2000. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CRL” and is included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 and Composite 1500 indices, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca Biotechnology Index, the NYSE Composite and many of the Russell indices, among others. We are headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts. Our headquarters mailing address is 251 Ballardvale Street, Wilmington, MA, 01887, and the telephone number at that location is (781) 222-6000. Our Internet site is www.criver.com. Material contained on our Internet site is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Form 10-K to “Charles River,” “we,” “us,” “the Company” or “our” refer to Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nThis Form 10-K, as well as all other reports filed with the SEC, is available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our Internet site (www.criver.com) as soon as practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.\nOverview\nWe are a leading, non-clinical global drug development partner with a mission to create healthier lives. We have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and non-GLP, that supports our clients from target identification through non-clinical development. We also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities. Utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more efficient and flexible drug development model, which reduces their costs, enhances their productivity and effectiveness, and increases speed to market.\nThe development of new drugs requires a steadily increasing investment of time and money. Various studies and reports estimate that it takes between 10 to 15 years, up to $2.5 billion excluding time costs and exploration of between 10,000 and 15,000 drug molecules to produce a single Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug. \nDiscovery represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences, directed at the identification, screening, and selection of a lead molecule for future drug development. Discovery activities typically extend anywhere from 4 to 7 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) timelines.\nDevelopment activities, which follow, and which can take up to 7 to 10 years, are directed at demonstrating the safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of the selected drug candidates. During the non-clinical stage of the development process, a drug candidate is tested \nin vitro\n (non-animal, typically on a cellular or sub-cellular level in a test tube or multi-well petri plate) and \nin vivo\n (in research models) to establish drug safety prior to and in support of human clinical trials.\nFor over 75 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in the research and development of new drugs, devices and therapies. Over this time, we have built upon our core competency of \nin vivo\n biology to develop a diverse and expanding portfolio of products and services, which now encompasses the broader non-clinical drug research process. We are positioned to leverage our leading portfolio in non-clinical drug research in an efficient and cost-effective way to aid our clients in bringing their drugs to market faster.\nOur client base includes major global pharmaceutical companies, many biotechnology companies; \nagricultural and industrial chemical, life science, veterinary medicine, medical device, diagnostic and consumer product companies; contract research and contract manufacturing organizations; and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions, and government agencies\n around the world. In recent years, we have focused our efforts on improving the efficiency of our global operations to enhance our ability to support our clients. Our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients are increasingly seeking full service, “one-stop” global partners to whom they can outsource more of their drug discovery and development efforts. It is estimated that the market for regulated safety assessment services is 60% outsourced or more, while emerging growth areas such as discovery and certain research model services are currently believed to be less outsourced.\nWe currently operate in over 130 sites and in over 20 countries worldwide (excluding certain Insourcing Solutions sites). Our products and services, supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise, enable our clients to overcome many of the challenges of non-clinical life sciences research. In 2024, our total revenue was $4.0 billion. As part of our efforts to manage the Company through the current demand environment, we have undertaken a comprehensive review of our global footprint. Through these optimization initiatives, we expect to close or consolidate approximately 15 additional sites over the next two years, principally focused on the DSA and RMS segments. These footprint optimization efforts will enhance the efficiency and economies of scale in our global infrastructure, leading to a more disciplined operating model.\n2\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nWe have three reportable segments: Research Models and Services (RMS), Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA) and Manufacturing Solutions (Manufacturing).\nThrough our RMS segment, we have provided foundational tools for the discovery of new molecules by supplying research models to the drug development industry since 1947. We continue to maintain our position as a global leader in the production and sale of the most widely used research models, including over 140 different stocks and strains of purpose-bred rodents. We also provide a variety of related services that are designed to support our clients in the use of research models in drug discovery and development. We maintain multiple production centers, including barrier rooms and isolator facilities, on three continents (North America, Europe, and Asia). We are also a premier provider of high quality, purpose bred, large research models to the biomedical research community. \nOur RMS segment also includes our \nInsourcing Solutions \nbusiness, which includes our CRADL\n™\n (Charles River Accelerator and Development Lab) footprint. \nIn 2024, RMS accounted for 20.5% of our total revenue and approximately 4,100 of our employees, including approximately 200 science professionals with advanced degrees.\nOur DSA segment provides services that enable our clients to outsource their innovative drug discovery research, their related non-clinical and clinical bioanalytical activities, and regulatory-required safety testing of potential new drugs, vaccines, industrial and agricultural chemicals, consumer products, veterinary medicines and medical devices. The demand for these services is driven by the needs of large global pharmaceutical companies where outsourcing may complement internal activities, in addition to mid-size and emerging biotechnology/biopharma pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, academic institutions, contract research organizations, and industrial and agrochemical companies and non-governmental organizations that rely more heavily on outsourcing partners. Many of these entities choose to outsource their discovery, development, bioanalytical and/or safety assessment activities to reduce fixed costs and to gain access to scientific expertise, robust capabilities, and regulatory experience. \nWe are the largest provider of outsourced drug discovery, non-clinical development and regulated safety testing services worldwide. We have extensive expertise in the discovery of clinical candidates and in the design, execution and reporting of safety assessment studies for numerous types of therapeutic modalities, including cell and gene therapies, small and large molecule pharmaceuticals, industrial and agricultural chemicals, vaccines, consumer products, veterinary medicines, biocides and medical devices. We currently provide discovery and safety assessment services at multiple facilities located in the United States (U.S.), Canada, and Europe. In 2024, our DSA segment represented 60.5% of our total revenue and employed approximately 12,100 of our employees including approximately 1,500 science professionals with advanced degrees. \nWithin our Manufacturing segment, we work with our clients and the biopharmaceutical industry to ensure the quality and safe production and release of commercial therapies and products manufactured both by our clients and internally for our clients. Our Manufacturing Segment is comprised of two businesses: Microbial Solutions and Biologics Solutions. Our Microbial Solutions products and services businesses provide \nin vitro\n methods for conventional and rapid quality control testing of sterile and non-sterile pharmaceuticals and consumer products. Biologics Solutions is comprised of both our Biologics Testing Solutions business, which provides specialized testing of biologics frequently outsourced by global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and our contract development and manufacturing products and services (“CDMO”) business, which provides comprehensive contract development and manufacturing solutions for cell and gene therapies. In 2024, Manufacturing accounted for 19.0% of our total revenue from continuing operations and approximately 2,800 of our employees, including approximately 380 science professionals with advanced degrees. \nResearch Models and Services\n. Our RMS segment is comprised of three businesses that provide foundational tools that enable our clients to discover new molecules: Research Models, Research Model Services and Cell Solutions.\nResearch Models\n. Our Research Models business is principally comprised of the production and sale of the most widely used small research models, primarily rodents. A significant portion of our Research Models business involves the commercial production and sale of small research models, principally purpose-bred rats and mice for use by researchers in fundamental biology through to drug discovery and development. The FDA and foreign regulatory agencies typically require that the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans. As a result, our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process. \nWe provide our research models to numerous clients around the world, including most pharmaceutical companies, a broad range of biotechnology companies, contract research organizations and many government agencies, hospitals, and academic institutions. We have a global footprint with production facilities strategically located in 7 countries, in close proximity to major biohubs and client concentrations. Our research models include commonly used laboratory strains, disease models and specialized strains with compromised immune systems, which are in demand as early-stage tools in the drug research and development process. \nThe research models we supply have been, and continue to be, some of the most extensively used in the world, largely as a result of our geographic footprint and continuous commitment to innovation, quality, and biosecurity. Our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments, which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and \n3\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nbacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort scientific results. With our production capabilities, we are able to deliver consistently high-quality research models worldwide. \nOur small research models include inbred, outbred, and hybrid strains, as well as mutant strains, genetically engineered models and humanized models with biological features, which enable research aims. Certain of our research models are proprietary rodent models used to research treatments in several therapeutic areas. We are also a premier provider of high quality, purpose bred, large research models to the biomedical research community. While we provide some non-human primates directly to clients who utilize them primarily for safety testing of new therapies, most of the non-human primates associated with our business are utilized in connection with our clients’ studies conducted by our Safety Assessment services in our DSA business. In both cases - non-human primates we provide directly to clients and non-human primates which are utilized through our Safety Assessment services – these large research models are sourced from Charles River audited and approved suppliers, some of which we have an ownership and/or operational involvement. \nResearch Model Services.\n RMS offers a variety of flexible solutions designed to support our clients' use of research models in basic research and screening pre-clinical drug candidates. These services address the need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the non-core aspects of their drug discovery activities. Our services include those related to the maintenance and monitoring of research models, and managing research operations for government entities, academic organizations, and commercial clients. Our expanded service offering provides greater flexibility for our clients’ research and supports increased scientific complexity. We currently have three service offerings in research models services: Insourcing Solutions, Genetically Engineered Models and Services (GEMS), and Research Animal Diagnostic Services (RADS).\nInsourcing Solutions\n. We manage the research operations of government entities, academic organizations and commercial clients (including recruitment, training, staffing and management services) both within our clients’ facilities and utilizing our Charles River Accelerator and Development Lab (CRADL™) offerings, where we provide vivarium space to our clients. Some research institutions prefer to retain certain elements of their research in-house, while outsourcing staffing and management, thus driving demand for our services. We believe that our expertise in early-stage drug research, and in particular research model care, scientific and technical support, facility operations, and discovery and development services, enhances the productivity and quality of our clients’ research programs.\nGenetically Engineered Models and Services\n. We create, breed and maintain research models required by our clients for biomedical research activities. The creation of a genetically engineered model (GEM) is a critical scientific event, but it is only one step in the discovery process, and our scientists can advise clients on how to efficiently create custom models utilizing in-licensed technologies and approaches to modify the genome. Productive utilization of GEMs requires significant additional technical expertise in order to properly support basic and early discovery research. We provide breeding expertise and colony expansion, quarantine, health and genetic testing and monitoring, germplasm cryopreservation and rederivation, including assisted reproduction and model creation. Our team of project managers is supported by a proprietary, technologically advanced Internet Colony Management (ICM™) system that allows for real-time data exchange. We provide these services to clients around the world, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, hospitals, universities, and government agencies.\nResearch Animal Diagnostic Services\n. We monitor and analyze the health profiles of our clients’ research models and research biologics by assessing infectious agents and pathology. We developed this capability internally to address the quality control of our research model business. We can serve as our clients’ sole-source testing laboratory, or as an alternative source supporting our clients’ internal laboratory capabilities. We believe we are the reference laboratory of choice for health assessment of laboratory research models and an industry leader in the field of laboratory animal diagnostics.\nCell Solutions\n. Our Cell Solutions business provides consenting human donor-derived cellular materials used in the development and production of cell therapies. The business supplies controlled, consistent, customized primary cells and blood components derived from normal and mobilized peripheral blood and bone marrow, as well as cells from disease state donors. Our Cell Solutions business supports biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and other research organizations who rely on high-quality, viable and functional human primary cells and blood components for biomedical and drug discovery research and cell therapy development, including clinical trials. \nDiscovery and Safety Assessment\nWe currently offer regulated and non-regulated DSA services to support the discovery, development, and regulatory-required safety testing of potential new drugs, including \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo \nstudies, laboratory support services, including bioanalytical and strategic non-clinical consulting and program management.\nIn 2025, we initiated the integration of our Discovery Services and Safety Assessment businesses into one overarching DSA organization. This unification focuses on a combined sales force and leadership approach, with integrated scientific expertise to facilitate a more seamless client experience and make us a stronger and even more responsive partner for our clients. \n4\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nDiscovery Services\n.\n We offer a single source of services for discovering and characterizing novel drug candidates for preclinical development by providing a full spectrum of discovery services — from identification and validation of novel targets, low molecular weight small molecule compounds, oligonucleotides, and biotherapeutics with actual or potential intellectual property value, through to delivery of preclinical drug and biotherapeutic candidates ready for safety assessment and progression toward the clinic. This includes services to streamline and enhance drug discovery programs for our clients, including expertise and capabilities in all stages of discovery and all major modalities including small molecules, biologics (antibodies), oligonucleotides, and cell and gene therapies. In the discovery phase, we leverage our capabilities in non-GLP toxicity assessment and predictive models to enable identification and mitigation of safety issues to ensure a smooth progression into regulatory safety assessment. We have in depth capabilities in formulation and pharmaceutics to provide seamless transfer of optimized drug substance from the discovery phase into pre-clinical development and safety assessment. Our Safety Assessment teams can flag unexpected issues observed in regulatory toxicology to our Discovery Services team that might be resolved by further optimization within Discovery Services, enabling clients to potentially regain momentum in pre-clinical programs after resolution of the issues. Our seamless offering portfolio, along with our broad expertise and capabilities allow us to better engage with clients at any stage of their drug discovery programs and support their complex scientific needs. We focus on major therapeutic areas, with a strategic emphasis on neuroscience, oncology, and immunology. We believe there are growing opportunities to assist our clients in a variety of drug discovery applications and platforms, from target discovery to candidate selection and across the full range of modalities. \nWe are a leader in integrated drug discovery services. Our full suite of service offerings, together with our knowledge and expertise, allows us to engage and support our clients at any stage of their discovery or early-stage development programs, including the design and implementation of their research programs, and to stay with them through the entire drug discovery process, providing a seamless end-to-end offering.

We are a global leader in both non-regulated and regulated GLP outsourced safety assessment services and provide expertise in a variety of therapeutic areas and modalities.\nToxicology.\n In addition to offering standard toxicology services, we also provide a broad range of specialty toxicology offering from inhalation and infusion to developmental and reproductive toxicology. Our services include an extensive offering of capabilities and study types designed to identify possible safety risks as well as a comprehensive offering of \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n studies in support of general toxicology (acute, sub-acute and chronic studies), genetic toxicology, safety pharmacology, off-target screening, receptor identification profiling, reproductive and developmental toxicology, juvenile toxicology, and carcinogenicity bioassays that are required for regulatory submissions supporting “first-in-human” to “first-to-the-market” strategies for potential human therapeutics. Additionally, we support safety studies in numerous specialty areas including cell and gene therapies, ecotoxicology, environmental risk, musculoskeletal toxicology, neurotoxicology, ocular toxicology, ototoxicology, and phototoxicology. We have expertise in the design and execution of development programs in support of a broad diversity of therapeutic modalities in numerous laboratory species and test systems. We also support safety studies to test industrial chemical, agrochemicals, consumer products, veterinary medicines and medical devices. For human pharmaceutical candidates, once a lead candidate is selected, toxicology studies are required to support clinical trials in humans and for regulatory approval. These toxicology studies focus on assessing the safety of the potential therapeutic to determine if administration to humans might cause any unintended harmful effects. For new chemicals, industrial chemicals, agrochemicals, veterinary medicines, consumer products and medical devices, safety studies are performed to identify potential hazards to \n5\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nhumans and the environment and are required for regulatory registration. Toxicology studies performed for any of these compounds are typically performed using \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n research models to identify any potential adverse effects that a compound has on an organism or tissue over a variety of doses and over various time periods of exposure.\nPathology Services.\n The ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic changes is critical in determining the safety and efficacy of potential new therapeutics, industrial and agricultural chemicals, veterinary medicines, and medical devices. Key “go/no-go” decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the identification, characterization and evaluation of fluid, tissue and cellular changes that our experts identify and interpret for our clients. We employ many highly trained veterinary anatomic and clinical pathologists and other scientists who use state-of-the-art techniques to identify potential test item-related changes. In addition to all standard anatomic and clinical pathology techniques, we provide specialized evaluations such as digital primary and peer review histopathology options, cytology, platelet function, assay development, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, image analysis, tissue morphometry and spatial analysis services.\nSafety Pharmacology.\n Our clients are also required to conduct an assessment of safety pharmacology. This suite of studies is used to determine any effects on the vital organ systems of the body - cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system (CNS). Along with heart rate and blood pressure measurements, the cardiovascular assessment will also assess if the test article has the potential to alter cardiac ion channel currents and prolong the cardiac QT interval of the electrocardiogram. Additionally, effects on the CNS and respiratory systems are assessed to complete the battery of studies to evaluate the vital organ systems of the body. Supplemental studies can also be performed to assess the renal, gastrointestinal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as dependency potential. We have \nin vitro\n, \nex vivo \n(use of cells, tissues or organs outside of an \nin vivo\n system) and \nin vivo\n assays and perform the screening prior to the initiation of first-in-human clinical trials. Our capabilities can also be used to investigate the mode of action behind an adverse effect found in a safety assessment study.\nBioanalysis, Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics\n. In support of non-clinical drug safety testing and new chemical development, our clients are required to demonstrate appropriate stability in the collected biological sample, pharmacokinetics of their drug or compound in circulation, the presence of metabolites and, in the case of biologics, the presence or absence of anti-drug antibodies. We have scientific expertise in the sophisticated bioanalytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for many drugs and chemicals. Once analysis is complete, our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the pharmacokinetics and/or toxicokinetics of the drug or chemical and complete an evaluation of the biologic disposition of the drug or chemical and its potential metabolites. Pharmacokinetics refers to the understanding of what the body does to a drug or compound administered at therapeutic dose levels, including the process by which the drug is absorbed, distributed in the body, metabolized and excreted. Toxicokinetics refers to the same understanding as applied at higher doses that may result in adverse effects. These studies are routinely required for the full non-clinical assessment of the disposition of the drug or chemical and the results are used in the safety evaluation of the compound. After performing sample analysis in support of non-clinical studies, we also support the clinical bioanalysis required in clinical trials for drug development. In addition, our Laboratory Sciences group is able to measure a wide range of non-clinical and clinical biomarkers related to the safety and efficacy of the drugs and/or chemicals being developed.\nOur Safety Assessment facilities comply with animal welfare and GLP regulations to the extent required by the FDA, Environmental Protection Agency, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), European Medicines Agency, European Chemicals Agency and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) as well as other international regulatory agencies. Furthermore, our non-GLP and early-stage discovery work performed at our Safety Assessment facilities, which are not subject to GLP regulations, is typically carried out under a quality management system. Our Safety Assessment facilities and Manufacturing facilities are regularly inspected by regulatory compliance monitoring authorities, our clients’ quality assurance departments and our own internal quality audit program.\nManufacturing Solutions\nOur Manufacturing Solutions segment is comprised of two businesses: Microbial Solutions and Biologics Solutions.\nMicrobial Solutions\n. Our Microbial Solutions business operates as a rapid, efficient testing platform for microbial detection and identification of sterile and non-sterile applications. Microbial Solutions is a premier global provider of \nin vitro\n methods for conventional and rapid quality control testing, including FDA-mandated lot release testing for sterile biopharmaceutical products. The products and services are provided by our Endosafe®, Celsis® and Accugenix® businesses, which produce, globally distribute and service a comprehensive portfolio of endotoxin testing, microbial detection and identification kits, reagents, instruments, software, accessories, and laboratory services to a broad range of companies manufacturing and releasing products from the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical devices and consumer products companies. Our Endosafe® business provides lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs for endotoxin contamination. Our Celsis® business provides rapid microbial detection systems for lot release testing as well as raw materials and in-process for quality control testing in the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer products industries.

We expect our comprehensive portfolio of offerings and global network of laboratories to drive increased adoption of our quality control testing solutions across both sterile and non-sterile applications.\nEndosafe\n®\n. We are a market leader in endotoxin testing products and services, which are used for FDA-required quality control testing of injectable drugs and medical devices, their components, and the processes by which they are manufactured. Endotoxin testing is an \nin vitro\n process that uses a processed extract from horseshoe crabs, known as limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL). The LAL test is the first and most successful FDA-validated alternative to an \nin vivo\n test to date. Generally, the extraction of the raw materials for LAL does not harm the crabs, which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean environment. We have worked closely with regulatory agencies in states where we collect to limit our impact on the horseshoe crab population and their surrounding environment.\nOne of the primary growth drivers in our Microbial Solutions business is our FDA-approved line of next-generation endotoxin testing products. This line is based on the Endosafe Portable Testing System (Endosafe® -PTS™) technology, which allows rapid endotoxin testing in the central laboratory or manufacturing environment. In recent years, we expanded the PTS product portfolio to include a multiple sample testing system known as the Endosafe®-MCS™ (multi-cartridge system) and the first fully automated robotic system developed specifically for high-volume endotoxin testing, Endosafe®-Nexus, to satisfy the demand of our clients who require higher sample throughput. We have seen expanded use of this rapid endotoxin testing technology as clients transition from traditional methods to our rapid cartridge technology and are seeking to meet data integrity requirements with our automated systems and software solutions. In 2023, we launched Endosafe® Trillium®, our animal-free recombinant test for endotoxin detection. Endosafe® Trillium® utilizes three biological proteins, which we believe provides superior accuracy and testing outcomes to competitors’ single-protein recombinant alternatives, as well as equivalence to LAL-based testing method. Endosafe® Trillium® represents a next-generation solution to our industry-leading Endosafe® bacterial endotoxin detection portfolio.\nCelsis\n®\n. The Celsis® reagents and instrument systems are used for in-process and product-release testing to help ensure the safe and efficient manufacture of pharmaceutical and consumer products. Celsis® products utilize adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence technology for the rapid detection of microbial contamination delivering definitive results for some applications as fast as 24 hours. The product range includes reagent kits, instruments, software and services. The Celsis Advance II™, Celsis Accel™, and Celsis Adapt™ instruments and software automate the process for rapid microbial detection. We maintain a suite of products focused on sterility testing. Sterility testing is required prior to the release of sterile injectable products. The legacy method required a 14-day sample incubation period and was subjective. Using the Celsis® protocol and instrumentation, clients can detect contamination within 6 days and make definitive product release decisions. We also offer Celsis Complete™ and Celsis Advantage™ services. The Celsis Complete™ services supply both the documentation and testing required as part of a client sterility technology method validation process. This assists clients to complete their validation process very quickly without utilizing their own personnel resources. The Celsis Advantage product supplies the required documentation needed for the clients to conduct their own internal validation.

Our large, global portfolio of products, services and solutions focuses on drug discovery and early-stage development. We provide research models and associated services, discovery research studies and services and comprehensive safety assessment studies in both regulated and non-regulated environments. As such, we can collaborate with clients from target discovery through development candidate selection. When critical decisions are made regarding which therapeutics will progress from discovery to development, we continue to work alongside our clients as the drug candidates move downstream. Our recognized expertise in early-stage drug research and pharmacology provides us with a competitive advantage and enables our clients to make critical drug development decisions more quickly. We understand our clients’ therapies and the challenges they face during the discovery and development process, including mechanism of action, efficacy, drug metabolism, safety assessment and toxicological testing, which are all critical for making “go/no-go” decisions.\nComprehensive Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Portfolio. \nWe also offer a portfolio of products, services and solutions that supports the process development, scale up, quality control and production efforts of the biopharmaceutical industry. We provide products and services that support the development and release of clinical stage and commercialized biologics products, including CDMO services to manufacture advanced therapeutics for our clients. In particular, we are an industry leader in the areas of microbial detection and microbial identification to support process development and ongoing commercial production. Our portfolio spans a broad range of traditional and rapid methods, which provide the highest testing quality, enhanced productivity and reduced cycle time. \nDeep Scientific Expertis\ne. We provide a breadth and depth of scientific expertise across a broad range of therapeutic areas which may be too costly for our clients to build and/or maintain in-house. We provide essential capabilities, including medicinal chemistry, \nin vitro\n biology, \nin vivo\n pharmacology, pathology, advanced modalities manufacturing, analytical testing for early and late stage products, immunology, biomarker assessment, biologics process development testing, microbial detection and identification and other specialty service areas that have high infrastructure costs or are cost-prohibitive for clients to maintain independently. We continue to look for opportunities to expand our portfolio in key therapeutic and pharmacology areas to align with our clients’ internal drug discovery and development areas of focus. We also continue to enhance our small molecule, biologics, and advanced modalities portfolios in areas of greatest industry need, where outsourcing provides major benefits for our clients and where we could provide significant benefits given our unique early-stage development portfolio and global footprint.\n8\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nCommitment to Animal Welfare\n. We are committed to being the worldwide leader in the humane care of research animals and implementation of the “3Rs” initiative (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement). As researchers, we are responsible to our clients, our animals and the public for the health and well-being of the animals in our care. We work closely with the scientific community to understand how living conditions, handling procedures and reduction of stress play an important role in the quality and efficiency of research. We are committed to working with the industry to support development and to provide the best translational models to supplement or replace traditional live animal models. These include \nin vitro \nmodels, \nin silico\n predictive tools, and virtual control groups. \nSuperior Quality and Client Support\n. We maintain scientific rigor and high-quality standards through management of key performance indicators and an intense focus on biosecurity and quality. These standards help to reduce research risk and allow clients to access our global portfolio of products and services with the confidence that they will obtain consistent results no matter where they choose to obtain their products or conduct their research. \nFlexible and Customized Environment to Provide the Right Solutions\n. Each of our clients is different, with unique needs and specific requirements. We understand the importance of flexibility, and leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated, non-clinical portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client. By utilizing our streamlined and efficient facilities, we help clients create a flexible and integrated infrastructure in order to improve their workload and staffing requirements. This allows our clients to optimize internal capacity and/or staff while ensuring the conduct of effective quality research for their projects. We provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a full-service integrated partner over a longer period of time.\nLarge, Global Partner\n. We believe there is an important advantage in being a full service, high-quality provider of research models and associated services, discovery and non-clinical\n in vivo\n and \nin vitro\n services and manufacturing solutions on a global scale. Many of our clients, especially large biopharmaceutical companies, have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work. They frequently choose to partner with large companies similar to Charles River, that can offer clients support across the non-clinical drug research process as a result of broader portfolios and experience in project management. This includes extensive scientific, technical and therapeutic area expertise, timely access to data, documentation and data visualization through secure portals, provision of data in sponsor-specific formats for data warehousing needs, accelerated reporting, reduced standard reporting timelines and industry-leading Standard Exchange of Non-Clinical Data (SEND) capabilities, a global footprint, streamlined and simplified processes and communications, including professional project and relationship management. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider, thereby enabling us to build broader and deeper long-term strategic relationships with our clients.\nDigital Enhancements. \nAs the healthcare industry evolves, technology is playing an essential role. This technological revolution is not only helping streamline processes and operations, but the effects of this digitization directly impact patients. We are committed in our efforts to reduce the timeline to develop, safe and innovative new treatments for patients who desperately need them. To progress this forward, we strive to understand the true challenges that can slow drug research and development and re-imagine the way we work and collaborate to create digitally native solutions that improve efficiency, accelerate processes and enable automated, data driven outcomes. Our commitment to understanding the problem before finding a solution has enabled us to keep clients—and ultimately patients—at the center of the way we look at problems. By using client-centric design thinking, agile-based test and learn processes in short iterative cycles, and automating existing processes, we optimize client experiences and bring holistic solutions to pressing concerns. \nOur clients’ R&D needs continue to evolve. These clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process. The result is a focus on discovery services, including \nin vitro \nmodels and\n in vivo\n pharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and non-GLP DMPK (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics) studies. Second, these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery and safety assessment services to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug selection processes.\nWe believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future. We remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to partnering with us as a means of meeting their discovery and non-clinical support needs. We believe that the successful development of new therapies and outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be positive drivers of demand for our products and services.\nGlobal biopharmaceutical companies are continuing to make the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery, development and manufacturing processes. The success of our business model is underscored by the fact that we have entered into strategic commercial relationships with leading global biopharmaceutical companies and expanded existing preferred provider agreements with other leading global biopharmaceutical companies. We also continue to broaden and extend our relationships with other research institutions across the portfolio. \n9\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nWe believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution. They will continue to reassess their core differentiators from R&D to commercialization, and which aspects of their drug discovery, development and manufacturing processes they will choose to outsource. We expect they will also continue to be conservative in building infrastructure and expertise. This should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as larger biopharmaceutical clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure. By partnering with Charles River, we believe our clients can take advantage of efficiencies in their early-stage research activities that can result in months saved in getting a drug to market. In the aggregate, we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical R&D business model along with our focus on data and digitalization will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients, and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research, non-clinical development and manufacturing efficiency and cost effectiveness.\nWe believe it is critical to participate in the strategic commercial partnering process because these relationships are likely to extend for multiple years and drive pull-through across our portfolio. Furthermore, both the client and Charles River invest heavily in the initial phases of the relationship to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes. Given this investment, clients are less likely to change partners at the conclusion of the initial relationship. \nThe evolving biopharmaceutical R&D business model, coupled with solid long-term biopharmaceutical industry fundamentals and a historically sustained funding environment, have also led to the continued creation of new biotechnology companies focused on developing innovative new therapies. The biopharmaceutical industry continues to evolve and become more sophisticated, with research yielding new types of treatments with increasing complexity, and more targeted and individualized therapies. While the recent biopharmaceutical demand environment has been less robust, we believe that our portfolio provides flexible solutions and scientific expertise that meet the customized needs for virtual and small biotechnology companies, which have limited or no infrastructure. These clients also value our ability to provide a broad range of services where we work hand in hand with our clients to design, plan and manage integrated projects and programs. This includes classically outsourced services, “insourced” services and hybrid offerings blending resources from both our clients and our staff.\nWe are taking decisive action to manage the Company through the current demand environment, including appropriately right-sizing our infrastructure, optimizing operations, and driving efficiency with a goal to protect operating margin. We are committed to initiatives to generate more revenue, contain costs, and protect shareholder value through enhanced commercial initiatives, restructuring and efficiency actions to drive cost savings, as well as a balanced approach to capital deployment, including:\n•\nRestructuring initiatives to manage costs and generate efficiency by reducing staffing levels to align with the level of demand, as well as evaluating our global footprint to optimize, consolidate, and simplify operations. We are also engaging in global footprint optimization efforts to maximize capacity and enhance our capabilities. We have taken a client-centric approach to these actions with a goal of serving our clients more efficiently and seamlessly in order to capture synergies and savings that extend beyond the facility costs. These footprint optimization efforts are intended to enhance the efficiency and economies of scale in our global infrastructure, leading to a more disciplined operating model. In addition, Charles River’s culture of continuous improvement strives to implement initiatives to drive greater operating efficiencies. In the current demand environment, we are focused on achieving this goal through streamlining global business services, driving enhanced procurement savings, and leveraging our digital platform. \n•\nFocusing on commercial enhancements to promote a client-centric focus and gain additional market share. Our goal is to enhance the client experience and reinforce our role as a flexible and responsive partner to our clients, including through leveraging technology such as our Apollo™ cloud-based platform to provide real-time access to scientific data and self-service tools for clients.\n•\nContinuing to evaluate additional strategies to enhance the business. We are working on initiatives to further transform how we operate, including harmonization and centralization of processes, tools and tasks, continuing to better leverage technology, adoption of a global businesses service model to streamline our operations, as well as other projects such as generating greater procurement savings.\nOur strategic imperatives and operational goals are centered around our intense focus on initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth, enhance our operating efficiency and better position ourselves to function successfully in the current and future business environment, which we believe will collectively enable us to maximize value for our shareholders. \n10\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nOver the past decade, we have expanded our capabilities by adding high-science services with the goal to deliver fast and high quality end-to-end integrated, non-clinical solution to accelerate drug development.\n \nWe intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services that we provide across the drug discovery and non-clinical development continuum primarily through internal development, and also, through focused acquisitions and our strategic partnerships strategy, all of which are intended to enable us with the flexibility to adapt and innovate to meet our client’s changing needs. Acquisitions, such as our acquisitions of Explora BioLabs in fiscal 2022, SAMDI in 2023, and Noveprim in 2023, have been (and we expect will be in the future) an integral part of our growth strategy, both to expand our portfolio and broaden our geographic footprint. We are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit. We aim to consistently deliver shareholder value, including the achievement of a hurdle rate for return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital.\nMergers and acquisitions remain one of our top, long-term priorities for disciplined capital deployment and enhancing growth strategy with focus on enhancing the breadth of our scientific capabilities principally within our core competencies, expanding our global scale, and maintaining our leadership position in advanced and emerging therapies. Our long-term strategy also includes growth through establishing relationships and exploring other opportunities and areas that have the potential to strengthen our broad-based portfolio of products and services. \nWe also partner with a diverse set of leading venture capital firms around the world primarily investing in life sciences, health care and therapeutics with an emphasis on early-stage companies. Through these partnerships and close relationships, we gain insight into their company and asset portfolios and are thus able to promote our services for each of our businesses. We also view these partnerships as an investment in new and emerging sciences and technologies as they allow us to gain insights to cutting-edge capabilities. Thus, we have the opportunity to establish ourselves as a provider of choice for a unique client group that has emerged as biopharmaceutical companies rationalize and prioritize their development pipelines.\nWe routinely evaluate strategic fit and fundamental performance of our businesses. As part of this ongoing assessment, we may determine certain capital could be better deployed in other long-term growth opportunities. Most recently, we divested our Avian Vaccine Services business in 2022, and a Safety Assessment site in 2024, as we determined these businesses/sites were no longer a strategic fit.\nClients\nOur clients consist primarily of major biopharmaceutical companies; many small, emerging, and established biotechnology, agricultural and industrial chemical, life science, veterinary medicine, medical device, diagnostic and consumer product companies; contract research and contract manufacturing organizations; and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations. We have stable, long-term relationships with many of our clients. During 2024, no single client accounted for more than 4% of our total revenue and no single client accounted for more than 8% of the revenue of any of our three business segments.\nWe continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients, and with many of our larger mid-tier clients. These relationships take different forms, from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships. The structure of these relationships incentivizes clients to purchase more products and services across our non-clinical portfolio. Because of the strength of these relationships, we have better insight into our clients’ planning processes and, therefore, better visibility than in the past. For information regarding revenue attributable to each of our business segments for the last three fiscal years, please see Note 4. Segment and Geographic Information, included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. For information regarding revenue and long-lived assets attributable to operations in the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years, please review Note 4. Segment and Geographic Information, included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nSales, Marketing and Customer Support\nOur marketing efforts are focused on stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire services portfolio. We believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects of early-stage drug research are increasingly attractive to our clients, and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible, customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients’ global and site-specific needs.\nOur go-to-market approach employs a number of sales and marketing strategies, including dedicated sales teams for each of our major lines of business and global and key account managers who represent the entire portfolio. We also maintain several sales specialists that either have specific technical expertise (often degreed scientists) or cover unique markets.\nIn addition to our field sales teams and related specialists, we also have a team of alliance managers who are organized by key client within our market segments (global biopharmaceutical, small and mid-sized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and academic and government institutions). This enhances our ability to meet client needs by offering customized, \n11\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\ntailored solutions across our entire portfolio. In addition, our clients benefit by additional support from a combination of technical specialists with specific scientific and therapeutic area expertise. We also apply the use of dedicated sales specialists for certain technical product lines, such as in our Manufacturing businesses.\nWe sell our products and services principally through our direct sales and business development teams who work in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition to interactions with our direct sales force, our primary promotional activities include presenting scientific symposia to targeted audiences, publishing scientific papers, technical support pieces and white papers, and newsletters, hosting webinars and virtual seminars and making presentations at, and participating in, scientific conferences and trade shows in North America, Europe and Asia. We supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with digital marketing, advertising and website content. In certain areas, our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents.\nOur internal strategic marketing and marketing operations teams support the field sales and business development teams while developing and implementing programs to build awareness about products and services and create opportunities for interaction with our clients in the biomedical research industry. We maintain client engagement, lead development support, digital experience, eCommerce, and event management departments, which address both our clients’ routine and more specialized needs and purposely serve as a scientific support and information resource for them. We frequently assist our clients in solving problems related to resourcing products and services, research support, non-clinical study design, regulatory consulting, protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our clients.\nCompetition\nOur goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate. We compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise in early-stage drug research, quality, reputation, flexibility, responsiveness, pricing, innovation and global capabilities. We are able to offer a unique portfolio of early-stage products and services to support drug discovery and development.\nWe encounter a broad range of competitors of different sizes and capabilities in each of our three businesses segments. We also face competition from the internal discovery and development resources of our clients.\n•\nFor RMS, we have four main competitors of which one is a government funded, not-for-profit entity; one is a public company in the U.S.; one is privately held in Europe; and one is privately held in the U.S. \n•\nFor DSA, both our discovery services and safety assessment services have numerous competitors. Our discovery services offerings have hundreds of competitors, but two main competitors: one is a public company in China and one is a public company in Europe. Our safety assessment offerings have dozens of competitors of varying size, but one main competitor that is a division of a large public company in the U.S. Our DSA segment also competes with in-house departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and teaching hospitals.\n•\nFor Manufacturing, each of our underlying businesses has several competitors. Microbial Solutions has four main competitors, of which three are public companies in Europe and one is part of a public company in Japan. In addition to many smaller competitors, Biologics Solutions has five main competitors, of which three are public companies in Europe, one is a public company in the U.S., and one is a public company in China. \nIndustry Support and Animal Welfare\nOne of our core values is a commitment to animal welfare. Research animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery and development of life-saving drugs. We work with our scientific community peers to understand how living conditions, handling procedures, and experimental procedures contribute to animal stress and play a role in the quality of research outcomes. As researchers, we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well-being of the animals in our care, and prioritize the humane treatment of these critically important research models. \nWe have been at the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business. We created our own Humane Care Imperative (HCI), which is overseen by our Global Animal Welfare and Training corporate group. The goal of HCI is to ensure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of research animals and implementation of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement). As part of the HCI, we also have quarterly recognition and celebration of employees that go above and beyond to promote animal welfare and safety, In 2024, we published on our website an extensive and comprehensive Corporate Citizenship Report, which includes information on our Global Animal Welfare and Training, Responsible Animal Use and New Alternative Methodologies (NAMs) work, including investments in NAMs through our recently launched Alternative Methods Advancement Project (AMAP) initiative that is dedicated to investing in and developing alternatives to reduce animal testing.\n12\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nWe are firmly committed to the 3Rs and to reducing the number of animals that we work with by emphasizing health, research animal behavioral management programs and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability. Whenever possible, we use low stress handling of our animals, technological advances such as \nin vitro \ndiagnostic tests for health surveillance in laboratory rodents, microsampling and various \nin vitro\n assays. We support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare and the 3Rs, as well as the interests of the biomedical research community. We also partner with clients to develop study designs to right-size the number of animals needed and suggest pilot studies where appropriate. We maintain a quarterly award program that recognizes our employees’ efforts to continually implement the 3Rs at our sites globally.\nWe provide scholarships for training in laboratory animal science, financial support to non-profit organizations that promote and educate the public about animal welfare, the 3Rs, and the benefits of animal research, and awards to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal science field and the supporters of 3Rs.\nIn 2023, our Board of Directors established a Responsible Animal Use Committee to assist the Company in improving our impact on responsible animal utilization, including evaluating and advising scientific and technological opportunities which may appropriately reduce the impact of animals in the Company’s operations. Additionally, in March 2024 we published our first annual report to shareholders on the measures the Company takes to reinforce confidence that the NHPs we import are sourced in accordance with applicable laws. \nHuman Capital Resources \nEmployees\nAs of December 28, 2024, we had approximately 20,100 employees (including approximately 2,550 science professionals with advanced degrees, including Ph.D.s, D.V.M.s and M.D.s). Approximately 18,600 of our employees are considered full-time employees, while approximately 1,400 are considered part-time employees. Our workforce was distributed geographically approximately as follows: 61% in North America, 32% in Europe, 5% in Asia, and 2% in other regions.\nPart of the decisive action we have and continue to implement to manage the Company through the current demand environment includes restructuring initiatives to manage costs and generate efficiency by reducing staffing levels to align with the pace of demand. We have reduced our total headcount by approximately 8% since the end of 2023. It is imperative in this environment to keep our staff well utilized in order to protect operating income margin, which is our goal.\nOur employees are not unionized in the U.S. Employees at some of our European facilities are represented by works councils, employee representative groups and/or unions, which is consistent with local customs for our industry. We collaborate with the works councils and believe we have good relationships with our employees.\nValues\nAt Charles River, our values of Care, Lead, Own, and Collaborate guide our decisions and actions; they are standards we hold ourselves to each and every day and are critical to success in fulfilling our goals. In addition, our Charles River DNA are the behaviors based on these values that we use to make decisions, grow our future leaders, and pave the way for years ahead.\nTalent Management, Belonging, and Engagement\nSustaining our company culture is a vital part of our strategy. Our culture is built on trust, belonging, accountability, respect, well-being, and safety. Our objective is to enable an environment where every colleague can connect with their work in a way that supports each other, our clients, and our communities. We strive to maintain an environment wherein every person has the ability to deliver on business commitments, while having purpose, being energized, continuously learning, and delivering quality outcomes that make a difference. As a global organization, our growth and development depend on hiring, engaging, and retaining a skilled and global workforce in a highly competitive marketplace. In fiscal 2024, we hired over 2,200 people and our voluntary turnover for all employees was approximately 11.1%.\nWe pride ourselves on supporting our people both professionally and personally throughout their employee experience with us. In order to attract the best candidate for each position, we prioritize widescale recruitment efforts to attract a larger pool of applicants from a variety of backgrounds. Our hiring process is designed to ensure fair and objective decisions lead to the most qualified candidate being hired. We strive to make our hiring practices accessible, including offering reasonable accommodations as appropriate. \nBeginning with our onboarding program, our talent management approach is structured to be highly collaborative, encourage ownership, and provide the opportunity to contribute and develop through regular performance conversations, annual goal setting, and ongoing feedback. Furthermore, we have created a global learning strategy that includes technical training, mentoring and coaching approaches, tuition reimbursement, sabbaticals, leadership development programs, and on-the-job training to ensure access to skill building and career advancement for all. We conduct regular talent reviews to identify and develop global leadership and key talent pipelines to deliver on short-term and long-term business strategy. \n13\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nWe are also committed to cultivating a welcoming environment where every employee can succeed and thrive. We believe in treating our employees and prospective talent with fairness, dignity, decency, and respect. We recognize that our differences contribute to a more innovative workforce and are a strength for our business. It is critical that our people feel valued, supported, and that we provide opportunities for all. \nOur engagement surveys are in the form of frequent, shorter “Pulse” surveys. These Pulse surveys were issued twice during 2024 and serve as a foundation for more meaningful conversations and actions between our people and people leaders to continue making Charles River a best place to work, learn, and grow.\nIn addition to growth and learning opportunities, we strive to attract, motivate, and retain top talent by providing competitive compensation programs while rewarding outcomes and behaviors that align with our performance, culture, and values. We perform pay equity audits in countries where they are legally required. Our global job architecture generally allows for aligning pay by job role with market rates and serves as a career path tool to support advancement. Additionally, we assess pay on a global scale to ensure we continue to be competitive in the marketplace. \nHealth and Safety\nWe are committed to creating a healthy and safe workplace for our employees and visitors to our facilities. This commitment is outlined in our Global Policy on Safety & Sustainability where we define the company’s approach to embedding safety and sustainably into our company’s purpose. Our EHS&S Global Operating Framework (GOF) is the foundation of our management system approach to incorporating health and safety into our business practices. These programs are supported by site health and safety leaders who engage employees and management to reinforce the importance of ownership of the programs and integration of these practices into our work each day. In 2022 we launched a Safety-First Culture initiative to reinforce that every person working for and on behalf of Charles River recognizes the importance of working safely as their first directive. The underpinning of this initiative was delivering safety culture training to all levels of leadership across the organization. As of 2024, we have conducted safety culture training and workshops to the executive leadership team, site general managers and all people leaders. In 2023 we initiated a formal Environment, Health, Safety and Sustainability Assessment program conducting 17 site assessments in the inaugural year of the program. In 2024 we have continued our safety-first culture journey by requiring all operational people leaders to include a health and safety goal as part of their annual performance, conducted 23 additional site program assessments and provided quarterly updates to business leadership on injury data analysis, trends to track performance against goals, and opportunities to invest in impactful safety improvements.\nBacklog\nOur backlog for our RMS, DSA and Manufacturing reportable segments was approximately $685 million, $2.0 billion and $103 million, respectively, as of December 28, 2024, as compared to $489 million, $2.5 billion and $143 million, respectively, as of December 30, 2023. Related services are performed over varying durations, from short to extended periods of time, which may be as long as several years. We maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started, but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. We only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a client’s intention to proceed. Canceled studies or projects are removed from backlog.\nWe believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons. First, studies vary in duration (i.e., some studies or projects that are included in December 28, 2024 backlog may be completed in 2025, while others may be completed in later years). Second, the scope of studies or projects may change, which may either increase or decrease their value. Third, studies or projects included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments. Fourth, studies or projects may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons, including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements, or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary. Delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue, modify or cancel the study has been made. We may not be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year. Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosed herein for our assessment of certain relevant risk factors.\nRegulatory Matters\nAs our business operates in many distinct regional environments and in a variety of locations worldwide, we are subject to numerous, and sometimes overlapping, regulatory requirements.\nThe Animal Welfare Act (AWA) governs the care and use of animals used for research in the U.S. other than laboratory rats, mice and fish bred for use in research. As a result, most of our U.S. small animal research model operations are not subject to regulation under the AWA. For regulated species, the AWA requires producers and those working with regulated species to provide veterinary care and to follow specific husbandry practices such as cage size, shipping conditions, sanitation and \n14\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nenvironmental enrichment to ensure the welfare of these animals. Separately, facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) must also adhere to the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and follow “The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” approved by the Board of the National Research Council.\nWe comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the USDA and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and similar applicable agencies in other global regions such as Canada, Europe and China for the care, handling and oversight of regulated species. Our DSA and RMS facilities that work with or produce research animals in North America and Europe are accredited, with the exception of new and recently acquired facilities that are in the process of planning for accreditation, by AAALAC International, a private, nonprofit, independent accrediting organization that promotes the humane care and treatment of animals in science and education through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs.\nOur import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to applicable international agreements and conventions, as well as a variety of national, regional and local laws and regulations, which establish the standards for the humane treatment, care, handling and transport of animals by dealers and research facilities. We only use accredited and experienced transporters for importing and exporting animals who are specialists in their field. We comply with global requirements which are evaluated by import and export authorities at each point of exit and entry. Imported animals are quarantined in our quarantine facilities as required by government agencies and tested to ensure they meet both the government mandates and our own specifications for pathogens and health of the animals.\nWe conduct non-clinical safety assessment studies to support the submissions for approval or licensing of our clients’ products throughout the world. Many of these studies must comply with national statutory or regulatory requirements for GLP. GLP regulations describe a quality system for the scientific, operational and quality process and the conditions under which non-clinical studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived. GLP compliance is required by such regulatory agencies as the FDA, European Medicines Agency, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom (U.K.), Health Products Regulatory Authority in Ireland, Health Canada and other similar monitoring authorities in the countries where we operate. GLP requirements are significantly harmonized throughout the world and our laboratories are capable of conducting studies in compliance with all applicable requirements.\nRegulatory monitoring authorities such as the FDA, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and OECD countries have indicated an increased emphasis on the management of electronic records and signatures generated by computerized systems to ensure data integrity. We have established corporate data integrity governance to manage regulatory requirements and client expectations regarding data quality within our regulated businesses. Although each business has a different impact on patient safety, all are expected to generate and preserve data with integrity. We recognize the importance of generating quality, reliable, sustainable data and have instituted several processes and established a global governance team with oversight responsibilities for our Data Integrity Compliance Plans to ensure we are consistent in our approach. To ensure that we have proper regulatory oversight over our electronic records, a dedicated quality function reviews our computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements are met for compliance.\nAt a global level, retention of data and controls for electronic systems, proprietary data and quality standards are covered by global policies. We also have controls in place such as quality manuals, policies and procedures, work instructions, document control processes, training, quality assurance and quality control processes and personnel, validated computerized systems and archiving requirements. Within businesses, procedures govern performance of activities to ensure data integrity throughout its life cycle.\nOur Manufacturing businesses produce FDA regulated endotoxin test kits at an FDA registered facility. We also manufacture sterility and microbial limits test kits used in FDA Regulated pharmaceutical applications, reagents, cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production, clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products as well as an animal-free recombinant cascade reagent (rCR), Endosafe® Trillium®, which is an alternative to the natural LAL product. Additionally, several of our laboratories conduct biosafety and analytical testing such as identity, stability, sterility and potency and viral clearance testing in support of our clients’ manufacturing programs and to fulfill their validation requirements, as applicable. \nOur comprehensive cell and gene therapy manufacturing services include Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) production of cells from pre-clinical to commercial applications from a variety of starting materials. Many of these activities are subject to regulation and consequently require these businesses to be inspected by the FDA and other national and applicable state regulatory agencies under their respective cGMP regulations. These regulations require that we manufacture products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cGMP compliance, and maintain records of our manufacturing, testing and control activities. In addition, the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses and registrations for the manufacture, distribution and/or marketing of particular products globally.\n15\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nOur Cell Solutions sites provide the starting material (\ne.g.,\n leukopak) to customers that are typically in cell and gene therapy companies. Leukopaks are collected from eligible donors in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Donors consent using informed consent forms approved by an external an Institutional Review Board (IRB). Collections are performed under the supervision of licensed clinical staff and collections are managed in accordance with IRB-approved study protocols.\nAll of our sites are subject to registration, licensing and regulation, as appropriate under international treaties and conventions, including national, regional and local laws relating to:\n•\nthe surface and air transportation of chemicals, biological reagents and laboratory specimens;\n•\nthe handling, use, storage and disposal of chemicals (including narcotics and psychotropic drugs), biological reagents, laboratory specimens, hazardous waste and radioactive materials;\n•\nthe procurement, handling, use, storage and disposal of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products for research purposes;\n•\nthe safety and health of employees and visitors to our facilities; and\n•\nprotection of the environment and general public.\nOur global regulatory compliance programs are managed by global quality systems, such as vendor supplier programs, enterprise quality management systems and global computer system validation. Within each regulated business, we have established Quality Assurance Units (QAUs) responsible for risk based internal audit programs to manage regulatory requirements and client expectations. The QAUs operate independently from those individuals that direct and conduct studies, manufacturing or analytical testing. Our Data Integrity Compliance Program ensures that senior management and the QAU’s have proper oversight of our electronic records, inclusive of quality function reviews of our computerized system practices to ensure that appropriate record controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance.\nWhile we expect that capital expenditures will be necessary to ensure that our existing sites remains in compliance with all applicable regulations, at this point we do not expect these expenditures to materially differ than our historical experience.\nIntellectual Property\nWe develop and implement scientifically-driven products and procedures, including computer software, to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our offerings. Intellectual property rights, in the form of know-how, trade secrets, patents, trademarks, copyrights, and others are important to us and are valuable to our ability to provide significant benefits to our clients. Steps are taken to protect our intellectual property rights and include the execution of confidentiality agreements and securing registrations in relevant jurisdictions. In addition, we license technology from other companies when it enhances our product and services businesses. Licensing has recently become a larger company-wide initiative, particularly as we increase our focus on innovative technologies that further diversify and enhance our portfolio. \nCorporate Governance\nWe are committed to operating our business with integrity and accountability. We strive to meet or exceed all of the corporate governance standards established by the NYSE, the SEC and the U.S. Federal government as implemented by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and other applicable laws, rules and regulations.

  "item7": "Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 and a comparison of our results for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain percentage changes may not recalculate due to rounding.\nOverview\nWe are a leading, full service, non-clinical global drug development partner. For over 75 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in the research and development of new drugs, devices, and therapies. Over this time, we have built upon our original core competency of laboratory animal medicine and science (research model technologies) to develop a diverse portfolio of discovery and safety assessment services, both Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and non-GLP, that supports our clients from target identification through non-clinical development. We also provide a suite of products and services to support our clients’ manufacturing activities. Utilizing our broad portfolio of products and services enables our clients to create a more efficient and flexible drug development model, which reduces their costs, enhances their productivity and effectiveness, and increases speed to market.\nOur client base includes major global pharmaceutical companies, many biotechnology companies; agricultural and industrial chemical, life science, veterinary medicine, medical device, diagnostic and consumer product companies; contract research and contract manufacturing organizations; and other commercial entities, as well as leading hospitals, academic institutions, and government agencies around the world. We currently operate in over 130 sites and in over 20 countries worldwide, which numbers exclude certain Insourcing Solutions (IS) sites.\nSegment Reporting\nOur three reportable segments are Research Models and Services (RMS), Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA), and Manufacturing Solutions (Manufacturing). \nOur RMS reportable segment includes the products and services offered within Research Models, Research Model Services, and Cell Solutions. Research Models includes the commercial production and sale of small research models, as well as the supply of large research models. Research Model Services includes: Insourcing Solutions (IS), which provides colony management of our clients’ research operations (including recruitment, training, staffing, and management services) within our clients’ facilities as well as our own vivarium space, utilizing our Charles River Accelerator and Development Lab (CRADL™) offerings, Genetically Engineered Models and Services (GEMS), which performs contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered models; and Research Animal Diagnostic Services (RADS), which provides health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models; and Cell Solutions provides controlled, consistent, customized primary cells and blood components derived from normal and mobilized peripheral blood and bone marrow as well as cells from disease state donors.\nOur DSA segment is comprised of Discovery Services and Safety Assessment services. We provide regulated and non-regulated DSA services to support the discovery, development, and regulatory-required safety testing of potential new drugs, including \nin vitro\n (non-animal) and \nin vivo\n (in research models) studies, laboratory support services, including bioanalytical and strategic non-clinical consulting and program management to support product development.\nOur Manufacturing reportable segment includes Microbial Solutions, which provides \nin vitro\n lot-release testing products, microbial detection products, and species identification services and Biologics Solutions (Biologics), which performs specialized testing of biologics (Biologics Testing Solutions) as well as contract development and manufacturing products and services (CDMO). In December of 2022, we sold the Avian Vaccine Services (Avian) business, reported in the Manufacturing segment, which supplied specific-pathogen-free chicken eggs and chickens.\n41\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nFiscal Quarters\nOur fiscal year is typically based on 52-weeks, with each quarter composed of 13 weeks ending on the last Saturday on, or closest to, March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. A 53rd week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year is occasionally necessary to align with a December 31 calendar year-end, which occurred in fiscal year 2022.\nBusiness Trends\nIn fiscal year 2024, biopharmaceutical clients intensified their actions around restructuring initiatives and reprioritized their drug development programs, leading to constrained budgetary spending.\n \nThe uncertainty from a combination of a macroeconomic slowdown, pending patent expirations, and the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) on drug pricing had led to significant cost-cutting measures by our large biopharmaceutical clients, including significant restructuring initiatives aimed at improving efficiency and reprioritization of spending shifting to late-stage clinical pipelines.\n \nIn addition, while biotechnology companies benefited from a more favorable funding environment in fiscal year 2024, recovery for this client base has occurred at a more gradual pace than anticipated due in part to uncertainty around future funding levels and the broader interest rate environment.\nDespite the current, challenging market environment, many of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients continued to benefit from the long-term value of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and to access capabilities that they do not maintain internally. Many of our large biopharmaceutical clients have continued to rely on relationships with outsourced partners like Charles River to enhance their drug discovery and early-stage development efforts, and biotechnology companies to assist them in bringing new drugs to market. However, because of their more cautious view with regard to early-stage R&D spending, revenue due to both large biopharmaceutical clients and small and mid-sized biotechnology client declined in fiscal year 2024. However, our ability to continue to deliver our leading suite of research, non-clinical development, and clinical bioanalytical solutions has endeavored our clients to continue to choose to partner with us for our flexible and efficient outsourcing solutions, broad scientific capabilities, and global scale.\nWithin the DSA segment, these demand trends led to lower study volumes in both Safety Assessment and Discovery businesses, principally driven by softer demand from both large biopharmaceutical clients and small and mid-sized biotechnology clients.\n \nDemand trends for large biopharmaceutical clients stabilized at a lower level during the second half of 2024; however, many of these clients are still in a period of tighter budgetary spending, continuing to reprioritize pipelines or eliminate some programs, which influences our cautious outlook for the near-term biopharmaceutical demand environment. In addition, while biotechnology companies benefited from a more favorable funding environment and a slight improvement in demand trends during fiscal year 2024, recovery for this client base occurred at a more gradual pace than anticipated. DSA backlog decreased to $2.0 billion as of December 28, 2024 from $2.5 billion as of December 30, 2023. To enhance operational efficiency within the segment, the global Discovery and Safety Assessment businesses will implement a “One DSA” integrated operating structure. This unification will focus on a combined salesforce and leadership approach, with integrated scientific programming in order to facilitate a more seamless client experience and enhance the Company’s client relationships.\nRevenue for RMS increased in fiscal year 2024 due largely to revenue contributions from the acquisition of a controlling interest in Noveprim, as well as increased pricing for small research models. Offsetting this growth, the challenging biopharmaceutical demand environment led to lower revenue for research model services, including Insourcing Solution’s CRADL\nTM\n operations. However, CRADL\nTM\n continues to be an attractive business model as a cost-effective and flexible solution for clients allowing access to vivarium space without having to invest in internal infrastructure. This flexibility is particularly valuable in the current environment, where organizations are seeking to optimize their research budgets and minimize operational costs. We are confident that research models and services will remain essential tools for our clients’ drug discovery and early-stage development efforts.\nRevenue for products and services that support biopharmaceutical clients’ manufacturing activities increased across the Manufacturing Solutions segment in fiscal year 2024. The Microbial Solutions business experienced robust growth as client destocking activity by large biopharmaceutical and CDMO clients was largely completed in the prior year. The growth was further driven by higher revenue of our rapid microbial testing solutions, primarily for Endosafe® testing consumables and instruments. Our Biologics business benefited from improved volumes for biologics quality-control testing services, as well as increased demand for our cell and gene therapy CDMO services during the year. Since the strategic acquisition of the CDMO businesses in 2021, Cognate and Vigene, significant steps have been taken, such as establishing Centers of Excellence for cell therapy, viral vectors, and plasmids, to support the emerging modalities and technologies enhanced operations and capabilities. However, in December 2024, our Biologics business experienced the loss of certain key customers, ultimately resulting in a reduction in its long range financial outlook. As a result, the Company expects lower revenue from commercial clients to impact its CDMO business in 2025. \nIn response to recent trends observed across each of our businesses, we have undertaken and will continue to implement restructuring actions at various locations across North America, Europe, and Asia. This includes workforce right-sizing actions, \n42\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nresulting in severance and transition costs; and costs related to the consolidation of facilities to optimize our global footprint and drive greater operating efficiency across the Company, resulting in asset impairment, accelerated depreciation, and other site consolidation charges. During fiscal 2023, the Company began to take restructuring actions as a result of these emerging business trends. The Company incurred restructuring charges of $107.0 million and $29.7 million during the fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect that these effectuated actions, as well as other upcoming planned actions designed to optimize our global footprint to drive greater operating efficiency, will result in approximately $225 million of cost savings on an annualized basis, of which approximately $100 million impacted fiscal 2024. \nDespite the near-term market pressures, we believe clients will continue to benefit from the long-term value of strategic outsourcing to improve their operating efficiency and to access capabilities that they do not maintain internally. We believe that our comprehensive scientific capabilities and global scale, as well as the breadth and depth of our scientific expertise, quality, and responsiveness remain key criteria when our clients make the decision to outsource to us. As the scientific partner of choice to accelerate biomedical research, we are committed to driving greater efficiency and speed while providing exceptional service to our clients.\nRecent Acquisitions\nWe make strategic acquisitions designed to expand our portfolio of products and services to support the drug discovery and development continuum. We maintain an acquisition strategy that focuses on augmenting internal growth of existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. Our recent transactions are described below.\nOn November 30, 2023, we completed our acquisition of an additional 41% equity interest of Noveprim Group (Noveprim), a leading supplier of non-human primates (NHPs) located in Mauritius, resulting in a 90% controlling interest. We had previously acquired a 49% equity interest in 2022 for $90.0 million plus additional contingent payments up to $5.0 million based on future performance. The total consideration allocable to the Noveprim acquisition is $392.4 million, which includes $144.6 million additional cash paid for the 41% equity interest, elimination of historical activity and intercompany balances of $209.5 million which includes a remeasurement gain on the 49% equity investment of $113.0 million, contingent consideration of $33.3 million, deferred purchase price of $12.0 million payable from 2024 through 2027, offset by estimated post-closing adjustments for working capital of $7.0 million. The purchase price reflected an agreement with the seller on working capital and debt, which was adjusted from $13.8 million to $7.0 million during fiscal year 2024. As a result of measurement period adjustments to the purchase price, goodwill and remeasurement gains on the previous 49% equity investment during fiscal year 2024, were increased by $17.6 million and $9.8 million, respectively. Remeasurement gains are recorded in Other income (expense), net, within the consolidated statements of income. The contingent consideration fair value is estimated using a Monte Carlo Simulation model and the maximum contingent contractual payments are up to $55.0 million based on future performance and milestone achievements from fiscal years 2023 through 2025. The Company has the call option right to purchase the remaining 10% equity interest up until one month after the sixth anniversary of closing the 41% equity interest. On the first anniversary of the expiration of the call option, a 12-month put option will be triggered giving the seller the right to require us to acquire the remaining shares of the seller. The redemption price for the call/put is fixed and ranges from $47.0 million to $54.0 million depending on when exercised. The noncontrolling interest is classified as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets. The acquisition was funded through a combination of available cash and proceeds from our Credit Facility. This business is reported as part of our DSA reportable segment for NHPs vertically integrated into the DSA supply chain and the RMS reportable segment for those NHPs sold to third party customers.\nOn January 27, 2023, we acquired SAMDI Tech, Inc., (SAMDI), a leading provider of high-quality, label-free high-throughput screening (HTS) solutions for drug discovery research. The acquisition of SAMDI will provide clients with seamless access to the premier, label-free HTS MS platform and create a comprehensive, library of drug discovery solutions. The purchase price of SAMDI was $62.8 million, net of $0.4 million in cash, inclusive of a 20% strategic equity interest previously owned by us of $12.6 million. The acquisition was funded through a combination of available cash and proceeds from our Credit Facility. This business is reported as part of our DSA reportable segment.\n43\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nU.S. Government Investigations into Non-Human Primate Supply Chain\nOn February 17, 2023, we received a grand jury subpoena requesting certain documents related to an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) into our conduct regarding several shipments of non-human primates from Cambodia. That investigation remains ongoing and we are continuing to cooperate with the investigation. As also previously disclosed, a parallel civil investigation is being undertaken by the DOJ and USFWS. We are also cooperating with that investigation, and although we continue to dispute the merits of certain positions taken by the DOJ and USFWS in the civil investigation, we have discussed a potential resolution of that matter with\n \nthe DOJ and USFWS. Those discussions are ongoing. Although we maintain a global supplier onboarding and oversight program incorporating risk-based due diligence, auditing, and monitoring practices to help ensure the quality of our supplier relationships and compliance with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations, including the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), in connection with the civil investigation, we have voluntarily suspended future shipments of non-human primates from Cambodia to the United States until such time that we and USFWS can agree upon and implement additional procedures to reasonably ensure that non-human primates imported from Cambodia are purpose-bred. We continue to care for the Cambodia-sourced non-human primates from certain shipments in the United States. Due to a number of factors, including the age of these NHP’s, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recorded a charge of $27 million to costs of products sold within the accompanying consolidated statements of income to reflect the reduction in carrying value of this inventory to zero. On May 16, 2023, we received an inquiry from the Enforcement Division of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting us to voluntarily provide information, subsequently augmented with a document subpoena and additional inquiries, primarily related to the sourcing of non-human primates and related disclosures, and we are cooperating with the requests. Our Audit Committee has retained counsel to conduct an independent investigation into certain issues raised in the investigations, and that work is ongoing. We are not able to predict what action, if any, might be taken in the future by the DOJ, USFWS, SEC or other governmental authorities. None of the DOJ, USFWS or SEC has provided us with any specific timeline or indication as to when these investigations or, specific to the DOJ and USFWS, discussions regarding resolution and future processes and procedures, will be concluded or resolved. We cannot predict the timing, outcome or possible impact of the investigations, including without limitation any potential fines, penalties or liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S.). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on our historical experience, trends in the industry, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is or may be material. We believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer (“transaction price”).\nTo the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the amount to which we expect to be entitled. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available. Sales, value add, and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue.\nWhen determining the transaction price of a contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component. Generally, we do not extend payment terms beyond one year. Applying the practical expedient, we do not assess whether a significant financing \n44\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\ncomponent exists if the period between when we perform our obligations under the contract and when the customer pays is one year or less. Our contracts do not generally contain significant financing components.\nContracts with customers may contain multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised products or services underlying each performance obligation. We determine standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements. Contract modifications exist when the modification either creates new, or changes existing, enforceable rights and obligations. Generally, when contract modifications create new performance obligations, the modification is considered to be a separate contract and revenue is recognized prospectively. When contract modifications change existing performance obligations, the impact on the existing transaction price and measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates is generally recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis.\nProduct revenue is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, and may be upon shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract. Service revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are delivered to the customer based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. Depending on which better depicts the transfer of value to the customer, we generally measure our progress using either cost-to-cost (input method) or right-to-invoice (output method). We use the cost-to-cost measure of progress when it best depicts the transfer of value to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contract, generally related to fixed fee service contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. The costs calculation includes variables such as labor hours, allocation of overhead costs, research model costs, and subcontractor costs. Revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. The right-to-invoice measure of progress is generally related to rate per unit contracts, as the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on discrete service or time-based increments, such as samples tested or labor hours incurred. Revenue is recorded in the amount invoiced since that amount corresponds directly to the value of our performance to date. During fiscal year 2024, $2.4 billion, or approximately 60%, of our total revenue recognized ($4.0 billion) is DSA service and product revenue transferred over time.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets (including goodwill) and certain biological assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in certain recent acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such assets are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the asset will be amortized. We utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income, cost and market approaches, as appropriate, in establishing the fair value of these assets. Typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from these assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets.\nIn our recent acquisitions, customer relationship intangible assets (also referred to as client relationships) and certain biological assets have been the most significant identifiable assets acquired. To determine the fair value of the acquired client relationships and biological assets, we utilized the multiple period excess earnings model (a commonly accepted valuation technique), which includes the following key assumptions: projections of cash flows from the acquired entities, which included future revenue, cost of revenue, operating income margins, customer attrition rates, productivity rates; as well as discount rates based on a market participant’s weighted average cost of capital. During fiscal year 2024, we did not enter into any acquisitions. The value of the client relationship acquired was $23 million and the value of the biological assets acquired was $168 million for fiscal year 2023. \nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include, but are not limited to, unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key customers or personnel, and acts by governments and courts. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment.\n45\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nWe perform the quantitative impairment test where we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. If the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023 we performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for our reporting units. Fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a market-based approach and an income approach, as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the market-based approach, we utilized information about our company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples and sales multiples that are used to value our reporting units. Under the income approach, we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. \nDuring the third quarter ended September 28, 2024, a triggering event was identified for the Discovery Services reporting unit (part of the DSA reportable segment). This resulted from a continuous decline in market conditions and operational challenges, ultimately resulting in a reduction of Discovery Services’ long range financial outlook. In response, we conducted a quantitative impairment test for goodwill to determine if the goodwill in the Discovery Services reporting unit was impaired. Upon completion of a quantitative impairment test, it was determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 22%, and no impairment was recognized as of September 28, 2024. As of the annual impairment test date, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16% and no impairment was recognized as of December 28, 2024. While the Discovery Services reporting unit is not currently impaired, we will continue to closely monitor future performance and any potential impacts on the value of the reporting unit. If the estimated future cash flows decrease below our current expectations, specifically as a result of lower revenue growth rates or lower operating income margins, or due to an increase of the weighted-average cost of capital, the fair value may decrease below the carrying value, which may result in a material goodwill impairment.\nDuring the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2024, a triggering event was identified for the Biologics Solutions reporting unit after the annual impairment assessment. This resulted from a loss of key customers, ultimately resulting in a reduction in Biologics Solutions’ long range financial outlook. In response, we conducted a quantitative impairment test for goodwill to determine if the goodwill in the Biologics Solutions reporting unit was impaired. The fair value of the Biologics Solutions reporting unit tested for impairment during 2024 was determined based on a discounted cash flow model (an income approach) and earnings multiples (a market approach) based on the guideline public company method. Significant assumptions used in the determination of fair value of the Biologics Solutions reporting unit generally include forecasted cash flows, discount rates, terminal growth rates and earnings multiples. The discounted cash flow model used to determine the fair value of the Biologics Solutions reporting unit as of the impairment triggering date reflected assumptions related to revenue growth rates, operating income margins, discount rate and terminal growth rate. The Biologics Solutions reporting unit fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because they involve significant unobservable inputs.\nUpon completion of a quantitative impairment test, it was determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment of approximately $215.0 million. We will continue to closely monitor future performance and any potential impacts on the value of the reporting unit. If the estimated future cash flows decrease below our current expectations, specifically as a result of lower revenue growth rates or operating income margins, or due to an increase of the weighted-average cost of capital, the fair value may further decrease resulting in an incremental material goodwill impairment.\nOur 2024 and 2023 impairment tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any other reporting units. \nValuation and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets to be held and used, principally definite-lived intangible assets, biological assets, right-of-use lease assets, and property, plant, and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nsignificant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;\n•\nloss of key customers;\n•\nsignificant negative industry or economic trends; or\n•\nsignificant changes or developments in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long-lived assets.\nDetermination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset group, net of any sublease income, if applicable, and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values. We \n46\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nmeasure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Significant judgments are required to estimate future cash flows, including the selection of appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. We may also estimate fair value based on market prices for similar assets, as appropriate. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for these assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. \nDuring the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2024, a triggering event was identified for the Cell Therapy asset group within the Biologics Solutions business as there was a loss of key customers, resulting in a significant reduction in cash flows. We concluded there were no impairments for the asset group related to this triggering event, however the remaining useful life of the intangible asset within the asset group was reduced to less than 1 year. \nLong-lived asset impairments associated with our right-of-use lease assets and property, plant, and equipment, recognized during fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were $51.8 million and $41.9 million, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and the effects of tax planning strategies. Our valuation allowance was $286.8 million as of December 28, 2024. In the event actual results differ from our estimates, we will adjust our estimates in future periods and may establish additional allowances or reversals as necessary. \nWe account for uncertain tax positions using a “more-likely-than-not” threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors, that include, but are not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. We adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the “more-likely-than-not” threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the controversy process. We consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews; we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position; and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would re-examine the related tax position. We also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe generally receive a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees, or the vesting of restricted stock and performance share units held by employees. The stock price, timing, and amount of vesting and exercising of stock-based compensation could materially impact our current tax expense.\nOur global operations make the effective tax rate sensitive to significant tax law changes. Several countries have begun to enact legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) international tax framework, including the Pillar II global minimum tax regime with effect from January 1, 2024 or later. We are currently monitoring these developments. To date, we have not nor, expect there to be a material financial impact.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n47\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations and Liquidity\nRevenue for fiscal year 2024 was $4.0 billion compared to $4.1 billion in fiscal year 2023. The 2024 decrease as compared to the corresponding period in 2023 was $79.4 million, or 1.9%, and was primarily due to our DSA business, which experienced lower volume driven by more cautious client spending as a result of the biopharmaceutical demand environment; partially offset by higher revenue within our Manufacturing businesses and the recent acquisition of Noveprim within our RMS business when compared to fiscal year 2023.\nIn fiscal year 2024, our operating income and operating income margin were $227.3 million and 5.6%, respectively, compared with $617.3 million and 14.9%, respectively, in fiscal year 2023. The decreases in operating income and operating income margins for fiscal year 2024 were primarily due to the revenue impacts described above, charge related to the goodwill impairment within our Manufacturing business, recent restructuring activities, including severance, asset impairments, and other site consolidation costs, and an inventory charge incurred in connection with the investigations by the U.S. government into the non-human primate supply chain.\nNet income available to Charles River Laboratories International Inc, common shareholders decreased to $10.3 million in fiscal year 2024, from $474.6 million in the corresponding period of 2023. The decrease in net income available to common shareholders of $464.3 million was due principally to the decreases in operating income described above.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, our cash flows from operations was $734.6 million compared with $683.9 million for fiscal year 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to favorable performance across our revenue related accounts, including collections on trade receivables, deferred revenue, and customer deposits; benefiting cash provided by operations by $46.7 million, lower purchases of inventory supporting our Safety Assessment business, benefiting our cash provided by operations by $16.8 million; partially offset by $27.6 million related to accrued compensation, and timing of payments to our suppliers and vendors reducing our cash provided by operations by $14.3 million.\nRevenue and Operating Income\nThe following tables present consolidated revenue by type and by reportable segment:\nFiscal Year\n2024\n2023\n$ change\n% change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nService revenue\n$\n3,304,138 \n$\n3,440,019 \n$\n(135,881)\n(4.0)\n%\nProduct revenue\n745,851 \n689,390 \n56,461 \n8.2 \n%\n$\n4,049,989 \n$\n4,129,409 \n$\n(79,420)\n(1.9)\n%\nFiscal Year\n2024\n2023\n$ change\n% change\nImpact of FX\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRMS\n$\n829,377 \n$\n792,343 \n$\n37,034 \n4.7 \n%\n(0.2)\n%\nDSA\n2,451,280 \n2,615,623 \n(164,343)\n(6.3)\n%\n0.2 \n%\nManufacturing\n769,332 \n721,443 \n47,889 \n6.6 \n%\n(0.2)\n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n4,049,989 \n$\n4,129,409 \n$\n(79,420)\n(1.9)\n%\n0.1 \n%\n48\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nAnalysis of Segment Results\nThe following table presents operating income (loss) by reportable segment:\nFiscal Year\n2024\n2023\n$ change\n% change\nImpact of FX\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRMS\n$\n114,411 \n$\n154,666 \n$\n(40,255)\n(26.0)\n%\n(0.3)\n%\nDSA\n442,510 \n606,076 \n(163,566)\n(27.0)\n%\n0.6 \n%\nManufacturing\n(71,453)\n88,329 \n(159,782)\n(180.9)\n%\n(0.9)\n%\nUnallocated corporate\n(258,121)\n(231,810)\n(26,311)\n11.4 \n%\n0.2 \n%\nTotal operating income\n$\n227,347 \n$\n617,261 \n$\n(389,914)\n(63.2)\n%\n0.3 \n%\nOperating income % of revenue\n5.6 \n%\n14.9 \n%\n(930) bps\nThe following presents and discusses our consolidated financial results by each of our reportable segments:\nRMS\nFiscal Year\n2024\n2023\n$ change\n% change\nImpact of FX\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRevenue\n$\n829,377 \n$\n792,343 \n$\n37,034 \n4.7 \n%\n(0.2)\n%\nCost of revenue (excluding amortization of intangible assets)\n580,491 \n509,970 \n70,521 \n13.8 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n110,982 \n105,965 \n5,017 \n4.7 \n%\nAmortization of intangible assets\n23,493 \n21,742 \n1,751 \n8.1 \n%\nOperating income\n$\n114,411 \n$\n154,666 \n$\n(40,255)\n(26.0)\n%\n(0.3)\n%\nOperating income % of revenue\n13.8 \n%\n19.5 \n%\n(570) bps\nRMS revenue increased $37.0 million due primarily to an increase in large research model product revenue, principally due to the recent acquisition of Noveprim, which contributed $39.4 million, and an increase in small research model revenue in all geographic areas; partially offset by lower Cell Solutions product revenue and Insourcing Solutions services revenue.\nRMS operating income decreased $40.3 million compared to fiscal year 2023.

The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily attributable to the impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment of the Biologic Solutions reporting unit, as well as the non-taxable gain on Noveprim of $98.5 million in fiscal year 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Cash Flows\nWe currently require cash to fund our working capital needs, capital expansion, acquisitions, debt payments, lease, venture capital and strategic equity investments, and pension obligations. Our principal sources of liquidity have been our cash flows from operations and recent divestitures, supplemented by long-term borrowings. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to financing resources, are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. \nThe following table presents our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments:\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents:\nHeld in U.S. entities\n$\n4,219 \n$\n2,234 \nHeld in non-U.S. entities\n190,387 \n274,537 \nTotal cash and cash equivalents\n194,606 \n276,771 \nShort-term investments:\nHeld in non-U.S. entities\n62 \n68 \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n$\n194,668 \n$\n276,839 \nThe following table presents our net cash provided by operating activities:\nFiscal Year\n2024\n2023\n(in thousands)\nNet income\n$\n25,291 \n$\n480,370 \nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities\n739,615 \n305,908 \nChanges in assets and liabilities\n(30,329)\n(102,380)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n734,577 \n$\n683,898 \nNet cash provided by cash flows from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to favorable performance across our revenue related accounts, including collections on trade receivables, deferred revenue, and customer deposits; benefiting cash provided by operations by $46.7 million, lower purchases of inventory supporting our Safety Assessment business, benefiting our cash provided by operations by $16.8 million; partially offset by $27.6 million related to accrued compensation, and timing of payments to our suppliers and vendors reducing our cash provided by operations by $14.3 million. \nThe following table presents our net cash used in investing activities:\nFiscal Year\n2024\n2023\n(in thousands)\nAcquisitions of businesses and assets, net of cash acquired\n$\n(5,479)\n$\n(194,785)\nCapital expenditures\n(232,967)\n(318,528)\nInvestments, net\n(11,189)\n(47,548)\nOther, net\n4,549 \n(2,294)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(245,086)\n$\n(563,155)\nInvesting activities primarily consist of cash used to fund capital expenditures to support the growth of our business, purchases and sales of investments related to our venture capital and strategic equity investment portfolios, and asset and business acquisitions and divestitures.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by capital expenditures, an immaterial asset acquisition, and net purchases and sales in investments related to certain venture capital and strategic equity investments. Capital expenditures declined for the fiscal year 2024 compared to 2023, primarily as a result of disciplined spend management in light of the global economic and demand environment. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2023 primarily related to the acquisitions of Noveprim and SAMDI, capital expenditures to support the growth of the business, and investments in certain venture capital and strategic equity investments.\nThe following table presents our net cash used in\n financing ac\ntivities:\nFiscal Year\n2024\n2023\n(in thousands)\nProceeds from long-term debt and revolving credit facility\n$\n1,081,581 \n$\n776,353 \nProceeds from exercises of stock options\n23,878 \n25,597 \nPayments on long-term debt, revolving credit facility, and finance lease obligations\n(1,493,769)\n(851,676)\nPurchase of treasury stock\n(119,175)\n(24,155)\nPurchase of remaining equity interest of other redeemable noncontrolling interest\n(12,000)\n(4,784)\nPayment of contingent considerations\n— \n(2,711)\nOther, net\n(31,442)\n(4,145)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$\n(550,927)\n$\n(85,521)\nFinancing activities primarily consist of the proceeds and repayments of debt and certain equity related transactions including treasury stock purchases and employee stock option exercises. For fiscal year 2024, net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by the following activity:\n•\nNet repayments of $417.1 million towards our Credit Facility\n•\nTreasury stock purchases of $100.7 million associated with our stock repurchase program and $18.5 million due to the netting of common stock upon vesting of stock-based awards in order to satisfy individual statutory tax withholding requirements\n•\nNet proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $23.9 million\n•\nNet dividend payments to noncontrolling interest holders of $14.5 million\n52\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nFor fiscal year 2023, net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by the following activity:\n•\nNet repayments of $70.9 million towards our Credit Facility. \n•\nTreasury stock purchases of \n$24.2 million \nmade due to the netting of common stock upon vesting of stock-based awards in order to satisfy individual statutory tax withholding requirements\n•\nInitial payment to purchase the remaining 8% interest in our Vital River subsidiary of $4.8 million\n•\nDividends paid to noncontrolling interests $4.0 million\n•\nContingent consideration payments of $2.7 million\n•\nNet proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $25.6 million\nFinancing and Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities.\nAmounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and our Senior Notes were as follows:\nDecember 28, 2024\nDecember 30, 2023\n(in thousands)\nRevolving credit facility\n$\n714,948 \n$\n1,129,243 \n4.25% Senior Notes due 2028\n500,000 \n500,000 \n3.75% Senior Notes due 2029\n500,000 \n500,000 \n4.0% Senior Notes due 2031\n500,000 \n500,000 \nTotal\n$\n2,214,948 \n$\n2,629,243 \nOn December 13, 2024, the Company modified its revolving credit facility “Credit Facility”. The Credit Facility provides for up to $2.0 billion in multi-currency revolving credit (reduced from $3.0 billion) and has a maturity date of December 2029 (previously April 2026), with no required scheduled payment before that date. The terms of the Credit Facility are substantially the same with the interest rates equal to (A) for revolving loans denominated in U.S. dollars, at the Company’s option, either the base rate (which is the higher of (1) the prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (3) the one-month adjusted SOFR rate plus 1.0%) or the adjusted SOFR rate, (B) for revolving loans denominated in euros, the adjusted EURIBOR rate and (C) for revolving loans denominated in sterling, the daily simple SONIA rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Company’s leverage ratio. \nOur 2028 Senior Notes have semiannual interest payments due May 1 and November 1. Our 2029 and 2031 Senior Notes have semiannual interest payments due March 15 and September 15. \nWe had an interest rate swap with a notional amount of \n$500 million\n to manage interest rate fluctuation related to our floating rate borrowings under the revolving credit facility, at a fixed rate of 4.65%. Our swap matured on November 2, 2024 and we have not entered into any additional interest rate swap contracts.\nOur off-balance sheet commitments related to our outstanding letters of credit as of December 28, 2024 were $22.4 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWhile the financial results of our global activities are reported in U.S. dollars, our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective local currency. The principal functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, and Mauritian Rupee. During fiscal year 2024, the most significant drivers of foreign currency translation adjustment we recorded as part of other comprehensive income (loss) were the Euro, Canadian Dollar, and Mauritian Rupee.\nFluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. As the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the value of our non-U.S. revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash flows will generally decline when reported in U.S. dollars. The impact to net income as a result of a U.S. dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of non-U.S. expenses, which will decline when reported in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash flows will generally increase when reported in U.S. dollars. For fiscal year 2024, our revenue would \n53\nCHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nhave decreased by $129.8 million, and our operating income would have decreased by $8.0 million, if the U.S. dollar exchange rate had strengthened by 1\n0%, with all other variables held constant.\nWe attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy. We do not enter into speculative derivative agreements.\nRepurchases of Common Stock\nOn August 2, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase authorization of $1.0 billion. This authorization fully replaces a prior stock repurchase authorization of $1.3 billion that had $129.1 million remaining when it was terminated, and we did not repurchase any shares under the prior program during fiscal year 2024.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of common stock for $100.7 million under the new stock repurchase program. As of December 28, 2024, we had $899.3 million remaining on the authorized stock repurchase program. We intend to repurchase shares in fiscal year 2025 totaling approximately $350 million.\nAdditionally, our stock-based compensation plans permit the netting of common stock upon vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance share units in order to satisfy individual statutory tax withholding requirements. During fiscal year 2024 and 2023, we acquired 0.1 million shares for $18.5 million and $24.2 million, respectively, through such netting. \nCommitments and Other Purchasing Arrangements\nWe lease properties and equipment for use in our operations. In addition to rent, the leases may require us to pay additional amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses. As of December 28, 2024, we had $701.4 million of operating leases inclusive of future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, net of income from subleases as well as $38.5 million of financing leases. The expected payments of our operating and finance lease liabilities over the next twelve months are $77.9 million and $4.2 million, respectively as of December 28, 2024. \nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 28, 2024, we entered into unconditional purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business. Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty. As of December 28, 2024, we had approximately $379 million of unconditional purchase obligations, the majority of which are expected to be settled during 2025.\nWe invest in several venture capital funds that invest in start-up companies, primarily in the life sciences industry. Our total commitment to the funds as of December 28, 2024 was $215.8 million, of which we funded $167.3 million through December 28, 2024. Refer to Note 8. Venture Capital and Strategic Equity Investments to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nIn connection with certain business and asset acquisitions, we agreed to make additional payments based upon the achievement of certain financial targets and other milestones in connection with the respective acquisition. As of December 28, 2024, we had approximately $55 million of gross contingent payments, of which $49 million is the current fair value.\nWe have certain federal and state income tax liabilities of $17.9 million relating to the one-time Transition Tax on unrepatriated earnings under the 2017 Tax Act. The Transition Tax will be paid, interest free, with a final payment in 2025.",
