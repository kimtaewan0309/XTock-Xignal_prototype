Ameren’s subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets, and liabilities. Dividends on Ameren’s common stock and the payment of expenses by Ameren depend on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries.\nBelow is a summary description of Ameren’s principal subsidiaries – Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. Ameren also has other subsidiaries that conduct other activities, such as providing shared services. A more detailed description can be found in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\n•\nAmeren Missouri operates a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission, and distribution business and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution business in Missouri.\n•\nAmeren Illinois operates rate-regulated electric transmission, electric distribution, and natural gas distribution businesses in Illinois.\n•\nATXI operates a FERC rate-regulated electric transmission business in the MISO.\nFor additional information about the development of our businesses, our business operations, and factors affecting our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nAmeren has four segments: Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Transmission. The Ameren Missouri segment includes all of the operations of Ameren Missouri. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution consists of the electric distribution business of Ameren Illinois. Ameren Illinois Natural Gas consists of the natural gas business of Ameren Illinois. Ameren Transmission primarily consists of the aggregated electric transmission businesses of Ameren Illinois and ATXI.\nAmeren Missouri has one segment. Ameren Illinois has three segments: Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Illinois Transmission.\n7\nTable\n of Contents\nAn illustration of the Ameren Companies’ reporting structures is provided below:\n(a)    Ameren Missouri consolidates AMF, which is wholly owned by Ameren Missouri.\n(b)    The Ameren Transmission segment also includes allocated Ameren (parent) interest charges, as well as other subsidiaries engaged in electric transmission project development and investment.\nRATES AND REGULATION\nRates\nThe rates that Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are allowed to charge for their utility services significantly influence the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of these companies and Ameren. The electric and natural gas utility industry is highly regulated. The utility rates charged to customers are determined by governmental entities, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and the FERC. Decisions by these entities are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, the prudency of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, customer intervention, and economic conditions, as well as social and political views. Decisions made by these governmental entities regarding customer rates are largely outside of our control. These decisions, as well as the regulatory lag involved in the process of obtaining approval for new customer rates, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of the Ameren Companies. The extent of the regulatory lag varies for each of Ameren’s electric and natural gas jurisdictions, with the Ameren Transmission business experiencing the least amount of regulatory lag. Depending on the jurisdiction, the effects of regulatory lag are mitigated by various means, including annual revenue requirement reconciliations, the decoupling of revenues from sales volumes to ensure revenues approved in a regulatory rate review are not affected by changes in sales volumes, the recovery of certain capital investments between traditional regulatory rate reviews, the level and timing of expenditures, the use of future test years to establish customer rates, and the use of trackers and riders.\nThe MoPSC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Missouri. The ICC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Illinois. The MoPSC and the ICC regulate non-rate utility matters for ATXI. ATXI does not have retail distribution customers; therefore, the MoPSC and the ICC do not have authority to regulate ATXI’s rates. The FERC regulates Ameren Missouri’s, Ameren Illinois’, and ATXI’s cost-based rates for the wholesale transmission and distribution of energy in interstate commerce and various other matters discussed below under General Regulatory Matters.\n8\nTable\n of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the key terms of the rate orders in effect for customer billings for each of Ameren’s utilities as of January 1, 2025, except as noted:\nRate Regulator\nEffective\nRate Order\nIssued In\nRates Effective\nAllowed\nROE\nPercent of\nCommon Equity\nRate Base\n(in billions)\nPortion of Ameren’s 2024 Operating Revenues\n(a)\nAmeren Missouri\nElectric service\n(b)\nMoPSC\nJune 2023\nJuly 2023\n(c)\n(c)\n(c)\n50%\nNatural gas delivery service\nMoPSC\nDecember 2021\nFebruary 2022\n(d)\n(d)\n$0.3\n2%\nAmeren Illinois\nElectric distribution delivery service\n(e)\nICC\nDecember 2024\n(e)\n8.72%\n50.00%\n(e)\n27%\nNatural gas delivery service\n(f)\nICC\nNovember 2023\nNovember 2023\n9.44%\n50.00%\n$2.8\n12%\nElectric transmission service\n(g)\nFERC\n(g)\nJanuary 2025\n10.48%\n54.91%\n$4.4\n6%\nATXI\nElectric transmission service\n(g)\nFERC\n(g)\nJanuary 2025\n10.48%\n60.08%\n$1.6\n3%\n(a)\nIncludes pass-through costs recovered from customers, such as purchased power for electric distribution delivery service and natural gas purchased for resale for natural gas delivery service, and intercompany eliminations.\n(b)\nAmeren Missouri’s electric generation, transmission, and delivery service rates are bundled together and charged to retail customers under a combined electric service rate. Because the bundled rates charged to MoPSC retail customers include the revenue requirement associated with Ameren Missouri's FERC-regulated transmission services, the table above does not separately reflect a FERC-authorized rate base or allowed ROE.\n(c)\nThis rate order did not specify an ROE, capital structure, or rate base.\n(d)\nThis rate order did not specify an ROE or a capital structure.\n(e)\nIn December 2024, the ICC issued an order in Ameren Illinois’ MYRP proceeding. The order approved an average annual rate base for 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027 of $4.2 billion, $4.4 billion, $4.6 billion, and $4.8 billion, respectively. Rate changes consistent with the December 2024 order became effective in late December 2024. Under an MYRP, Ameren Illinois will reconcile its actual revenue requirement, as adjusted for certain cost variations, to ICC-approved electric distribution service rates on an annual basis, subject to a reconciliation cap. The reconciliation cap limits the annual adjustment to 105% of the annual revenue requirement approved by the ICC.\n(f)\nThis rate order was based on a 2024 future test year.\n(g)\nTransmission rates are updated annually and become effective each January. They are determined by a company-specific, forward-looking formula ratemaking framework based on each year’s forecasted information. The 10.48% return, which includes a 50-basis-point incentive adder for participation in an RTO, is based on the FERC’s October 2024 order.\nFor additional information on Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI rate matters, see Results of Operations and Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nGeneral Regulatory Matters\nAmeren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI must receive FERC approval to enter into various transactions, such as issuing short-term debt securities and conducting certain acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations. In addition, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI must receive authorization from the applicable state public utility regulatory agency to issue stock and long-term debt securities and to conduct mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other activities.\nAmeren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are also subject to mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards adopted by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the bulk electric power system. These standards are developed and enforced by the NERC, pursuant to authority delegated to it by the FERC. Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are members of the SERC. The SERC is one of six regional entities and represents all or portions of 16 central and southeastern states under authority from the NERC for the purpose of implementing and enforcing reliability standards approved by the FERC. Ameren Missouri is also a member of the MRO, which is also one of the six regional entities and represents all or portions of 16 central, southern, and midwestern states, as well as two Canadian provinces, under authority from the NERC. The regional entities of the NERC work to safeguard the reliability of the bulk power systems throughout North America. If any of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, or ATXI is found not to be in compliance with these mandatory reliability standards, it could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.\nUnder the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, the FERC and the state public utility regulatory agencies in each state Ameren and its subsidiaries operate in may access books and records of Ameren and its subsidiaries that are found to be relevant to costs incurred by Ameren’s rate-regulated subsidiaries that may affect jurisdictional rates. The act also permits the MoPSC and the ICC to request that the FERC review cost allocations by Ameren Services to other Ameren subsidiaries.\nOperation of Ameren Missouri’s Callaway Energy Center is subject to regulation by the NRC. The license for the Callaway Energy Center expires in 2044. Ameren Missouri’s hydroelectric Osage Energy Center and pumped-storage hydroelectric Taum Sauk Energy Center, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to FERC regulations affecting, among other aspects, the general operation and maintenance of the projects. The licenses for the Osage Energy Center and the Taum Sauk Energy Center expire in 2047 and 2044, respectively. Ameren Missouri’s Keokuk Energy Center and its dam on the Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois, and Keokuk, Iowa, \n9\nTable\n of Contents\nare operated under authority granted by an Act of Congress in 1905. The Keokuk Energy Center dam safety program is regulated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.\nFor additional information on regulatory matters, see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 9 – Callaway Energy Center, and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur electric generation, transmission, and distribution and natural gas distribution and storage operations must comply with a variety of statutes and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety. These environmental statutes and regulations are comprehensive and include the storage, handling, and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances, emergency planning and response requirements, limitations and standards applicable to discharges from our facilities into the air or water that are enforced through permitting requirements, and natural resource protection laws, including those related to endangered species. Federal and state authorities periodically review and modify existing regulations and adopt new regulations, which may impact our planning process and the ultimate implementation of these or other new or revised regulations. Recent and potential new executive orders issued by the current federal administration as well as local and state land use requirements can also impact our planning activities.\nFor discussion of environmental matters, including NO\nx\n and SO\n2\n emission reduction requirements, regulation of CO\n2 \nemissions, wastewater discharge standards, remediation efforts, and CCR management regulations, and a discussion of litigation against Ameren Missouri with respect to NSR, the Clean Air Act, and Missouri law in connection with projects at Ameren Missouri’s Rush Island Energy Center, see Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nTRANSMISSION\nAmeren owns an integrated transmission system that is composed of the transmission assets of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. Ameren also operates two MISO balancing authority areas: AMMO and AMIL. The AMMO balancing authority area includes the load and most energy centers of Ameren Missouri, and had a peak demand of 7,560 MWs in 2024. The AMIL balancing authority area includes the load of Ameren Illinois and certain Ameren Missouri energy centers located in Illinois, and had a peak demand of 8,479 MWs in 2024. The Ameren transmission system directly connects with 15 other balancing authority areas for the exchange of electric energy.\nAmeren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are transmission-owning members of the MISO. Ameren Missouri is authorized by the MoPSC to participate in the MISO for an indefinite term, subject to the MoPSC’s authority to require future proceedings if an event or circumstance occurs that significantly affects Ameren Missouri’s position in the MISO. Ameren Illinois’ election to participate in the MISO is subject to the ICC’s oversight.\nSUPPLY OF ELECTRIC POWER\nCapacity\nAmeren Missouri sells all of its capacity to the MISO and purchases the capacity it needs to supply its native load sales from the MISO. Ameren Illinois purchases capacity from the MISO and through bilateral contracts resulting from IPA procurement events. In 2022, the FERC issued an order approving changes to the annual MISO capacity auction. Historically, the auctions were designed to cover annual peak demand plus a target reserve margin. Beginning with the April 2023 auction for the June 2023 to May 2024 planning year, auctions include four seasonal load forecasts and available capacity levels and are designed to cover each season’s peak demand plus a target reserve margin. The seasonal auction structure was established to help to address variability in resources as the MISO begins to rely more heavily on renewable generation.\nAmeren Missouri\nAmeren Missouri’s electric supply is primarily generated from its energy centers. Factors that could cause Ameren Missouri to purchase power include, among other things, energy center outages, the fulfillment of renewable energy requirements, extreme weather conditions, the availability of power at a cost lower than its generation cost, and the lack of sufficient owned generation availability.\nAmeren Missouri files a long-term nonbinding preferred resource plan with the MoPSC every three years. The most recent preferred resource plan was filed in September 2023. Ameren Missouri expects to file a notice of change in its preferred resource plan with the MoPSC in February 2025 to address new load growth opportunities resulting from entities in various industries, including data center and manufacturing, that are considering either locating or expanding their operations within Ameren Missouri’s service territory. The 2025 Change to the 2023 PRP is expected to include, among other things, the following:\n10\nTable\n of Contents\n•\nadding 1,600 MWs of natural gas-fired simple-cycle generation by 2030, which includes the 800-MW Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project discussed in Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report, and an additional 1,200 MWs by 2043;\n•\nadding 2,100 MWs of natural gas-fired combined-cycle generation by 2035 and an additional 1,200 MWs by 2040;\n•\nadding 3,200 MWs of renewable generation by 2030, which includes the 900 MWs of solar generation projects discussed in Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report, and an additional 1,500 MWs by 2035;\n•\nadding 1,000 MWs of battery storage by 2030 and an additional 800 MWs by 2042;\n•\nadding 1,500 MWs of nuclear generation by 2040;\n•\nretiring all of Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired energy centers by 2042;\n•\nretiring 1,800 MWs of Ameren Missouri’s natural gas-fired energy centers by 2040 to comply with Illinois law;\n•\nthe continued implementation of customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs; and\n•\nthe expectation that Ameren Missouri will seek and receive NRC approval for an extension of the operating license for the Callaway Energy Center beyond its current 2044 expiration date.\nThe addition of renewable, natural gas-fired, or nuclear generation facilities is subject to obtaining necessary project approvals, including FERC approval and the issuance of a CCN by the MoPSC, as applicable. Ameren Missouri would be adversely affected if the MoPSC does not allow recovery of the remaining investment and decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of an energy center, as well as the ability to earn a return on that remaining investment and those decommissioning costs. The next preferred resource plan is required to be filed by October 2026.\nAmeren Missouri continues to evaluate its longer-term needs for new generating capacity. The need for investment in new sources of energy is dependent on several key factors, including continuation of and customer participation in energy-efficiency programs, the amount of distributed generation from customers, load growth, including demand from data centers, technological advancements, costs of generation alternatives, environmental regulation of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants, changes in United States energy policy and priorities under the current federal administration, and state renewable energy requirements, which could lead to the retirement of current baseload assets before the end of their current useful lives or alterations in the way those assets operate, which could result in increased capital expenditures and/or increased operations and maintenance expenses. Because of the significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload energy center, Ameren Missouri continues to study alternatives and to take steps to preserve options to meet future demand. Steps include evaluating the potential for further diversification of Ameren Missouri’s generation portfolio through renewable energy generation, including wind and solar generation, natural gas-fired generation, including the potential to switch to hydrogen fuel and/or blend hydrogen fuel with natural gas and install carbon capture technology, extending the operating license for the Callaway Energy Center, additional customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs, distributed energy resources, and energy storage.\nMissouri law required Ameren Missouri to offer solar rebates through December 2023 and currently requires Ameren Missouri to offer net metering to certain customers that install renewable generation at their premises. The difference between the cost of the solar rebates and the amount set in base rates was deferred as a regulatory asset or liability under the RESRAM, and earns carrying costs at short-term interest rates. Customers that elect to enroll in net metering are allowed to net their generation against their distribution usage within each billing month.\nAmeren Illinois\nIn Illinois, while electric transmission and distribution service rates are regulated, power supply prices are not. Although electric customers are allowed to purchase power from an alternative retail electric supplier, Ameren Illinois is required to be the provider of last resort for its electric distribution customers. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, Ameren Illinois procured power on behalf of its customers for 25%, 28%, and 28%, respectively, of its total kilowatthour sales. Power purchased by Ameren Illinois for its electric distribution customers who do not elect to purchase their power from an alternative retail electric supplier comes either through procurement processes conducted by the IPA or through markets operated by the MISO. The IPA administers an RFP process through which Ameren Illinois procures its expected supply. The purchased power and related procurement costs incurred by Ameren Illinois are passed directly to its electric distribution customers through a cost recovery mechanism. Transmission costs are charged to customers who purchase electricity from Ameren Illinois through a cost recovery mechanism. The purchased power, power procurement, and transmission costs are reflected in Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution’s results of operations, but do not affect Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution’s earnings because these costs are offset by corresponding revenues. Ameren Illinois charges distribution service rates to electric distribution customers who purchase electricity, regardless of supplier, which does affect Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution’s earnings.\nPursuant to the CEJA, Ameren Illinois is required to file a Grid Plan with the ICC every four years. In December 2024, the ICC issued an order approving Ameren Illinois’ revised Grid Plan under its MYRP proceeding for electric distribution service for 2024 through 2027. For additional information regarding Ameren Illinois’ MYRP proceeding, see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report. The Grid Plan outlines how Ameren Illinois expects to invest in electric distribution infrastructure in order to support grid modernization, clean energy, energy efficiency, and the state of Illinois’ renewable energy, equity, climate, electrification, and environmental \n11\nTable\n of Contents\ngoals. Ameren Illinois’ next Grid Plan is required to be filed by mid-January 2026.\nIllinois law requires Ameren Illinois to offer rebates and net metering to certain customers who install renewable generation or paired energy storage systems at their premises. The cost of the customer generation rebate program is deferred as a regulatory asset, which earns a return at the applicable WACC. Customers that elect to receive a generation rebate and are enrolled in net metering are allowed to net their power supply service charges, but not their distribution service charges. Customers that elect to receive energy storage rebates and have not received generation rebates are allowed to net their power supply and distribution service charges. By law, Ameren Illinois’ electric distribution revenues are decoupled from sales volumes, which ensures that the electric distribution revenues authorized in a regulatory rate review are not affected by changes in sales volumes.\nPOWER GENERATION\nAmeren Missouri owns energy centers that rely on a diverse fuel portfolio, including coal, nuclear, and natural gas, as well as renewable sources of generation. Both of Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired energy centers were constructed prior to 1978. As of December 31, 2024, Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired energy centers represented 6% and 11% of Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s rate base, respectively. The Callaway Energy Center began operation in 1984 and is licensed to operate until 2044. Ameren Illinois operates two solar generation facilities, which are two of three pilot solar projects Ameren Illinois is allowed to invest in under the CEJA. The third solar generation facility is planned to be placed in service before the end of 2026. See Item 2 – Properties under Part I of this report for information regarding our energy centers.\nCoal\nAmeren Missouri has an ongoing need for coal as fuel for generation, and pursues a price-hedging strategy consistent with this requirement. Ameren Missouri has agreements in place to purchase and transport coal to its energy centers. While Ameren Missouri has minimum purchase obligations associated with these agreements, the majority of these agreements are not associated with any specific coal-fired energy center. Ameren Missouri burned approximately 10.7 million tons of coal in 2024. For information regarding the percentages of Ameren Missouri’s projected required supply of coal and coal transportation that are price-hedged through 2029, see Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, of this report.\nAbout 97% of Ameren Missouri’s coal is purchased from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, which has a limited number of suppliers. The remaining coal is typically purchased from the Illinois Basin. Targeted coal inventory levels may be adjusted because of generation levels or uncertainties of supply due to delays in coal deliveries, equipment breakdowns, and other factors. Deliveries from the Powder River Basin have occasionally been restricted because of rail congestion, staffing and equipment issues, infrastructure maintenance, derailments, weather, and supplier financial hardship. Delays and disruptions in coal deliveries could cause Ameren Missouri to pursue a strategy that could include reducing off-system sales of power during low-earning periods, buying higher-cost fuels to generate required electricity, and purchasing power from other sources.\nNuclear\nThe production of nuclear fuel involves the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas, the enrichment of that gas, the conversion of the enriched uranium hexafluoride gas into uranium dioxide fuel pellets, and the fabrication into fuel assemblies. Ameren Missouri has entered into uranium, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment, and fabrication contracts to procure the fuel supply for its Callaway Energy Center.\nThe Callaway Energy Center requires refueling at 18-month intervals. The last refueling was completed in November 2023. The next refueling is scheduled for the spring of 2025. Ameren Missouri has inventories and supply contracts sufficient to meet all of its uranium (concentrate and hexafluoride), conversion, enrichment, and fabrication requirements at least through the spring 2028 refueling.\nRenewable\nAmeren Missouri operates several renewable energy centers, which includes hydroelectric, wind, methane gas, and solar energy centers. The High Prairie and Atchison energy centers are wind generation facilities. The Huck Finn, Boomtown, and Cass County energy centers are solar generation facilities. The Osage and Keokuk energy centers generate electricity using hydroelectric dams located on the Lake of the Ozarks and the Mississippi River, respectively. The Maryland Heights Energy Center generates electricity by burning methane gas collected from a landfill.\nRENEWABLE ENERGY AND ZERO EMISSION STANDARDS\nMissouri and Illinois laws require electric utilities to include renewable energy resources in their portfolios. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois satisfied their renewable energy portfolio requirements in 2024, pending regulatory review by the MoPSC for Ameren Missouri.\n12\nTable\n of Contents\nAmeren Missouri\nIn Missouri, utilities are required to purchase or generate electricity equal to at least 15% of native load sales from renewable energy sources, with at least 2% of the requirement derived from solar energy. The requirement is subject to an average 1% annual limit on increases to customer rates over any 10-year period. For renewable generation facilities located in Missouri, 125% of the electricity generated counts towards meeting the requirement. Ameren Missouri expects to satisfy the requirement in 2025 with its High Prairie, Atchison, Huck Finn, Keokuk, Maryland Heights, and other solar energy centers, along with other renewable energy credits purchased by Ameren Missouri, including solar-generated renewable energy credits purchased from customer-installed systems.\nAmeren Illinois\nIn accordance with Illinois law, Ameren Illinois is required to collect funds from all electric distribution customers to fund IPA procurement events for renewable energy credits. The amount set by law and required to be collected from customers by Ameren Illinois is capped at $4.58 per MWh. The IPA establishes its long-term renewable resources procurement plans in a filing made every two years. In February 2024, the ICC approved the IPA’s latest long-term renewable resources procurement plan, which established the 2024 and 2025 renewable energy credit procurement targets. Based on IPA procurement events that align with the IPA’s plan, Ameren Illinois has contractual commitments to purchase approximately 1.6 million wind renewable energy credits per year and approximately 3.6 million solar renewable energy credits per year. Ameren Illinois has also entered into contracts, ending in 2032, to purchase approximately 0.6 million wind renewable energy credits per year. Pursuant to the CEJA, if funds collected from customers are not used to procure renewable energy credits, they would be refunded to customers pursuant to an annual reconciliation proceeding, the first of which was approved by the ICC in January 2025, which was the June 2017 through May 2018 reconciliation period, and did not result in refunds to customers. Based on amounts collected from customers and obligations under the program, the June 2018 through May 2019 reconciliation period is not expected to result in refunds to customers, pending review by the ICC.\nIllinois law also required Ameren Illinois to enter into contracts to purchase zero emission credits in an amount equal to approximately 16% of the actual amount of electricity delivered to retail customers during calendar year 2014, pursuant to Illinois’ zero emission standard. As a result of a 2018 IPA procurement event, which was approved by the ICC, Ameren Illinois entered into agreements to acquire zero emission credits through May 2027. Annual zero emission credit commitment amounts will be published by the IPA each May prior to the start of the subsequent planning year. Both renewable energy credits and zero emission credits have cost recovery mechanisms, which allow Ameren Illinois to collect from, or refund to, customers differences between actual costs incurred from the purchase of the credits and the amounts collected from customers.\nCUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS\nAmeren Missouri and Ameren Illinois have implemented energy-efficiency programs to educate their customers and to help them become more efficient energy consumers. These programs provide incentives to customers for installing newer, more efficient technology, and for using energy in a more conservation-minded manner. As a component of the energy-efficiency programs, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois have invested in electric smart meters to provide customers more visibility to their energy consumption and facilitate more efficient use of energy. As of December 31, 2024, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois have completed the transition to smart meters, which have been installed for nearly all electric and natural gas customers.\nAmeren Missouri\nIn Missouri, the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act established a rider that, among other things, allows electric utilities to recover costs with respect to MoPSC-approved customer energy-efficiency programs. The law requires the MoPSC to ensure that a utility’s financial incentives are aligned to help customers use energy more efficiently, to provide timely cost recovery, and to provide earnings opportunities associated with cost-effective energy-efficiency and demand response programs. Missouri does not have a law mandating energy-efficiency or demand response programs.\nIn November 2024, the MoPSC issued an order approving a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement for Ameren Missouri’s MEEIA 2025 plan, which includes a portfolio of customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs, along with the continued use of the MEEIA rider. Ameren Missouri intends to invest $51 million annually in 2025 and 2026 and $22 million in 2027 for customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs. In addition, the order approved performance incentives applicable to each plan year to earn revenues by achieving certain spending and demand response goals. If 100% of the goals are achieved in 2025, 2026, and 2027, Ameren Missouri would earn performance incentive revenues of $5 million, $5 million, and $2 million, respectively. Through 2024, Ameren Missouri has invested approximately $415 million in MEEIA 2019 customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs.\nThe MEEIA rider allows Ameren Missouri to collect from customers its actual program costs, lost electric revenues, and any performance incentive, without a traditional regulatory rate review, subject to MoPSC prudence reviews, until lower volumes resulting from \n13\nTable\n of Contents\nthe MEEIA programs are reflected in base rates. Customer rates, based upon both forecasted program costs and lost electric revenues and collected via the MEEIA rider, are reconciled annually to actual results.\nAmeren Illinois\nPursuant to Illinois law, Ameren Illinois offers customer energy-efficiency programs, and is subject to electric energy-efficiency savings goals and a maximum annual amount of investment in electric energy-efficiency programs. Ameren Illinois’ planned investments in electric energy-efficiency programs is approximately $120 million in 2025 and approximately $125 million annually from 2026 to 2029. Every four years, Ameren Illinois is required to file a four-year electric energy-efficiency plan with the ICC. In June 2022, the ICC issued an order approving Ameren Illinois’ electric and natural gas energy-efficiency plans for 2022 through 2025, as well as regulatory recovery mechanisms. The order authorized electric and natural gas energy-efficiency program expenditures of $476 million and $66 million, respectively, over the four-year period. Ameren Illinois is required to file an updated four-year electric energy-efficiency plan with the ICC by March 2025.\nIllinois law allows Ameren Illinois to earn a return on its electric energy-efficiency program investments. Ameren Illinois’ electric energy-efficiency investments are deferred as a regulatory asset and earn a return at the applicable WACC, with the ROE based on the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. The allowed ROE on electric energy-efficiency investments can be increased or decreased by up to 200 basis points, depending on the achievement of annual energy savings goals. While the ICC approves Ameren Illinois’ four-year electric energy-efficiency plans, the ICC has the ability to reduce the amount of approved electric energy-efficiency savings goals in future plan program years if there are insufficient cost-effective programs available, which could reduce the investments in electric energy-efficiency programs.\n \nThe electric energy-efficiency program investments and the return on those investments are collected from customers through a rider and are not included in the electric distribution service MYRP framework. Ameren Illinois’ natural gas energy-efficiency program costs are recovered through a rider.\nNATURAL GAS SUPPLY FOR DISTRIBUTION\nAmeren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are responsible for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to their customers. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois each develop and manage a portfolio of natural gas supply resources. These resources include firm natural gas supply agreements, firm interstate and intrastate transportation capacity, firm no-notice storage capacity leased from interstate pipelines, and on-system storage facilities to maintain natural gas deliveries to customers throughout the year and especially during peak demand periods. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois primarily use Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, Mississippi River Transmission Corporation, Northern Border Pipeline Company, MoGas Pipeline, and Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation interstate pipeline systems to transport natural gas to their systems. In addition to transactions requiring physical delivery, certain financial instruments, including those entered into in the over-the-counter financial markets, are used to hedge the price paid for natural gas. Natural gas supply costs are passed on to customers of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois under PGA clauses, subject to prudence reviews by the MoPSC and the ICC. For information regarding the percentage of Ameren Missouri’s and Ameren Illinois’ projected remaining natural gas supply requirements that are price-hedged through 2029, see Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, of this report.\nFor additional information on our fuel, purchased power, and natural gas for distribution supply, see Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and Commodity Price Risk under Part II, Item 7A, of this report. Also see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 7 – Derivative Financial Instruments, Note 13 – Related-party Transactions, Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 15 – Supplemental Information under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nThe execution of Ameren’s core strategy to invest in rate-regulated energy infrastructure, enhance regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible policies, and optimize operating performance to capitalize on opportunities to benefit our customers, communities, shareholders, and the environment is driven by the capabilities and engagement of our workforce. Ameren’s workforce strategy is designed to promote a skilled workforce that is well-prepared to deliver on Ameren’s mission (\nTo Power the Quality of Life\n) and vision (\nLeading the Way to a Sustainable Energy Future\n), both today and in the future. Our workforce strategy is anchored in four key pillars: Culture, Leadership, Talent, and Rewards, which are discussed further below. Foundational to our workforce strategy are our core competencies of:\n•\nBe Strategic\n•\nContinuously Improve\n•\nDeliver Results\n•\nEngage Respectfully\n•\nFoster Collaboration\n•\nThink Customer\nAmeren’s chief executive officer and chief human resources officer, with the support of other leaders of the Ameren Companies, are responsible for developing and executing our workforce strategy. In addition to reviewing and determining the Ameren Companies’ \n14\nTable\n of Contents\ncompensation practices and policies for the chief executive officer and other executive officers, the Human Resources Committee of Ameren’s board of directors is responsible for oversight of Ameren’s human capital management practices and policies. The Human Resources Committee and Ameren’s board of directors are updated regularly on human capital matters.\nCulture\nWe strive to cultivate a mission-driven, values-based culture that enables the sustainable execution of our core strategy.\nWe design our human capital management practices and policies to reinforce our values, shape our culture, and drive employee engagement. In doing so, we strive to align our employees to our mission and vision, improve safety, continuously improve operating performance, attract and retain top talent, and recognize employee contributions, among other things. We assess employee engagement through a variety of channels. As a part of our assessment, we conduct confidential employee engagement surveys to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement in our employees’ experience, and take actions aimed at increasing employee engagement. We also offer flexible work arrangements, such as permitting certain employees to work from alternate locations or to make adjustments to an employee’s daily work hours, among other things, complemented by our work to advance the digital enablement of our workforce, and have enhanced our facilities and workforce policies and practices to increase collaboration and productivity.\nAs a part of our culture, every employee is expected to challenge any unsafe act, complete each workday safely, and provide feedback on safety and security matters. In addition to comprehensive safety and security standards, and mandatory health, safety, and security training programs for applicable employees, we promote programs designed to encourage employees to provide feedback on practices or actions that could harm employees, customers, or the Ameren Companies, including perceived issues related to safety, security (both physical and cyber), ethics and compliance violations, or acts of discrimination.\nLeadership\nAmeren’s leaders play a critical role in setting and executing Ameren’s strategic initiatives, modeling our values and culture, and engaging and enabling the workforce. As such, we seek to develop a strong leadership team with a variety of experiences and perspectives. Management engages in an extensive succession planning process annually, which includes the involvement of Ameren’s board of directors. We develop our leaders both individually, through job rotations, mentoring and sponsorships, work experiences, and leadership development programs, and as a team. Throughout the year, we offer a variety of forums intended to connect our leaders to our mission, values, strategy and culture, and build leadership skills and capabilities. In addition, we evaluate our organizational structure and make adjustments and expand roles to facilitate execution of our strategy and organizational efficiency.\nTalent\nIn order to attract and retain a skilled and highly qualified workforce, we provide opportunities for employees to expand their knowledge and skill sets, and we support their career development. Our onboarding efforts are designed to ensure early engagement, including the opportunity to participate in mentoring programs. Additionally, employees are encouraged to participate in technical, professional, and leadership development opportunities, and outreach initiatives to engage with the communities that we serve, among other things. As our business needs change, we remain focused on ensuring that our workforce has the tools and skills necessary to deliver on our strategic initiatives.\nOur talent management initiatives include a wide range of recruiting partnerships and programs, designed to engage a variety of career seekers. We have established programs to recruit early and mid-career talent to further enhance our workforce pipelines. These programs include skilled craft education and training for individuals interested in skilled craft roles, an intern/co-op program that serves as a pipeline for STEM-related careers, a program for individuals transitioning from military service, and an early career rotation program.\nWorkforce\nThe majority of our workforce is comprised of skilled-craft and STEM-related professional and technical employees. Our workforce has been stable, with a total attrition rate of 7% in 2024. The majority of employee attrition is attributable to employee retirements, generally allowing for thoughtful workforce and succession planning in advance of these planned transitions. The following table presents our employee count and their average tenure as of December 31, 2024, and the attrition rate in 2024:\nEmployee\nCount\nAverage Tenure \n(in years)\nAttrition\nRate\nAmeren\n8,981\n13\n7%\nAmeren Missouri\n3,830\n14\n6%\nAmeren Illinois\n3,108\n13\n6%\nAmeren Services\n2,043\n11\n10%\n15\nTable\n of Contents\nThe following table presents Ameren’s employees by generation as of December 31, 2024:\nGeneration Description\nAmeren\nAmeren Missouri\nAmeren Illinois\nAmeren Services\nBaby Boomer (birth years between 1946 and 1964)\n11%\n11%\n10%\n11%\nGeneration X (birth years between 1965 and 1980)\n40%\n40%\n40%\n42%\nMillennials (birth years between 1981 and 1996)\n42%\n41%\n43%\n40%\nGeneration Z/Post Millennial (birth years after 1997)\n7%\n8%\n7%\n7%\nCollective bargaining units at Ameren’s subsidiaries consist of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the Laborer’s International Union of North America, the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters, and the United Government Security Officers of America. As of December 31, 2024, these labor unions collectively represented 46%, 59%, 55%, and 10% of the employees at Ameren, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and Ameren Services, respectively. The Ameren Companies expect continued constructive relationships with their respective labor unions. The Ameren Missouri collective bargaining unit contracts expire in 2025 and 2026, and cover 4% and 96% of represented employees, respectively. The Ameren Illinois collective bargaining unit contracts expire in 2026 and 2027, and cover 92% and 8% of represented employees, respectively.\nRewards\nThe primary objective of our rewards program is to provide a total rewards package that attracts and retains a talented workforce and reinforces strong performance in a financially sustainable manner. Management continuously evaluates our core benefits in an effort to create a market-competitive, performance-based, shareholder-aligned total rewards package with a view towards balancing employee value and financial sustainability. We recognize that the rewards package required to attract and retain talent over the long term is about more than pay and benefits; it is about the total employee experience and support of their overall well-being. In addition to base salary, medical benefits, and retirement benefits, including pension for substantially all employees and 401(k) savings, our total rewards package includes short-term incentives and long-term stock-based compensation for certain employees. Further, we offer our employees various programs that encourage overall well-being, including wellness and employee assistance programs. We strive to provide a competitive and sustainable rewards package that supports our ability to attract, engage, and retain a talented and highly qualified workforce, while at the same time reinforcing and rewarding strong performance.\nINDUSTRY ISSUES\nWe are facing issues common to the electric and natural gas utility industry, as well as new and emergent issues impacting the industry as a whole.

  "item7": "ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAmeren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company whose primary assets are its equity interests in its subsidiaries.\n \nAmeren’s subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets, and liabilities. Dividends on Ameren’s common stock and the payment of expenses by Ameren depend on distributions made to it by its subsidiaries.\nBelow is a summary description of Ameren’s principal subsidiaries – Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. Ameren also has other subsidiaries that conduct other activities, such as providing shared services. A more detailed description can be found in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\n•\nAmeren Missouri operates a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission, and distribution business and a rate-regulated natural gas distribution business in Missouri.\n•\nAmeren Illinois operates rate-regulated electric transmission, electric distribution, and natural gas distribution businesses in Illinois.\n•\nATXI operates a FERC rate-regulated electric transmission business in the MISO.\nAmeren has four segments: Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Transmission. The Ameren Missouri segment includes all of the operations of Ameren Missouri. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution consists of the electric distribution business of Ameren Illinois. Ameren Illinois Natural Gas consists of the natural gas business of Ameren Illinois. Ameren Transmission primarily consists of the aggregated electric transmission businesses of Ameren Illinois and ATXI. See Note 16 – Segment Information under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further discussion of Ameren’s and Ameren Illinois’ segments.\nAmeren’s and Ameren Missouri’s financial statements are prepared on a consolidated basis and therefore include the accounts of their majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Ameren Illinois has no subsidiaries. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, unless otherwise indicated.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained in this Form 10-K. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements. The discussion also provides information about the financial results of our business segments to provide a better understanding of how those segments and their results affect the financial condition and results of operations of Ameren as a whole. Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, including comparisons with the year ended December 31, 2023, is included in Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total, we present certain information in cents per share. These amounts reflect factors that directly affect Ameren’s earnings. We believe this per share information helps readers to understand the impact of these factors on Ameren’s earnings per diluted share.\n35\nTable\n of Contents\nOVERVIEW\nOur core strategy is driven by the following three pillars, which allow us to capitalize on opportunities to benefit our customers, communities, shareholders, and the environment:\nInvesting in rate-regulated energy infrastructure\nEnhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible policies\nOptimizing operating performance\nTo capitalize on opportunities to benefit our customers, communities,  shareholders, and the environment\nWe invest in rate-regulated energy infrastructure and seek to earn competitive returns on our investments. We seek to make prudent investments that benefit our customers. The goal of these investments is to maintain and enhance the reliability of our services, develop and deliver cleaner sources of energy, create economic development opportunities in our region, and provide customers with more options and greater control over their energy usage, among other things. By prudently investing in our businesses, we believe that we deliver superior value to both customers and shareholders.\nWe seek to partner with our stakeholders, including our customers, communities, regulators, federal and state legislators, and RTOs, to enhance our regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible energy and economic policies for the benefit of our customers, communities, and shareholders. We believe enhancing our regulatory frameworks is important to drive investment in our business segments, earn competitive returns on those investments, and realize timely recovery of our costs with the benefits accruing to both customers and shareholders.\nUtilizing a continuous improvement mindset, we seek to optimize operating performance for the benefit of our customers. We remain focused on disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation. We align our overall spending, both operating and capital, with economic conditions and with the frameworks established by our regulators. We focus on minimizing the gap between allowed and earned ROEs and allocating capital resources to business opportunities that we expect will provide the most benefit to our customers and offer the most attractive risk-adjusted return potential. \nRate Base ($ in billions)\n(a)\nRegulatory Frameworks\n(c)\nElectric Customer Rates\n(f)\nSegment\nRegulatory Framework\nAmeren\nTransmission\nFormula ratemaking with initial rates based on a future test year\nAllowed ROE of 10.48%\nAmeren Illinois\nElectric\nDistribution\nFuture test year ratemaking under an MYRP\n(d) \nand RBA\nAllowed ROE of 8.72%\n(e)\nAmeren Illinois\nNatural Gas\nFuture test year ratemaking and PGA and VBA\nAllowed ROE of 9.44%\nAmeren\nMissouri\nHistorical test year ratemaking and\nPISA, RESRAM, FAC, MEEIA, PGA\nAllowed ROE is not specified\n(a)\nReflects year-end rate base except for Ameren Transmission, which is average rate base.

Source: Edison Electric Institute, ‘Typical Bills and Average Rates Report’ for the 12 months ended June 30, 2024.\nKey announcements, updates, and regulatory outcomes\nIn September 2023, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri granted Ameren Missouri’s request to modify a September 2019 remedy order issued by the district court in order to allow the retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center in advance of its previously expected retirement date of 2039, in lieu of installing a flue gas desulfurization system. Ameren Missouri retired the Rush Island Energy Center on October 15, 2024. In December 2024, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri issued an order resolving all outstanding claims in this case. The order requires Ameren Missouri to fund a program to provide electric buses and charging stations to schools in the metro St. Louis area and a program to provide air purifiers to eligible Ameren Missouri electric residential customers. These programs are estimated to cost approximately $64 million. As of December 31, 2024, Ameren and Ameren Missouri recorded liabilities of $64 million and charges of $59 million in 2024 related to the cost of these programs.\n36\nTable\n of Contents\nIn June 2024, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the MoPSC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for electric service.\n In February 2025, Ameren Missouri filed an updated electric rate increase request seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for electric service by \n$446 million\n. The electric rate increase request is based on a 10.25% ROE, a capital structure composed of 52% common equity, a rate base of $13.9 billion, and a test year ended March 31, 2024, with certain pro-forma adjustments through the true-up date of December 31, 2024. In February 2025, the MoPSC staff recommended an increase to Ameren Missouri's annual electric service revenues of $384 million based on a 9.74% ROE, a capital structure composed of 52% common equity, and a rate base of $13.9 billion.\n The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed electric service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, with a decision by the MoPSC expected by May 2025 and new rates effective by June 2025.\nIn June 2024, the MoPSC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds by AMF to finance $476 million of costs related to the accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center, which included the remaining unrecovered net plant balance associated with the facility, among other costs. Ameren Missouri will collect the amounts necessary to repay the bonds over approximately 15 years \nfrom the date of bond issuance. The securitized tariff bonds were issued in December 2024.\n The financing order also included a determination that the decision to retire the Rush Island Energy Center was reasonable and prudent. The MoPSC did not make a determination regarding the prudency of Ameren Missouri's prior actions that resulted in the adverse ruling in the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation discussed in Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report, however, claims regarding such actions could be considered in future regulatory proceedings. If future regulatory proceedings result in revenue reductions based on Ameren Missouri’s prior actions that resulted in the adverse ruling in the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren and Ameren Missouri.\nIn 2024, the MoPSC issued orders approving requested CCNs for the Split Rail, Vandalia, Bowling Green, and Cass County solar projects\n. Ameren Missouri acquired the Cass County, Boomtown, and Huck Finn solar projects in June 2024, September 2024, and October 2024, respectively, and placed the assets of the projects, totaling $1 billion, in service in December 2024.\n In October 2024, the MoPSC issued an order approving a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement filed by Ameren Missouri, the MoPSC staff, and other intervenors requesting a CCN for the Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project. The order also includes the use of a post-construction cost deferral related to the project, which allows Ameren Missouri to defer and recover depreciation expense, financing costs, and applicable income taxes incurred from the date the project is placed in service to the date when project costs are reflected in updated base rates as a result of a regulatory rate review. The period of deferral would be limited to the earlier of the time the project costs are reflected in base rates or six months.\nIn September 2024, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the MoPSC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by $40 million. The natural gas rate increase request is based on a 10.25% ROE, a capital structure composed of 52% common equity, a rate base of $531 million, and a test year ended March 31, 2024, with certain pro-forma adjustments expected through the true-up date of December 31, 2024. The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, with a decision by the MoPSC expected by August 2025 and new rates effective by September 2025.\nIn November 2024, the MoPSC issued an order approving a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement for Ameren Missouri’s MEEIA 2025 plan, which includes a portfolio of customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs, along with the continued use of the MEEIA rider, which allows Ameren Missouri to collect from customers its actual MEEIA program costs, related lost electric revenues, and performance incentives. Ameren Missouri intends to invest $51 million annually in 2025 and 2026 and $22 million in 2027 for customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs. In addition, the order approved performance incentives applicable to each plan year to earn revenues by achieving certain spending and demand response goals. If 100% of the goals are achieved in 2025, 2026, and 2027, Ameren Missouri would earn performance incentive revenues of $5 million, $5 million, and $2 million, respectively.\nIn February 2025, Ameren Missouri filed an update to its Smart Energy Plan with the MoPSC, which includes a five-year capital investment overview with a detailed one-year plan for 2025. The plan is designed to upgrade Ameren Missouri’s electric infrastructure and includes investments that will upgrade the grid and accommodate more renewable energy. Investments under the plan are expected to total approximately $16.2 billion over the five-year period from 2025 through 2029, with expenditures largely recoverable under the PISA. Ameren Missouri’s Smart Energy Plan includes approximately $1 billion in capital expenditures that may be necessary to comply with regulations issued by the EPA in 2024 relating to CO\n2\n emissions and MATS, if such regulations are not revised or overturned. See Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for additional information on the EPA regulations. The Smart Energy Plan excludes investments in its natural gas distribution business, as well as removal costs, net of salvage.\nIn November 2023, the ICC issued an order in Ameren Illinois’ January 2023 natural gas delivery service regulatory rate review, which resulted in an increase to its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service of $112 million based on a 9.44% allowed ROE, a capital structure composed of 50% common equity, and a rate base of approximately $2.85 billion. The order reflected a reduction of approximately $93 million of planned distribution and transmission capital investments included in Ameren Illinois’ requested revenue increase, which used a 2024 future test year. The new rates became effective on November 28, 2023. In December 2023, Ameren Illinois filed a request for rehearing of the ICC's November 2023 order. The filing requested the ICC revise the order to include an allowed ROE of at least 9.89%, a capital structure composed of 52% common equity, and a reversal of the approximately $93 million reduction of planned distribution and \n37\nTable\n of Contents\ntransmission capital investments included in the order, among other things. \nIn January 2024, the ICC denied Ameren Illinois’ rehearing request, and Ameren Illinois filed an appeal with the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District. In January 2025, the appellate court ruled on the appeal filed by Ameren Illinois. In that ruling, the court reversed a reduction of planned transmission capital investments of $48 million, but affirmed the ICC-approved 9.44% ROE and the remaining reduction of planned distribution capital investments.\n Ameren Illinois took prudent steps to align its operations with the ICC order, while continuing to ensure safe and adequate service is maintained.\nIn December 2023, the ICC issued an order in Ameren Illinois' MYRP proceeding approving base rates for electric distribution services for 2024 through 2027 and rejecting Ameren Illinois' Grid Plan, which was addressed as part of the MYRP proceeding. Rate changes consistent with the December 2023 order became effective in January 2024 and remained effective through late June 2024, when new rates became effective pursuant to the June 2024 ICC rehearing order discussed below. The December 2023 order adopted an alternative methodology to establish a rate base and revenue requirements for the years 2024 through 2027 using Ameren Illinois’ previously approved 2022 year-end rate base. In January 2024, the ICC partially denied a rehearing requested by Ameren Illinois to revise the allowed ROE in the December 2023 order and granted Ameren Illinois’ rehearing request to reconsider the rate base for each year of the MYRP and to include a base level of investments to maintain grid reliability in each year of the MYRP. In June 2024, the ICC issued an order on Ameren Illinois’ rehearing request approving revenue requirements for electric distribution services for 2024 through 2027. New rates became effective in late June 2024 and remained effective through late December 2024, when new rates became effective pursuant to the December 2024 ICC order discussed below. In July 2024, Ameren Illinois filed a request for rehearing of the ICC’s June 2024 rehearing order to include an asset associated with other postretirement benefits in the rate base. Subsequently, in August 2024, the ICC denied the rehearing request. Also, in January 2024, Ameren Illinois filed an appeal of the December 2023 ICC order, including the 8.72% ROE, and subsequently updated the appeal filing in September 2024 to include the June 2024 rehearing order regarding the inclusion of an asset associated with other postretirement benefits in the rate base to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District. The court is under no deadline to address the appeal and Ameren Illinois cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the appeal. \nIn March 2024, pursuant to the December 2023 ICC order discussed above, Ameren Illinois filed a revised Grid Plan and a revised MYRP to update the requested revenue requirements for 2024 through 2027. In December 2024, the ICC issued an order in connection with Ameren Illinois’ revised Grid Plan and revised MYRP, approving revenue requirements for electric distribution services for 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027 of $1,206 million, $1,287 million, $1,367 million, and $1,422 million, respectively. Rate changes consistent with the December 2024 order became effective in December 2024. In January 2025, Ameren Illinois filed a request for rehearing of the ICC’s December 2024 order to revise the allowed ROE and to include an asset associated with other postretirement benefits in the rate base, among other things. Subsequently, in February 2025, the ICC denied the rehearing request. Ameren Illinois intends to file an appeal of the ICC’s December 2024 order and update the appeal filed in September 2024 to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District as discussed above. In 20\n24, Ameren Illinois took prudent steps to align its operations with the December 2023 and June 2024 ICC orders, while continuing to ensure safe and adequate service was maintained.\nIn November 2024, the ICC issued an order in Ameren Illinois’ annual update filing that approved electric customer energy-efficiency rates of $126 million beginning in January 2025, which represents an increase of $26 million from 2024 rates. This order was based on a projected 2025 year-end rate base of $434 million.\nIn December 2024, the ICC issued an order approving Ameren Illinois’ 2023 electric distribution service revenue requirement reconciliation adjustment filing. This order approved a reconciliation adjustment of $158 million, which reflected Ameren Illinois’ actual 2023 recoverable costs, year-end rate base of $4.2 billion, and capital structure composed of 50% common equity. The approved reconciliation adjustment will be collected from customers in 2025.\nIn January 2025, Ameren Illinois filed a request with the ICC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by $140 million. The request is based on a 10.7% ROE, a capital structure composed of 52% common equity, and a rate base of $3.3 \n38\nTable\n of Contents\nbillion. Ameren Illinois used a 2026 future test year in this proceeding. A decision by the ICC in this proceeding is required by early December 2025, with new rates expected to be effective in December 2025.\nIn 2021, the MISO issued a report outlining a preliminary long-range transmission planning roadmap of projects through 2039, which considers the rapidly changing generation mix within MISO resulting from significant additions of renewable generation, actual and expected generation plant closures, and state mandates or goals for clean energy or carbon emissions reductions. In 2022, the MISO approved the first tranche of projects under the roadmap. A portion of these projects were assigned to various utilities, of which Ameren was awarded projects that are estimated to cost approximately $1.8 billion, based on the MISO’s cost estimate. Related to these projects, Ameren began substation upgrades in May 2024 in advance of transmission line construction, which is expected to begin in 2026, with forecasted completion dates near the end of this decade. \nIn addition, the MISO awarded three competitive bid projects to ATXI that represent a total estimated investment of approximately $220 million for ATXI.\n \nIn February 2024, Ameren Illinois and ATXI filed a request for a CCN, among other things, with the ICC related to the portion of the MISO long-range transmission projects they will construct within the ICC’s jurisdiction.\n A decision by the ICC is expected by mid-2025. In 2024, ATXI filed requests for CCNs, among other things, with the MoPSC related to the MISO long-range transmission projects that it expects to construct within the MoPSC’s jurisdiction. Decisions by the MoPSC are expected in 2025. Also in December 2024, the MISO approved a first set of second tranche projects. A portion of these projects were assigned to Ameren and are estimated to cost approximately $1.3 billion, based on the MISO’s cost estimate. The first set of second tranche projects also includes competitive bid projects that are estimated to cost $6.5 billion, which includes projects located in Illinois that are estimated to cost $1.8 billion, based on the MISO’s cost estimate. The competitive bid process is expected to take place through 2026. The MISO is assessing future long-range transmission scenarios in the first quarter of 2025 and development of a second set of second tranche projects will follow this assessment.\nIn October 2024, the FERC issued an order, which decreased the allowed base ROE for FERC-regulated transmission rate base under the MISO tariff from 10.02% to 9.98% and required refunds, with interest, for the periods from November 2013 to February 2015 and from late September 2016 forward. \nIn November 2024, the MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI, filed a request for rehearing with the FERC, arguing, among other things, the FERC should not have ordered refunds back to September 2016 or imposed interest on those refunds. Also in November 2024, another intervenor filed a request for rehearing with the FERC, requesting the FERC correct aspects of the ROE methodology used in the October 2024 order and reconsider its decision in a February 2015 complaint case to deny refunds for the period from February 2015 to May 2016. In December 2024, the FERC issued a notice indicating a future order related to the rehearing requests will be issued but did not specify a timeline. In January 2025, the MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI, filed an appeal of the October 2024 order to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n As a result of the October 2024 order, Ameren and Ameren Illinois recognized reductions to electric revenues of $10 million and $7 million, respectively, and recognized interest expense of $2 million and $1 million, respectively, on their statements of income in 2024.\nIn February 2024, Ameren’s board of directors increased the quarterly common stock dividend to 67 cents per share, resulting in an annualized equivalent dividend rate of $2.68 per share. In February 2025, Ameren’s board of directors increased the quarterly common stock dividend to 71 cents per share, resulting in an annualized equivalent dividend rate of $2.84 per share.\nFor further information on the matters discussed above, see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report, and the Outlook section below.\n39\nTable\n of Contents\nEarnings\nNet income attributable to Ameren common shareholders was $1,182 million, or $4.42 per diluted share, for 2024, and $1,152 million, or $4.38 per diluted share, for 2023. Net income was favorably affected in 2024, compared with 2023, by increased infrastructure investments at Ameren Transmission and Ameren Missouri. Net income was also favorably affected in 2024, compared with 2023, by increased base rate revenues pursuant to the MoPSC's June 2023 electric rate order as well as higher base rate revenues pursuant to the ICC's November 2023 natural gas rate order, which increased earnings at Ameren Illinois Natural Gas. Additionally, earnings in 2024, compared with 2023, were favorably affected by decreased other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to formula rates, riders, or trackers, largely because of lower energy center maintenance costs, lower storm costs, disciplined cost management including lower labor costs from decreased headcount and decreased use of contractors, and lower amortization of refueling costs for the Callaway Energy Center, partially offset by the absence of the regulatory deferrals associated with the June 2023 MoPSC rate order. Net income in 2024, compared with 2023, was also favorably affected by increased retail electric sales volumes at Ameren Missouri, primarily due to higher sales excluding customer energy-efficiency programs. Net income was unfavorably affected in 2024, compared with 2023, by two charges related to matters that originated over a decade ago. The first of these charges was recorded by Ameren Missouri \nrelated to an order from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, which resolved all outstanding claims in the NSR and Clean Air Ac\nt litigation related to the Rush Island Energy Center. The second charge was recognized by Ameren Illinois and ATXI for the decrease in the allowed base ROE under the MISO tariff resulting from the October 2024 FERC order, which included customer refunds for certain historical periods. Net income in 2024, compared with 2023, was also unfavorably affected by increased financing costs due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates at Ameren Missouri and Ameren (parent), a lower recognized ROE under the MYRP, and an increase in the weighted-average basic common shares outstanding, which reduced earnings per diluted share.\nLiquidity\nAt December 31, 2024, Ameren, on a consolidated basis, had available liquidity in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under the Credit Agreements of $1.4 billion.\nAmeren has an ATM program under which Ameren may offer and sell from time to time common stock, which includes the ability to enter into forward sale agreements, subject to market conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2024, Ameren had approximately $550 million of common stock available for sale under the ATM program, which takes into account the forward sale agreements in effect as of December 31, 2024. For information regarding long-term debt issuances and maturities, common stock issuances, and outstanding forward sale agreements entered into under the ATM program through the date of this report, see Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\n40\nTable\n of Contents\nAmeren remains focused on strategic capital allocation. The following chart presents 2024 capital expenditures by segment and the midpoint of projected cumulative capital expenditures for 2025 through 2029 by segment:\n2024 Capital Expenditures by Segment \n(Total Ameren – $4.3 billion)\n(in billions)\nMidpoint of 2025 – 2029 Projected Capital \nExpenditures by Segment (Total Ameren – $26.3 billion)\n(in billions)\nAmeren Missouri\n(a)\nAmeren Illinois Natural Gas\nAmeren Illinois Electric Distribution\nAmeren Transmission\n(b)\nFor 2025 through 2029, Ameren’s cumulative capital expenditures are projected to range from $25.2 billion to $27.4 billion.

Economic conditions, energy-efficiency investments by our customers and by us, technological advances, distributed generation, and the actions of key customers can significantly affect the demand for our services. Ameren and Ameren Missouri results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations in winter heating and summer cooling demands and by weather conditions, such as storms, as well as by energy center maintenance outages. Additionally, fluctuations in interest rates and conditions in the capital and credit markets affect our cost of borrowing, our pension and postretirement benefits costs, the cash surrender value of COLI, and the asset value of Ameren Missouri’s nuclear decommissioning trust fund. Almost all of Ameren’s revenues are subject to state or federal regulation. This regulation has a material impact on the rates we charge customers for our services. Our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity are affected by our ability to align our overall spending, both operating and capital, with the frameworks established by our regulators. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information regarding Ameren Missouri’s, Ameren Illinois’, and ATXI’s regulatory frameworks.\nAmeren Missouri principally uses coal and enriched uranium for fuel in its electric operations and purchases natural gas for its customers. Ameren Illinois purchases power and natural gas for its customers. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly because of the global economic and political environment, weather, supply, demand, inflation, and many other factors. We have natural gas \n41\nTable\n of Contents\ncost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois and Missouri natural gas distribution businesses, a purchased power cost recovery mechanism for Ameren Illinois’ electric distribution business, and a FAC for Ameren Missouri’s electric business.\nWe employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risk and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of Ameren Missouri’s energy centers and our transmission and distribution systems and the level and timing of operations and maintenance costs and capital investment are key factors that we seek to manage in order to optimize our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nEarnings Summary\nThe following table presents a summary of Ameren’s earnings for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n2024\n2023\nNet income attributable to Ameren common shareholders\n$\n1,182\n \n$\n1,152 \nEarnings per common share – diluted\n4.42\n \n4.38 \nNet income attributable to Ameren common shareholders in 2024 increased $30 million, and $0.04 per diluted share, from 2023. The increase was due to net income increases of $27 million, $15 million, and $14 million at Ameren Transmission, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, and Ameren Missouri, respectively. The increases in net income were partially offset by a net income decrease of $24 million at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution and an increase in the net loss for activity not reported as part of a segment, primarily at Ameren (parent), of $2 million.\nEarnings per share in 2024, compared with 2023, were favorably affected by:\n•\nincreased allowance for equity funds used during construction and increased base rate revenues for the inclusion of previously deferred PISA and RESRAM interest charges pursuant to the June 2023 MoPSC electric rate order effective July 9, 2023, and decreased interest charges resulting from higher deferrals related to infrastructure investments associated with the PISA and RESRAM, at Ameren Missouri (17 cents per share);\n•\nincreased rate base investments at Ameren Transmission, which increased earnings in this segment (16 cents per share);\n•\nincreased base rate revenues at Ameren Missouri effective July 9, 2023, pursuant to the June 2023 MoPSC electric rate order, partially offset by the net effect of amortization of previously deferred depreciation expense under the PISA and RESRAM, financing costs otherwise recoverable under the PISA and RESRAM, a lower base level of expenses included in trackers, and the net recovery for amounts associated with the reduction in sales volumes resulting from MEEIA programs (9 cents per share);\n•\nincreased retail electric sales volumes at Ameren Missouri, primarily due to higher sales excluding customer energy-efficiency programs (estimated at 8 cents per share);\n•\nincreased other income, net, primarily due to lower donations and a gain on the extinguishment of debt, see Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for more information, partially offset by decreased non-service cost components of net periodic benefit income not subject to formula rates or trackers largely due to lower investment returns (6 cents per share);\n•\nincreased base rate revenues at Ameren Illinois Natural Gas effective November 28, 2023, pursuant to the November 2023 ICC natural gas rate order, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses included in base rates (4 cents per share); and\n•\ndecreased other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to formula rates, riders, or trackers, excluding a charge related to the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation discussed below largely because of lower energy center maintenance costs, lower storm costs, disciplined cost management including lower labor costs from decreased headcount and decreased use of contractors, and lower amortization of refueling costs for the Callaway Energy Center, partially offset by the absence of regulatory deferrals associated with the June 2023 MoPSC rate order (2 cents per share).\nEarnings per share in 2024, compared with 2023, were unfavorably affected by:\n•\na charge recorded by Ameren Missouri, included in other operation and maintenance expenses, \nrelated to an order from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, which resolved all outstanding claims in the NSR and Clean Air Ac\nt litigation related to the Rush Island Energy Center, see Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for more information (17 cents per share);\n•\nincreased financing costs primarily at Ameren Missouri and Ameren (parent), largely due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates, partially offset by lower levels of short-term borrowings (17 cents per share);\n•\nlower revenue at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution due to a lower recognized ROE under the MYRP (9 cents per share);\n•\nincreased weighted-average basic common shares outstanding resulting from issuances of common shares (7 cents per share);\n•\nthe result of the October 2024 FERC order reducing the allowed base ROE for FERC regulated transmission rate base under the MISO tariff, which decreased Ameren Transmission earnings (4 cents per share); and\n42\nTable\n of Contents\n•\nincreased taxes other than income taxes at Ameren Missouri, largely resulting from the absence in 2024 of employee retention tax credits received under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (2 cents per share).\nThe cents per share variances above are presented based on the weighted-average basic shares outstanding in 2023 and do not reflect the impact of dilution on earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. The amounts above other than variances related to income taxes have been presented net of income taxes using Ameren’s 2024 blended federal and state statutory tax rate of 26%.

Revenues were favorably affected by higher recoverable expenses (+$55 million), increased capital investment (+$44 million), as evidenced by a 15% increase in rate base used to calculate the revenue requirement, and increased facility rental revenues (+$15 million) related to ATXI’s transmission operations control center, which was placed in service in December 2023. ATXI provides affiliates with access to this facility. Rental revenues associated with this facility are affiliate transactions and eliminated in consolidation for Ameren’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 – Related-party Transactions under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information. Revenues were unfavorably affected by a decrease in the allowed base ROE under the MISO tariff resulting from the October 2024 FERC order, which included customer refunds for certain historical periods (-$10 million). See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information regarding the FERC complaint cases.\nAmeren Missouri\nAmeren Missouri’s electric revenues\n increased\n \n$153 million\n, or \n4%\n, in \n2024, compared with 2023.\nThe following items had a favorable effect on Ameren Missouri’s electric revenues in 2024, compared with 2023:\n•\n“Off-system sales, capacity, transmission, and FAC revenues, net” increased $96 million, primarily due to higher summer and fall capacity prices which were set by annual MISO auctions.\n•\nHigher electric base rates, resulting from the June 2023 MoPSC electric rate order effective July 9, 2023, increased revenues an estimated \n$62 million\n.\n•\nExcluding the estimated effects of weather and the MEEIA customer energy-efficiency programs, electric revenues increased an estimated \n$27 million\n, due to an increase in residential customer counts, retail sales volumes from large commercial and industrial customers, the absence of customer outages resulting from major storms experienced throughout the service territory in July and August 2023, and an additional day in 2024 as a result of the leap year. The increase is partially offset by lower realized prices due to changes in customer usage patterns and economic development discounts.\n•\nRevenues associated with other cost recovery mechanisms increased\n \n$22 million\n, \nprimarily due to an increase in RESRAM revenues and an increase in excise taxes due to increased retail sales revenue.\n•\nOther revenues increased $6 million due to pole rents (+$2 million), other rentals (+$2 million), and other miscellaneous revenues \n(+$2 million).\n•\nThe aggregate effect of weather increased revenues an estimated $3 million as cooling degree days increased 7% and heating degree days decreased 4%.\nThe following ite\nms had an unfavorable effect on Ameren Missouri’s electric revenues in 2024, compared with 2023:\n•\nRevenues associated with “Cost recovery mechanisms – offset in fuel and purchased power” decreased $54 million, due to decreased revenue related to the amortization of costs previously deferred under the FAC that were reflected in customer rates. The changes to “Cost recovery mechanisms - offset in fuel and purchased power” are fully offset by changes to “Cost recovery mechanisms - offset in electric revenue” in fuel and purchased power.\n•\nIn accordance with the June 2024 MoPSC financing order, revenues decreased $13 million due to the deferral of base rate revenues to a regulatory liability related to the Rush Island Energy Center since its October 15, 2024 retirement date. The regulatory liability will be refunded to customers in a future rate proceeding.\nAmeren Illinois\nAmeren Illinois’ electric revenues decreased $51 million, or 2%,\n in \n2024, compared with 2023, driven by decreased revenues at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, partially offset by increased revenues at Ameren Illinois Transmission.\nAmeren Illinois Electric Distribution\nAmeren Illinois Electric Distribution’s revenues decreased $129 million, or 6%, in 2024, compared with 2023.\n47\nTable\n of Contents\nThe following items had an unfavorable effect on Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution’s revenues in 2024, compared with 2023:\n•\nRevenues associated with “Cost recovery mechanisms – offset in fuel and purchased power” decreased $193 million, due to decreased purchased power expenses recovered from customers. The decreases in electric revenues are fully offset by decreases in purchased power expenses under cost recovery mechanisms for purchased power, as discussed below.\n•\nPursuant to an ICC order, revenues decreased $23 million, due to an increase in the amortization rate for certain excess deferred income taxes.\nThe following items had a favorable effect on Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution’s revenues in 2024, compared with 2023:\n•\nOther cost recovery mechanisms increased revenues by $45 million, primarily due to a higher amount of bad debt and purchased receivables from alternative retail electric suppliers included in customer rates pursuant to their associated riders, partially offset by lower environmental remediation revenues.\n•\nRevenues associated with customer energy-efficiency program investments increased $21 million, due to the recovery of program expenses (+$15 million), an increase in the ROE (+$4 million) primarily due to maximum achievement of the annual 2023 energy savings goals, and increased investment of $2 million.\n•\nBase rates increased revenues by $14 million, primarily due to higher recoverable non-purchased power expenses (+$38 million), partially offset by a lower recognized ROE (-$24 million). The MYRP utilizes a fixed ROE approved by the ICC of 8.72%, with adjustments for any performance incentives and penalties, while the IEIMA formula-based ROE was based on the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points (9.84% as of December 31, 2023).\n•\nThe recovery of labor and benefit costs for crews assisting other utilities with power restoration efforts, primarily caused by hurricane damage, increased revenues by $3 million.\nAmeren Illinois Transmission\nAmeren Illinois Transmission’s revenues increased \n$84 million\n, \nor 18%\n, \nin 2024, compared with 2023.\n Base rate revenues were favorably affected by higher recoverable expen\nses (+$58 million) and increased capital investment (+$33 million), as e\nvidenced by a 17% increase in rate base used to calculate the revenue requirement\n. Base rate revenues were unfavorably affected by a decrease in the allowed base ROE under the MISO tariff resulting from the October 2024 FERC order, which included customer refunds for certain historical periods (-$7 million). See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information regarding the FERC ROE complaint cases.\nNatural Gas Revenues\nAmeren\nAmeren’s natural gas revenues increased \n$22 million\n, or \n2%\n, \nin 2024, compared with 2023, due to increased revenues at Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, partially offset by decreased revenues at Ameren Missouri, as discussed below.\nAmeren Missouri\nAmeren Missouri’s natural gas revenues decreased $19 million, or 12%, in 2024, compared with 2023. Revenues associated with “Cost recovery mechanisms – offset in natural gas purchased for resale” decreased $20 million in 2024, compared with 2023, due to lower commodity prices and the absence of amortization of natural gas costs deferred under the PGA related to the extremely cold weather in mid-February 2021. Changes in natural gas revenues under the PGA are fully offset by corresponding changes in natural gas purchased for resale expenses.\nAmeren Illinois Natural Gas\nAmeren Illinois Natural Gas’ revenues increased $41 million, or 5%, in 2024, compared with 2023. Revenues increased an estimated $47 million due to higher natural gas base rates as a result of the November 2023 natural gas rate order, and revenues associated with other cost recovery mechanisms increased $7 million primarily due to increased revenues for excise taxes. “Cost recovery mechanisms – offset in natural gas purchased for resale” decreased revenues $16 million, due to lower collection of natural gas costs previously deferred under the PGA.\n Changes in\n natural gas revenues under the PGA are fully offset by the decrease in natural gas purchased for resale expenses.\n48\nTable\n of Contents\nFuel and Purchased Power\nThe following table presents the increases (decreases) by Ameren segment for fuel and purchased power in 2024, compared with 2023:\n2024 versus 2023\nAmeren Missouri\nAmeren Illinois\nElectric Distribution\nAmeren Illinois\nNatural Gas\nAmeren Transmission\nOther /Intersegment Eliminations\nAmeren\nFuel and purchased power change:\nEnergy costs (excluding the estimated effect of weather)\n$\n95 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n95 \nEffect of higher net energy costs included in base rates\n22 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n22 \nRetail sales volumes\n6 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n6 \nTransmission service charges\n8 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n8 \nOther\n(3)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n(3)\nCost recovery mechanisms – offset in electric revenue\n(a)\n(54)\n(193)\n— \n— \n(12)\n(259)\nTotal fuel and purchased power change\n$\n74 \n$\n(193)\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n(12)\n$\n(131)\n(a)\n“Cost recovery mechanisms — offset in electric revenue” changes are offset by corresponding changes in “Cost recovery mechanisms — offset in fuel and purchased power” in electric revenues. Activity in Other/Intersegment Eliminations of $12 million represents the changes in eliminations of related-party transactions between Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI (-$6 million), as well as changes in Ameren Transmission revenue from transmission services provided to Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution (-$6 million). See Note 13 – Related-party Transactions and Note 16 – Segment Information under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on intersegment eliminations. These items have no overall impact on earnings.\nAmeren\nAmeren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are generally allowed to pass on to customers prudently incurred costs for fuel and purchased power. Ameren’s electric fuel and purchased power expenses decreased $131 million, or 7%, in 2024, compared with 2023, primarily due to decreased fuel and purchased power expenses at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, partially offset by increased fuel and purchased power expenses at Ameren Missouri, as discussed below.\nAmeren Missouri\nAmeren Missouri’s fuel and purchased power expenses increased $74 million, or 7%, in 2024, compared with 2023.\nThe following items increased Ameren Missouri’s fuel and purchased power expense in 2024, compared with 2023:\n•\nEnergy costs increased $95 million in 2024, compared with 2023, primarily due to higher summer and fall capacity prices, which were set by annual MISO auctions. Ameren Missouri’s 5% exposure to net energy cost variances under the FAC is the difference between “Off-system sales, capacity, transmission, and FAC revenues, net” and “Energy costs (excluding the estimated effect of weather)”. These results had an immaterial impact on earnings in 2024, compared with 2023.\n•\nThe effect of higher net energy costs included in base rates increased Ameren Missouri’s fuel and purchased power expenses $22 million in 2024, compared with 2023, as a result of the June 2023 MoPSC electric rate order.\n•\nTransmission service charges increased $8 million\n \ndue to higher transmission rates related to increased revenue requirements of other transmission operators.\n•\nIncreases in retail sales volumes increased Ameren Missouri’s fuel and purchased power expenses $6 million.\n“Cost recovery mechanisms — offset in electric revenue” decreased $54 million in 2024, compared with 2023, due to decreased amortization of costs previously deferred under the FAC. The changes to “Cost recovery mechanisms - offset in electric revenue” are fully offset by “Cost recovery mechanisms - offset in fuel and purchased power” in electric revenues.\nAmeren Illinois Electric Distribution\nAmeren Illinois Electric Distribution’s purchased power expenses decreased $193 million, or 21%, in 2024, compared with 2023, primarily due to decreased energy prices (-$94 million), which largely reflect the results of IPA procurement events, decreased capacity prices (-$77 million), which were set by annual MISO auctions, and lower volumes (-$43 million) primarily due to residential and small commercial customers switching from Ameren Illinois’ supplied power to alternative retail electric suppliers and customer adoption of solar technology through initiatives required under Illinois law. These decreases in purchased power expenses were partially offset by increased expenses associated with the amortization of renewable energy credit costs (+$20 million). The changes to “Cost recovery mechanisms - offset in electric revenue” are fully offset by changes to “Cost recovery mechanisms - offset in fuel and purchased power” in electric revenues.\n49\nTable\n of Contents\nNatural Gas Purchased for Resale\nThe following table presents the increases (decreases) by Ameren segment for natural gas purchased for resale in 2024, compared with 2023:\n2024 versus 2023\nAmeren Missouri\nAmeren Illinois\nElectric Distribution\nAmeren Illinois\nNatural Gas\nAmeren Transmission\nOther /Intersegment Eliminations\nAmeren\nNatural gas purchased for resale change:\nEffect of weather (estimate)\n(a)\n$\n1 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n1 \nCost recovery mechanisms – offset in natural gas revenue\n(b)\n(20)\n— \n(16)\n— \n— \n(36)\nTotal natural gas purchased for resale change\n$\n(19)\n$\n— \n$\n(16)\n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n(35)\n(a)\nRepresents the estimated variation resulting primarily from changes in heating degree-days on natural gas demand compared with the prior year; this variation is based on temperature readings from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather stations at local airports in our service territories.\n(b)\nNatural gas purchased for resale changes are offset by corresponding changes in “Natural gas revenues” on the statement of income. These items have no overall impact on earnings.\nAmeren\nAmeren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are allowed to pass on to customers prudently incurred costs for natural gas purchased for resale. Ameren’s natural gas purchased for resale expenses decreased $35 million, or 10%, in 2024, compared with 2023, due to decreased natural gas purchased for resale expenses at Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, as discussed below.\nAmeren Missouri\nAmeren Missouri’s natural gas purchased for resale expenses decreased $19 million, or 24%, in 2024, compared with 2023. Expenses associated with “Cost recovery mechanisms – offset in natural gas revenue” decreased $20 million in 2024, compared with 2023, due to \nlower commodity prices and the absence of amortization of natural gas costs deferred under the PGA related to the extremely cold weather in mid-February 2\n021. Changes in natural gas purchased for resale expenses are fully offset by corresponding changes in natural gas revenues under the PGA.\nAmeren Illinois Natural Gas\nAmeren Illinois Natural Gas’ natural gas purchased for resale expenses decreased $16 million, or 6%, in 2024, compared with 2023, primarily due to lower amortization of natural gas costs that were previously deferred under the PGA and lower natural gas prices.

In addition to changes discussed below, other income, net, increased $14 million for activity not reported as part of a segment, primarily due to lower charitable contributions of $18 million at Ameren (parent) and a gain of $16 million for Ameren (parent)’s repurchase of senior secured notes and first mortgage bonds issued by Ameren Missouri and first mortgage bonds issued by Ameren Illinois. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $13 million due to the non-service cost component of net periodic benefit income for activity not reported as part of a segment and $7 million in intersegment eliminations.\nAmeren Transmission\nOther income, net, decreased $2 million in 2024, compared with 2023 due to a decrease of $5 million in lower allowance for equity funds used during construction, primarily related to lower average construction work in progress balances and a decrease of $2 million in the non-service cost component of net periodic benefit income. These decreases were partially offset by the increase of $4 million in other interest income on regulatory balances.\nAmeren Missouri\nOther income, net, increased $66 million in 2024, compared with 2023, primarily because of an increase of $42 million in the non-service cost component of net periodic benefit income because of changes in the base level of pension and postretirement costs pursuant to the June 2023 MoPSC electric rate order. Other income, net, also increased $28 million because of a higher allowance for equity funds used during construction resulting from higher average construction work in progress balances. These increases were offset by a decrease of $2 million in other interest income on regulatory balances.\nAmeren Illinois\n55\nTable\n of Contents\nOther income, net, decreased $9 million in 2024, compared with 2023.

In addition to changes by segments discussed below, interest charges increased $42 million for activity not reported as part of a segment, primarily at Ameren (parent), because of issuances of long-term debt in November and December of 2023, which collectively increased interest charges by $64 million. The net proceeds from these issuances were used to repay short-term borrowings, which decreased short-term interest expense by $23 million, compared with 2023.\nAmeren Transmission\nInterest charges increased $21 million in 2024, compared with 2023, primarily due to issuances of long-term debt in May 2023, June 2024 and August 2024, which collectively increased interest charges by $9 million. Additionally, an increase on long-term debt and a higher interest rate on an increased level of short-term borrowings increased interest charges by $8 million and $2 million, respectively.\nAmeren Missouri\nInterest charges increased $17 million in 2024, compared with 2023, primarily due to issuances of long-term debt in March 2023, January 2024, April 2024, and October 2024, which collectively increased interest charges by $48 million.\n56\nTable\n of Contents\nThe following items partially offset the above increase in interest charges between years:\n•\nIncrease in the borrowed funds capitalized as part of the allowance for funds used during construction of $12 million, primarily due to higher average construction work in progress balances.\n•\nInterest charges decreased by $9 million due to the maturity of $350 million senior secured notes bearing a 3.5% interest rate in April 2024 that were repaid with cash on hand.\n•\nInterest charges reflected a deferral to a regulatory asset of interest associated with investments in eligible property, plant, and equipment not yet included in base rates, pursuant to PISA and RESRAM. Base rates were updated to include the eligible property, plant, and equipment in-service through December 31, 2022, when new customer rates became effective on July 9, 2023, pursuant to the June 2023 MoPSC electric rate order. This update to base rates resulted in a higher deferral of interest in 2024 pursuant to PISA and RESRAM that decreased interest charges by $5 million.\n•\nLower levels of short-term borrowings decreased interest charges by $4 million.\nAmeren Illinois\nInterest charges increased $37 million in 2024, compared with 2023, primarily due to the following:\nAmeren Illinois Transmission\nInterest charges increased by $20 million, primarily due to issuances of long-term debt in May 2023 and June 2024, which increased interest charges by $10 million. Additionally, an increase of interest on long-term debt, a higher interest rate on an increased level of short-term borrowings, and interest charges resulting from the October 2024 FERC ROE order increased interest charges by $4 million, $2 million, and $2 million, respectively.\nAmeren Illinois Electric Distribution\nInterest charges increased by $9 million, primarily due to issuances of long-term debt in May 2023 and June 2024, which increased interest charges by $11 million.\nAmeren Illinois Natural Gas\nInterest charges increased by $8 million, primarily due to issuances of long-term debt in May 2023 and June 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table presents effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024\n \nand 2023:\n2024\n2023\nAmeren\n7%\n14%\nAmeren Missouri\n(18)%\n(2)%\nAmeren Illinois\n24%\n26%\nAmeren Illinois Electric Distribution\n18%\n24%\nAmeren Illinois Natural Gas\n27%\n27%\nAmeren Illinois Transmission\n27%\n26%\nAmeren Transmission\n27%\n26%\nSee Note 12 – Income Taxes under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information regarding reconciliations of effective income tax rates for Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois.\nThe effective tax rate was lower at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution in 2024, compared with 2023, primarily due to an increase in excess deferred tax amortization pursuant to an ICC order, which was offset by a corresponding decrease in revenues.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCollections from our tariff-based revenues are our principal source of cash provided by operating activities. A diversified retail customer mix, primarily consisting of rate-regulated residential, commercial, and industrial customers, provides us with a reasonably predictable source of cash. In addition to using cash provided by operating activities, we use available cash, drawings under committed credit agreements, commercial paper issuances, and/or, in the case of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, short-term affiliate borrowings to support normal operations and temporary capital requirements. We may reduce our short-term borrowings with cash provided by operations or, at our discretion, with long-term borrowings, or, in the case of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, with capital contributions from Ameren (parent). In addition, to support a portion of its fuel requirements for generation, Ameren Missouri has entered into various long-term commitments to \n57\nTable\n of Contents\nmeet these requirements. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois also have entered into various long-term commitments for purchased power and natural gas for distribution. Ameren’s, Ameren Missouri’s, and Ameren Illinois’ estimated minimum purchase obligations associated with these commitments totaled $2.1 billion, $1.0 billion, and, $1.1 billion, respectively, which include $0.8 billion, $0.3 billion, and, $0.5 billion, respectively, in 2025. Further, for additional information about Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s obligations associated wtih operating leases, see Note 15 – Supplemental Information.\nWe expect to make significant capital expenditures over the next five years, as discussed in the Capital Expenditures sections below, supported by a combination of long-term debt and equity, as we invest in our electric and natural gas utility infrastructure to support overall system reliability, grid modernization, renewable energy target requirements, environmental compliance, and other improvements. For additional information about our long-term debt outstanding, including maturities due within one year, and the applicable interest rates, see Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report. As part of its funding plan for capital expenditures, Ameren is using newly issued shares of common stock to satisfy requirements under the DRPlus and employee benefit plans and expects to continue to do so through at least 2029. Additionally, Ameren has an ATM program under which Ameren may offer and sell from time to time common stock, which includes the ability to enter into forward sale agreements, subject to market conditions and other factors. During 2024, Ameren issued a total of 2.9 million shares of common stock and received aggregate proceeds of $233 million under the ATM program. As of December 31, 2024, Ameren had multiple forward sale agreements that could be settled under the ATM program with various counterparties relating to 2.5 million shares of common stock. Including issuances under the DRPlus and employee benefit plans, Ameren plans to issue approximately $600 million of equity each year from 2025 to 2029. As of December 31, 2024, Ameren had approximately $550 million of common stock available for sale under the ATM program, which takes into account the forward sale agreements in effect as of December 31, 2024. The Ameren Companies expect their equity to total capitalization and cash flow metrics to support solid investment-grade credit ratings. See Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on the ATM program, including the forward sale agreements under the ATM program relating to common stock.\nThe following table presents net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nNet Cash Provided By\nOperating Activities\nNet Cash Used In\nInvesting Activities\nNet Cash Provided By\nFinancing Activities\n2024\n2023\nVariance\n2024\n2023\nVariance\n2024\n2023\nVariance\nAmeren\n$\n2,763\n \n(a)\n$\n2,564 \n(a)\n$\n199 \n$\n(4,456)\n$\n(3,798)\n$\n(658)\n$\n1,749\n \n$\n1,290 \n$\n459 \nAmeren Missouri\n1,523\n \n1,341 \n182 \n(2,898)\n(1,960)\n(938)\n1,382\n \n616 \n766 \nAmeren Illinois\n1,369\n \n(a)\n1,098 \n(a)\n271 \n(1,466)\n(1,733)\n267 \n165\n \n678 \n(513)\n(a)    Both Ameren and Ameren Illinois’ cash provided by operating activities included cash outflows of $125 million and $123 million for the FEJA electric energy-efficiency rider and $39 million and $9 million for the customer generation rebate program in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur cash provided by operating activities is affected by fluctuations of trade accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts and wages payable, among other things, as well as the unique regulatory environment for each of our businesses. Substantially all expenditures related to fuel, purchased power, and natural gas purchased for resale are recovered from customers through rate adjustment mechanisms, which may be adjusted without a traditional regulatory rate review, subject to prudence reviews. Similar regulatory mechanisms exist for certain other operating expenses that can also affect the timing of cash provided by operating activities. The timing of cash payments for costs recoverable under our regulatory mechanisms differs from the recovery period of those costs. Additionally, the seasonality of our electric and natural gas businesses, primarily caused by seasonal customer rates and changes in customer demand due to weather, significantly affects the amount and timing of our cash provided by operating activities. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for more information about our regulatory frameworks.\nAmeren\nAmeren’s cash provided by operating activities increased $199 million in 2024, compared with 2023.

The following items contributed to the increase:\n•\nA $148 million increase due to an income tax refund from Ameren (parent), pursuant to the tax allocation agreement, primarily due to lower taxable income compared to 2023, mainly driven by the adoption of IRS issued guidance for the 2024 tax year that provided a safe harbor method of accounting for the capitalization or deduction of certain expenditures to maintain, repair, replace, or improve natural gas distribution property.\n•\nA $139 million increase resulting from increased customer collections primarily from base rate increases effective November 28, 2023, pursuant to the November 2023 natural gas rate order and electric transmission rate base growth, and by increased customer collections under cost recovery mechanisms.\n59\nTable\n of Contents\n•\nA $34 million increase due to the timing of payments for accounts payable and prepaid expenses.\n•\nA $22 million increase due to insurance proceeds received in 2024 related to workers’ compensation payments made in 2023.\n•\nA $20 million increase due to workers’ compensation payments made in 2023.\n•\nA $19 million increase due to higher major storm restoration costs in 2023 due to storms in the summer of 2023.\nThe following items partially offset the increase in Ameren Illinois’ cash from operating activities between periods:\n•\nA $43 million increase in net collateral posted with counterparties, primarily due to changes in the market prices of power and natural gas.\n•\nA $29 million increase in the cost of natural gas held in storage due to changes in the market price of natural gas.\n•\nAn $18 million increase in interest payments, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding debt and an increase in interest rates.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nAmeren’s cash used in investing activities increased $658 million during 2024, compared with 2023, primarily as a result of a $722 million increase in capital expenditures, largely resulting from the acquisitions and completion of the Cass County, Boomtown, and Huck Finn energy centers at Ameren Missouri. Ameren’s increase in capital expenditures was partially offset by decreased expenditures for electric transmission infrastructure upgrades, reduced expenditures for electric distribution infrastructure upgrades and natural gas infrastructure upgrades due to steps taken by Ameren Illinois to align its 2024 operations with the ICC’s MYRP orders and November 2023 natural gas rate order, and due to decreased storm-related expenditures of $92 million at Ameren Illinois. Ameren’s cash used in investing activities was also partially offset by an $83 million decrease due to the timing of nuclear fuel expenditures.\nAmeren Missouri’s cash used in investing activities increased $938 million during 2024, compared with 2023, primarily as a result of a $952 million increase in capital expenditures, largely resulting from the acquisitions and completion of the Cass County, Boomtown, and Huck Finn energy centers. Ameren Missouri’s cash used in investing activities also increased as a result of a $43 million increase in net money pool advances, and was partially offset by an $83 million\n \ndecrease due to the timing of nuclear fuel expenditures.\nAmeren Illinois’ cash used in investing activities decreased $267 million during 2024, compared with 2023, due to a decrease in capital expenditures, largely resulting from decreased expenditures for electric transmission infrastructure upgrades. Ameren Illinois’ capital expenditures also decreased as a result of reduced expenditures for electric distribution infrastructure upgrades and natural gas infrastructure upgrades due to steps taken by Ameren Illinois to align its 2024 operations with the ICC’s MYRP orders and November 2023 natural gas rate order, and due to decreased storm-related expenditures of $92 million.\n60\nTable\n of Contents\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following charts present our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n2024 – Total Ameren $4,319\n(a)\n2023 – Total Ameren $3,597\n(a)\nAmeren Missouri\n(b)\nAmeren Illinois Natural Gas\nATXI and other electric transmission subsidiaries\nAmeren Illinois Electric Distribution\nAmeren Illinois Transmission\n(a)\nIncludes Other capital expenditures of $6 million and $(18) million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which includes amounts for the elimination of intercompany transfers.\nAmeren’s 2024 capital expenditures consisted of expenditures made by its subsidiaries, including $134 million by ATXI and other electric transmission subsidiaries. Ameren’s 2023 capital expenditures consisted of expenditures made by its subsidiaries, including $124 million by ATXI and other electric transmission subsidiaries. In both years, capital expenditures were made principally to maintain, upgrade, and improve the reliability of the transmission and distribution systems of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois by investing in substation upgrades, energy center projects, and smart-grid technology. Additionally, the Ameren Companies invested in various software projects.\nThe following table presents Ameren’s estimate of capital expenditures that will be incurred from 2025 through 2029, including construction expenditures, allowance for funds used during construction, and expenditures for compliance with existing environmental regulations:\n2025\n2026 – 2029\nTotal\nAmeren Missouri\n$\n2,455 \n$\n13,585 \n–\n$\n15,015 \n$\n16,040 \n–\n$\n17,470 \nAmeren Illinois Electric Distribution\n625 \n2,440 \n–\n2,695 \n3,065 \n–\n3,320 \nAmeren Illinois Natural Gas\n360 \n1,305 \n–\n1,445 \n1,665 \n–\n1,805 \nAmeren Illinois Transmission\n525 \n1,230 \n–\n1,360 \n1,755 \n–\n1,885 \nATXI and other electric transmission subsidiaries\n220 \n2,380 \n–\n2,630 \n2,600 \n–\n2,850 \nOther\n10 \n30 \n–\n35 \n40 \n–\n45 \nAmeren\n$\n4,195 \n$\n20,970 \n–\n$\n23,180 \n$\n25,165 \n–\n$\n27,375 \nAmeren Missouri’s estimated capital expenditures include transmission, distribution, grid modernization, and generation-related investments, primarily renewable and natural gas generation, as well as expenditures for compliance \nwith environmental regulations\n. \nAmeren Illinois’ estimated capital expenditures are primarily for electric and natural gas transmission and distribution-related investments.\n61\nTable\n of Contents\nIn February 2025, Ameren Missouri filed an update to its Smart Energy Plan with the MoPSC, which includes a five-year capital investment overview with a detailed one-year plan for 2025. The plan is designed to upgrade Ameren Missouri’s electric infrastructure and includes investments that will upgrade the grid and accommodate more renewable energy. Investments under the plan are expected to total approximately $16.2 billion over the five-year period from 2025 through 2029, with expenditures largely recoverable under the PISA. Ameren Missouri’s Smart Energy Plan includes approximately $1 billion in capital expenditures that may be necessary to comply with regulations issued by the EPA in 2024 relating to CO\n2\n emissions and MATS, if such regulations are not revised or overturned. See Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for additional information on the EPA regulations. The Smart Energy Plan excludes investments in its natural gas distribution business, as well as removal costs, net of salvage.\nAmeren Missouri continually reviews its generation portfolio and expected power needs, including estimates of future load growth. As a result, Ameren Missouri could modify its plan for generation capacity, the type of generation asset technology that will be employed, and whether capacity or power may be purchased, among other changes. Additionally, we continually review the reliability of our transmission and distribution systems, expected capacity needs, and opportunities for transmission investments within and outside our service territories. The timing and amount of investments could vary because of changes in expected capacity, the condition of transmission and distribution systems, significant changes in environmental regulations, future rate orders, and our ability and willingness to pursue transmission investments, as well as our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, among other factors. Any changes in future generation, transmission, or distribution needs could result in significant changes in capital expenditures or losses, which could be material. Compliance with environmental regulations could also have significant impacts on the level of capital expenditures.\nIn 2021, the MISO issued a report outlining a preliminary long-range transmission planning roadmap of projects through 2039, which considers the rapidly changing generation mix within MISO resulting from significant additions of renewable generation, actual and expected generation plant closures, and state mandates or goals for clean energy or carbon emissions reductions. In 2022, the MISO approved the first tranche of projects under the roadmap. A portion of these projects were assigned to various utilities, of which Ameren was awarded projects that are estimated to cost approximately $1.8 billion, based on the MISO’s cost estimate. Related to these projects, Ameren began substation upgrades in May 2024 in advance of transmission line construction, which is expected to begin in 2026, with forecasted completion dates near the end of this decade. In addition, the MISO awarded three competitive bid projects to ATXI that represent a total estimated investment of approximately $220 million for ATXI. Also in December 2024, the MISO approved a first set of second tranche projects. A portion of these projects were assigned to Ameren and are estimated to cost approximately $1.3 billion, based on the MISO’s cost estimate. The first set of second tranche projects also includes competitive bid projects that are estimated to cost $6.5 billion, which includes projects located in Illinois that are estimated to cost $1.8 billion, based on the MISO’s cost estimate. The competitive bid process is expected to take place through 2026. The MISO is assessing future long-range transmission scenarios in the first quarter of 2025 and development of a second set of second tranche projects will follow this assessment.\nEnvironmental Capital Expenditures\nAmeren Missouri will continue to incur costs to comply with federal and state regulations, including those requiring the reduction of SO\n2\n, NO\nx\n, CO\n2\n, and mercury emissions from its coal-fired energy centers, compliance with the CCR Rule, and potential modifications to cooling water intake structures at existing power plants under Clean Water Act rules. See Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of existing and proposed environmental laws that affect, or may affect, our facilities and capital expenditures to comply with such laws.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by, or used in, financing activities is a result of our financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by operating activities, the level of cash used in investing activities, the level of dividends, and our long-term debt maturities, among other things.\nAmeren’s cash provided by financing activities increased $459 million during 2024, compared with 2023. During 2024, Ameren utilized net proceeds of $2.5 billion from the issuance of long-term debt for capital expenditures, to repay then-outstanding short-term debt, to repay $49 million of maturities of long-term debt at ATXI, and \nto finance energy transition costs related to the accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center, which included the remaining unrecovered net plant balance associated with the facility, among other costs\n. In addition, Ameren utilized proceeds from net commercial paper issuances of $607 million, aggregate cash proceeds of $273 million from the issuance of common stock under the ATM program, the DRPlus, and the 401(k) plan, and cash provided by operating activities to repay $800 million of long-term debt maturities at Ameren (parent) and Ameren Missouri, and to fund, in part, capital expenditures. In comparison, in 2023, Ameren utilized net proceeds of $2.3 billion from the issuance of long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for capital expenditures, to repay then-outstanding short-term debt, and to repay $100 million of maturities of long-term debt. Ameren also repaid net commercial borrowings totaling $533 million. In addition, Ameren utilized \naggregate cash proceeds of \n$346 million\n from the issuance of common stock under the ATM program, the DRPlus, and the 401(k) plan, and \ncash provided by operating activities to fund, in part, capital expenditures.\n \nDuring 2024, Ameren paid common stock dividends of $714 million, compared with $662 million in dividend payments in 2023.\n62\nTable\n of Contents\nAmeren Missouri’s cash provided by financing activities increased $766 million during 2024, compared with 2023. During 2024, Ameren Missouri utilized net proceeds of $1.8 billion from the issuance of long-term debt for capital expenditures, to repay then-outstanding short-term debt, and \nto finance energy transition costs related to the accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center, which included the remaining unrecovered net plant balance associated with the facility, among other costs\n. In addition, Ameren Missouri repaid $350 million of long-term debt maturities, $170 million of net commercial paper borrowings, and $306 million of money pool borrowings. During 2024, Ameren Missouri also utilized capital contributions from Ameren (parent) of $476 million along with cash provided by operating activities to fund, in part, capital expenditures. In comparison, in 2023, Ameren Missouri utilized net proceeds of $499 million from the issuance of long-term debt for capital expenditures and to repay then-outstanding short-term debt. Ameren Missouri also repaid net commercial paper borrowings totaling $159 million. In addition, during 2023, Ameren Missouri utilized net proceeds of $306 million from money pool borrowings along with cash provided by operating activities to fund, in part, capital expenditures.\nAmeren Illinois’ cash provided by financing activities decreased $513 million during 2024, compared with 2023. During 2024, Ameren Illinois utilized net proceeds of $624 million from the issuance of long-term debt to repay then-outstanding short-term debt. In addition, Ameren Illinois repaid net commercial paper borrowings of $277 million and money pool borrowings of $98 million. During 2024, Ameren Illinois also utilized capital contributions from Ameren (parent) of $36 million along with cash provided by operating activities to fund, in part, capital expenditures. In comparison, in 2023, Ameren Illinois utilized net proceeds of $498 million from the issuance of long-term debt to repay then-outstanding short-term debt and $100 million of long-term debt maturities. In addition, Ameren Illinois utilized proceeds from net commercial paper issuances of $102 million, proceeds of $135 million from money pool borrowings, and capital contributions from Ameren (parent) of $91 million along with cash provided by operating activities to fund, in part, capital expenditures. During 2024, Ameren Illinois paid common stock dividends of $110 million, compared with $41 million in dividend payments in 2023.\nShort-term Debt and Liquidity\nThe liquidity needs of the Ameren Companies are supported through the use of available cash, drawings under committed credit agreements, commercial paper issuances, and/or, in the case of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, short-term affiliate borrowings. See Note 4 – Short-term Debt and Liquidity under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on credit agreements, commercial paper issuances, Ameren’s money pool arrangements and related borrowings, and relevant interest rates.\nThe following table presents Ameren’s consolidated net available liquidity as of December 31, 2024:\nAvailable at \nDecember 31, 2024\nAmeren (parent) and Ameren Missouri\n(a)\n:\nMissouri Credit Agreement \n–\n borrowing capacity\n$\n1,400 \nLess: Ameren (parent) commercial paper outstanding\n621 \nLess: Letters of credit\n18 \nMissouri Credit Agreement \n–\n subtotal\n761 \nAmeren (parent) and Ameren Illinois\n(b)\n:\nIllinois Credit Agreement \n–\n borrowing capacity\n1,200 \nLess: Ameren (parent) commercial paper outstanding\n434 \nLess: Ameren Illinois commercial paper outstanding\n88 \nLess: Letters of credit\n4 \nIllinois Credit Agreement \n–\n subtotal\n674 \nSubtotal\n$\n1,435 \nCash and cash equivalents\n7 \nNet available liquidity\n(c)\n$\n1,442 \n(a)     The maximum aggregate amount available to both Ameren (parent) and Ameren Missouri under the Missouri Credit Agreement is $1 billion.\n(b)     The maximum aggregate amount available to Ameren (parent) and Ameren Illinois under the Illinois Credit Agreement is $700 million and $1 billion, respectively.\n(c)     Does not include Ameren’s forward equity sale agreements. See Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information.\nThe Credit Agreements, among other things, provide $2.6 billion of credit until maturity in December 2028. See Note 4 – Short-term Debt and Liquidity under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on the Credit Agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Ameren (parent), Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois each issued commercial paper. Borrowings under the Credit Agreements and commercial paper issuances are based upon available interest rates at that time of the borrowing or issuance.\nAmeren has a money pool agreement with and among its utility subsidiaries to coordinate and to provide for certain short-term cash and working capital requirements. As short-term capital needs arise, and based on availability of funding sources, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois will access funds from the utility money pool, the Credit Agreements, or the commercial paper programs depending on which option has the lowest interest rates.\n63\nTable\n of Contents\nThe issuance of short-term debt securities by Ameren’s utility subsidiaries is subject to FERC approval under the Federal Power Act. In January 2025, the FERC issued orders authorizing Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI to issue up to $1.4 billion, $1 billion, and $500 million, respectively, of short-term debt securities through January 2027.\nThe Ameren Companies continually evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of their liquidity arrangements for changing business conditions. When business conditions warrant, changes may be made to the existing Credit Agreements or to other borrowing arrangements, or other arrangements may be made.\nLong-term Debt and Equity\nThe following table presents Ameren’s issuances (net of any issuance premiums or discounts) of long-term debt and equity, as well as redemptions and maturities of long-term debt for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For additional information related to the terms and uses of these issuances and effective registration statements, and Ameren’s forward sale agreements relating to common stock, see Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

No cash was exchanged in connection with the termination of the agreement as the $240 million principal amount of the financing obligation due from Ameren Missouri was equal to the amount of bond service payments due to Ameren Missouri.\n64\nTable\n of Contents\n(g)    Excludes Ameren (parent)’s November and December 2024 purchases of \nsenior secured notes and first mortgage bonds issued by Ameren Missouri and first mortgage bonds issued by Ameren Illinois for $44 million in aggregate.\nThe Ameren Companies may sell securities registered under their effective registration statements if market conditions and capital requirements warrant such sales. Any offer and sale will be made only by means of a prospectus that meets the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nIndebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants\nAt December 31, 2024, the Ameren Companies were in compliance with the provisions and covenants contained within their credit agreements, indentures, and articles of incorporation, as applicable, and ATXI was in compliance with the provisions and covenants contained in its note purchase agreements. See Note 4 – Short-term Debt and Liquidity and Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of covenants and provisions (and applicable cross-default provisions) contained in our credit agreements, certain of the Ameren Companies’ indentures and articles of incorporation, and ATXI’s note purchase agreements.\nWe consider access to short-term and long-term capital and credit markets to be a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by our operating activities. Inability to raise capital on reasonable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses. After assessing its current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois each believes that it will continue to have access to the capital and credit markets on reasonable terms. However, events beyond Ameren’s, Ameren Missouri’s, and Ameren Illinois’ control may create uncertainty in the capital and credit markets or make access to the capital and credit markets uncertain or limited. Such events could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital and credit markets.\nDividends\nAmeren paid to its shareholders common stock dividends totaling $714 million, or $2.68 per share, in 2024 and $662 million, or $2.52 per share, in 2023. The amount and timing of dividends payable on Ameren’s common stock are within the sole discretion of Ameren’s board of directors. Ameren’s board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends, but it considers various factors, including Ameren’s overall payout ratio, payout ratios of our peers, projected cash flow and potential future cash flow requirements, historical earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, impacts of regulatory orders or legislation, and other key business considerations. Ameren expects its dividend payout ratio to be between 55% and 65% of earnings over the next few years. On February 7, 2025, the board of directors of Ameren declared a quarterly dividend on Ameren’s common stock of 71 cents per share, payable on March 31, 2025, to shareholders of record on March 11, 2025.\nCertain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that, among other things, restrict the Ameren Companies’ payment of dividends in certain circumstances.\nAmeren Illinois’ articles of incorporation require its dividend payments on common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions with respect to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus. Additionally, Ameren has committed to the FERC to maintain a minimum of 30% equity in the capital structure at Ameren Illinois.\nAmeren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, as well as certain other nonregistrant Ameren subsidiaries, are subject to Section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act, which makes it unlawful for any officer or director of a public utility, as defined in the Federal Power Act, to participate in the making or paying of any dividend from any funds “properly included in capital account.” The FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed, (2) the dividends are not excessive, and (3) there is no self-dealing on the part of corporate officials. At a minimum, Ameren believes that dividends can be paid by its subsidiaries that are public utilities from net income and from retained earnings. In addition, under Illinois law, Ameren Illinois and ATXI may not pay any dividend on their respective stock unless, among other things, their respective earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provisions are made for reasonable and proper reserves, or unless Ameren Illinois or ATXI has specific authorization from the ICC.\nAt December 31, 2024, the amount of restricted net assets of Ameren’s subsidiaries that may not be distributed to Ameren in the form of a loan or dividend was $4.0 billion.\n65\nTable\n of Contents\nThe following table presents common stock dividends declared and paid by Ameren Corporation to its common shareholders and by Ameren subsidiaries to their parent, Ameren:\n2024\n2023\nAmeren\n$\n714\n \n$\n662 \nAmeren Missouri\n—\n \n9 \nAmeren Illinois\n110\n \n41 \nATXI\n30\n \n123 \nAmeren Missouri and Ameren Illinois each have issued preferred stock, which provide for cumulative dividends. Each company’s board of directors considers the declaration of preferred stock dividends to shareholders of record on a certain date, stating the date on which the dividend is payable and the amount to be paid. See Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for further detail concerning the preferred stock issuances.\nCredit Ratings\nOur credit ratings affect our liquidity, our access to the capital and credit markets and credit markets, our cost of borrowing under our credit facilities and our commercial paper programs, and our collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts.\nThe following table presents the principal credit ratings of the Ameren Companies by Moody’s and S&P effective on the date of this report:\nMoody’s\nS&P\nAmeren:\nIssuer/corporate credit rating\nBaa1\nBBB+\nSenior unsecured debt\nBaa1\nBBB\nCommercial paper\nP-2\nA-2\nAmeren Missouri:\nIssuer/corporate credit rating\nBaa1\nBBB+\nSenior debt\nA2\nA\nSenior unsecured debt\nBaa1\nNot Rated\nCommercial paper\nP-2\nA-2\nAMF securitized utility tariff bonds\nAaa\nAAA\nAmeren Illinois:\nIssuer/corporate credit rating\nA3\nBBB+\nSenior debt\nA1\nA\nSenior unsecured debt\nA3\nBBB+\nCommercial paper\nP-2\nA-2\nATXI:\nIssuer credit rating\nA2\nNot Rated\nSenior unsecured debt\nA2\nNot Rated\nA credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. It should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.\nCollateral Postings\nAny weakening of our credit ratings may reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. Such changes may also increase the cost of borrowing, resulting in an adverse effect on earnings. Cash collateral postings and prepayments made with external parties, including postings related to exchange-traded contracts, were immaterial, and cash collateral posted by external parties were $58 million for Ameren and Ameren Illinois at December 31, 2024. A sub-investment-grade issuer or senior unsecured debt rating (below “Baa3” from Moody’s or below “BBB-” from S&P) at December 31, 2024, could have resulted in Ameren, Ameren Missouri, or Ameren Illinois being required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade and contractual obligations amounting to $740 million, $699 million, and $41 million, respectively.\nChanges in commodity prices could trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. Based on credit ratings at December 31, 2024, if market prices were 15% higher or lower than December 31, 2024 levels in the next 12 months and 20% higher or lower thereafter through the end of the term of the commodity contracts, then Ameren, Ameren Missouri, or Ameren Illinois could be required to post an immaterial amount, compared to each company’s liquidity, of collateral or provide other assurances for certain trade and contractual obligations.\n66\nTable\n of Contents\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur electric generation, transmission, and distribution and natural gas distribution and storage operations must comply with a variety of statutes and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including permitting programs implemented by federal, state, and local authorities. Such environmental laws regulate air emissions; protect water bodies; manage the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; siting and land use requirements; and potential ecological impacts. See Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for a discussion of existing and proposed environmental laws, including those that relate to climate change, that affect, or may affect, our facilities, operations, and capital expenditures to comply with such laws. The individual or combined effects of compliance with existing and new environmental regulations could result in significant capital expenditures, increased operating costs, or the closure or alteration of operations at some of Ameren Missouri’s energy centers.\nAdditionally, international agreements have in the past, and could again, lead to future federal or state legislation or regulations. In 2015, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change reached consensus among approximately 190 nations on an agreement, known as the Paris Agreement, that establishes a framework for greenhouse gas mitigation actions by all countries, with a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and an aspiration to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In accordance with the new presidential administration’s approach to United States energy policy, in January 2025, the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement. The current federal administration is expected to review, and has already revised, compliance requirements under a number of federal environmental regulatory programs; however, differences in energy policy priorities adopted by future federal administrations could result in additional greenhouse gas reduction requirements in the United States.\nWe provide information regarding our sustainability initiatives through our website, including in our annual sustainability report, our responses to the annual climate change and water surveys conducted by CDP, and a sustainability investor presentation. In addition, we issue an annual report in accordance with the Edison Electric Institute’s (EEI) and American Gas Association’s (AGA) environmental, social, governance and sustainability-related reporting program. We also issue a periodic climate risk report aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and a report on our management of CCR. Additionally, we have posted a Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) mapping of sustainability data. The reports may be updated at any time. The information on Ameren’s website, including the reports and documents mentioned in this paragraph, is not incorporated by reference into this report.\nOUTLOOK\nBelow are some key trends, events, and uncertainties that may reasonably affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, as well as our ability to achieve strategic and financial objectives, for 2025 and beyond. For additional information regarding recent rate orders, lawsuits, and pending requests filed with state and federal regulatory commissions, including those discussed below, see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nOperations\n•\nThe PISA permits Ameren Missouri to defer and recover 85% of the depreciation expense for investments in qualifying property, plant, and equipment placed in service and not included in base rates. Investments not eligible for recovery under the PISA include amounts related to new nuclear and natural gas generating units and service to new customer premises. Additionally, the PISA permits Ameren Missouri to earn a return at the applicable WACC on 85% of rate base that incorporates those qualifying investments, as well as changes in total accumulated depreciation excluding retirements and plant-related deferred income taxes since the previous regulatory rate review. The regulatory asset for accumulated PISA deferrals also earns a return at the applicable WACC until added to rate base prospectively. Ameren Missouri recognizes an offset to “Interest Charges” on its consolidated statement of income for its carrying cost of debt relating to each return allowed under the PISA, with the difference between the applicable WACC and its carrying cost of debt recognized in revenues when recovery of PISA deferrals is reflected in customer rates. Approved PISA deferrals are recovered over a period of 20 years following a regulatory rate review. Additionally, under the RESRAM, Ameren Missouri is permitted to recover the 15% of depreciation expense not recovered under the PISA, and earn a return at the applicable WACC for investments in renewable generation plant placed in service to comply with Missouri’s renewable energy standard. Accumulated RESRAM deferrals earn carrying costs at short-term interest rates. The PISA and the RESRAM mitigate the effects of regulatory lag between regulatory rate reviews. Those investments not eligible for recovery under the PISA and the remaining 15% of certain property, plant, and equipment placed in service, unless eligible for recovery under the RESRAM, remain subject to regulatory lag. Pursuant to a Missouri law that became effective in August 2022, Ameren Missouri’s PISA election was extended through 2028 and an additional extension through 2033 is allowed if requested by Ameren Missouri and approved by the MoPSC, among other things.\n67\nTable\n of Contents\n•\nIn June 2024, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the MoPSC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for electric service. In February 2025, Ameren Missouri filed an updated electric rate increase request seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for electric service by $446 million. The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed electric service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, with a decision by the MoPSC expected by May 2025 and new rates effective by June 2025. Ameren Missouri cannot predict the level of any electric service rate change the MoPSC may approve, whether the requested regulatory recovery mechanisms will be continued, or whether any rate change that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for Ameren Missouri to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments when the rate change goes into effect.\n•\nIn June 2024, the MoPSC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds by AMF related to the accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center. The financing order also included a determination that the decision to retire the Rush Island Energy Center was reasonable and prudent. The MoPSC did not make a determination regarding the prudency of Ameren Missouri's prior actions that resulted in the adverse ruling in the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation, however, claims regarding such actions could be considered in future regulatory proceedings. If future regulatory proceedings result in revenue reductions based on Ameren Missouri’s prior actions that resulted in the adverse ruling in the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren and Ameren Missouri. Base rate revenues relating to the recovery of the Rush Island Energy Center are being deferred as a regulatory liability since the October 15, 2024 retirement date of the facility until new rates become effective related to the current electric service regulatory rate review. The amortization period for the regulatory liability will be determined in a future regulatory rate review.\n•\nIn September 2024, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the MoPSC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by $40 million. The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, with a decision by the MoPSC expected by August 2025 and new rates effective by September 2025. Ameren Missouri cannot predict the level of any natural gas delivery service rate change the MoPSC may approve, whether the requested regulatory recovery mechanisms will be continued, or whether any rate change that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for Ameren Missouri to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments when the rate change goes into effect.\n•\nIn November 2024, the MoPSC issued an order approving a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement for Ameren Missouri’s MEEIA 2025 plan, which includes a portfolio of customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs, along with the continued use of the MEEIA rider, which allows Ameren Missouri to collect from customers its actual MEEIA program costs, related lost electric revenues, and performance incentives. Ameren Missouri intends to invest $51 million annually in 2025 and 2026 and $22 million in 2027 for customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs. In addition, the order approved performance incentives applicable to each plan year to earn revenues by achieving certain spending and demand response goals. If 100% of the goals are achieved in 2025, 2026, and 2027, Ameren Missouri would earn performance incentive revenues of $5 million, $5 million, and $2 million, respectively.\n•\nAmeren Illinois and ATXI use a forward-looking rate calculation with an annual revenue requirement reconciliation for each company’s electric transmission business. Based on expected rate base and the currently allowed 10.48% ROE, which includes a 50-basis-point incentive adder for participation in an RTO, the revenue requirements that will be included in 2025 rates for Ameren Illinois’ and ATXI’s electric transmission businesses are $643 million and $232 million, respectively. These revenue requirements represent increases in Ameren Illinois’ and ATXI’s revenue requirements of $94 million and $9 million, respectively, from the revenue requirements reflected in 2024 rates, primarily due to higher expected rate base. These rates will affect Ameren Illinois’ and ATXI’s cash receipts during 2025, but will not determine their respective electric transmission service operating revenues, which will instead be based on 2025 actual recoverable costs, rate base, and a return on rate base at the applicable WACC as calculated under the FERC formula ratemaking framework.\n•\nThe allowed base ROE for FERC-regulated transmission rates previously charged under the MISO tariff has been the subject of pending proceedings since 2013. In October 2024, the FERC issued an order, which decreased the allowed base ROE from 10.02% to 9.98% and required refunds, with interest, for the periods from November 2013 to February 2015 and from late September 2016 forward. In November 2024, the MISO transmission owners, including Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI, filed a request for rehearing with the FERC, arguing, among other things, the FERC should not have ordered refunds back to September 2016 or imposed interest on those refunds. In January 2025, the same parties filed an appeal of the October 2024 order to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In March 2020, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on its transmission incentives policy, which proposed to increase the incentive ROE for participation in an RTO to 100 basis points from the current 50 basis points and revised the parameters for awarding incentives, while limiting the overall incentives to a cap of 250 basis points, among other things. In April 2021, the FERC issued a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which proposed to modify the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking’s incentive for participation in an RTO by limiting this incentive for utilities that join an RTO to 50 basis points and only allowing them to earn the incentive for three years, among other things. If this proposal is included in a final rule, Ameren Illinois and ATXI would no longer be eligible for the 50 basis point RTO incentive adder, prospectively. The FERC is under no deadline to issue a final rule on this matter. Ameren is unable to predict the ultimate impact of any changes to the FERC’s incentives policy. A 50-basis-\n68\nTable\n of Contents\npoint change in the FERC-allowed ROE would affect Ameren’s and Ameren Illinois’ annual net income by an estimated $17 million and $12 million, respectively, based on each company’s 2025 projected rate base.\n•\nPursuant to December 2022 and March 2021 ICC orders, Ameren Illinois used the IEIMA formula framework to establish annual electric distribution service rates effective through 2023, and reconciled the related revenue requirement for customer rates established for 2023. As such, Ameren Illinois’ 2023 revenues reflected actual recoverable costs, year-end rate base, and a return at the applicable WACC, with the ROE component based on the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. In December 2024, the ICC issued an order approving Ameren Illinois’ 2023 electric distribution service revenue requirement reconciliation adjustment filing. This order approved a reconciliation adjustment of $158 million. The approved reconciliation adjustment will be collected from customers in 2025.\n•\nPursuant to the CEJA, Ameren Illinois may file an MYRP with the ICC to establish base rates for electric distribution service to be charged to customers for each calendar year of a four-year period. The base rates for a particular calendar year are based on forecasted recoverable costs and an ICC-determined ROE applied to Ameren Illinois’ forecasted average annual rate base using a forecasted capital structure, with a common equity ratio of up to 50% being deemed prudent and reasonable by law and a higher equity ratio requiring specific ICC approval. The ROE determined by the ICC for each calendar year of the four-year period is subject to annual adjustments based on certain performance incentives and penalties. An MYRP allows Ameren Illinois to reconcile electric distribution service rates to its actual revenue requirement on an annual basis, subject to a reconciliation cap and adjustments to the ROE. Under the MYRP discussed below, Ameren Illinois’ 2025 electric distribution service revenues will be based on its 2025 actual recoverable costs, 2025 year-end rate base, and an ROE of 8.72%, as adjusted for any performance incentives or penalties, provided the actual revenue requirement does not exceed the reconciliation cap. If a given year’s revenue amount collected from customers varies from the approved revenue requirement, an adjustment is made to electric operating revenues with an offset to a regulatory asset or liability to reflect that year’s actual revenue requirement. The regulatory balance is then collected from, or refunded to, customers within two years from the end of the applicable annual period. Additionally, the RBA ensures electric distribution service revenues are decoupled from sales volumes and wholesale and miscellaneous revenue differences from those assumed in the revenue requirement approved by the ICC. The RBA remains effective whether Ameren Illinois elects to file an MYRP or a traditional regulatory rate review.\n•\nIn December 2024, the ICC issued an order in connection with a revised Grid Plan and a revised MYRP filed by Ameren Illinois in March 2024, approving revenue requirements for electric distribution services for 2024 through 2027 of $1,206 million, $1,287 million, $1,367 million, and $1,422 million, respectively. Using the 2023 revenue requirement as a starting point, the approved revenue requirements in the ICC’s December 2024 order represent a cumulative four-year increase of $309 million. Rate changes consistent with the December 2024 order became effective in December 2024. In January 2025, Ameren Illinois filed a request for rehearing of the ICC’s December 2024 order to revise the allowed ROE and to include an asset associated with other postretirement benefits in the rate base, among other things. Subsequently, in February 2025, the ICC denied the rehearing request. Ameren Illinois intends to file an appeal of the ICC’s December 2024 order to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District. In addition, Ameren Illinois has filed an appeal related to orders issued by the ICC in December 2023 and June 2024 related to this proceeding. The appellate court is under no deadline to address the appeal, and Ameren Illinois cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the appeal.\n•\nPursuant to Illinois law, Ameren Illinois’ electric energy-efficiency investments are deferred as a regulatory asset and earn a return at the applicable WACC, with the ROE component based on the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. The allowed ROE on electric energy-efficiency investments can be increased or decreased by up to 200 basis points, depending on the achievement of annual energy savings goals. While the ICC has approved a plan for Ameren Illinois to invest approximately $120 million per year in electric energy-efficiency programs through 2025, the ICC has the ability to reduce the amount of electric energy-efficiency savings goals in future program years if there are insufficient cost-effective programs available, which could reduce the investments in electric energy-efficiency programs. Ameren Illinois expects to file its next electric energy-efficiency plan for 2026 through 2029 in late February 2025.\n•\nIn January 2025, Ameren Illinois filed a request with the ICC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by $140 million. A decision by the ICC in this proceeding is required by early December 2025, with new rates expected to be effective in December 2025. Ameren Illinois cannot predict the level of any delivery service rate change the ICC may approve, nor whether any rate change that may eventually be approved will be sufficient to enable Ameren Illinois to recover its costs and to earn a reasonable return on investments when the rate changes go into effect. \n•\nThe November 2023 order also directed the ICC staff to develop a plan for a future of gas proceeding. All of the Illinois natural gas utilities subject to ICC regulation are included in this proceeding, which is exploring issues involving the decarbonization of the natural gas distribution system in light of the state of Illinois’ goal of economy-wide 100% clean energy by 2050, pursuant to the CEJA. Some of the issues being addressed include the mitigation of any natural gas distribution stranded assets, the role of energy efficiency in decarbonization, and the associated impacts of natural gas decarbonization to the electric distribution system, among others. A final ICC staff report is expected in early 2026 and will be used by the ICC to guide further action, if any.\n69\nTable\n of Contents\n•\nAmeren Missouri’s next refueling and maintenance outage at its Callaway energy center is scheduled for the spring of 2025. During a scheduled refueling, which occurs every 18 months, maintenance expenses are deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized until the completion of the next refueling and maintenance outage. During an outage, depending on the availability of its other generation sources and the market prices for power, Ameren Missouri’s purchased power costs may increase and the amount of excess power available for sale may decrease versus non-outage years. Changes in purchased power costs and excess power available for sale are included in the FAC, which results in limited impacts to earnings. In addition, Ameren Missouri may incur increased non-nuclear energy center maintenance costs in non-outage years.\n•\nPursuant to Illinois law, Ameren Missouri's natural gas-fired energy centers in Illinois are subject to annual limits on emissions, including CO\n2\n and NO\nx\n. Further reductions to emissions limits will become effective between 2030 and 2040, resulting in the closure of the Venice Energy Center by the end of 2029. The reductions could also limit the operations of Ameren Missouri's four other natural gas-fired energy centers located in the state of Illinois, and will result in their closure by 2040. These energy centers are utilized to support peak loads. Subject to conditions in the CEJA, these energy centers may be allowed to exceed the emissions limits in order to maintain reliability of electric utility service.\n•\nAmeren Missouri and Ameren Illinois continue to make infrastructure investments and expect to seek increases to electric and natural gas rates to recover the cost of investments and earn an adequate return. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois will also seek new, or to maintain existing, regulatory and legislative solutions to address regulatory lag and to support investment in their utility infrastructure for the benefit of their customers. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois continue to face cost recovery pressures, higher cost of debt, customer conservation efforts, the impacts of additional customer energy-efficiency programs, and increased customer use of increasingly cost-effective advancements in innovative energy technologies, including private generation and energy storage. We expect a net increase in demand resulting from the electrification of the economy, including in the transportation sector. In addition, a new 250-MW data center is expected to be constructed in Ameren Missouri’s service territory with electric service starting in 2026. Several other entities in various industries, including data center and manufacturing, are considering either locating or expanding their operations within our service territories. To serve these new loads, we expect increased investments will be necessary, including expected future investments for environmental compliance, system reliability improvements, and new generation sources, that will result in rate base and revenue growth but also higher depreciation and financing costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nAs discussed above, several entities in various industries, including data center and manufacturing, are considering either locating or expanding their operations within Ameren Missouri’s service territory. In order to address these load growth opportunities, Ameren Missouri expects to file a notice of change in its preferred resource plan with the MoPSC in February 2025. Ameren is continuing to target net-zero carbon emissions by 2045, as well as a 60% reduction by 2030 and an 85% reduction by 2040 based on 2005 levels in a safe, reliable, and affordable manner. Ameren’s goals include both reduction of direct emissions from operations (scope 1), as well as electricity usage at Ameren buildings (scope 2), including other greenhouse gas emissions of methane, nitrous oxide, and sulfur hexafluoride. Achieving these goals will be dependent on a variety of factors, including cost-effective advancements in innovative clean energy technologies and constructive federal and state energy and economic policies. The 2025 Change to the 2023 PRP is expected to include, among other things, the following:\n•\nadding 1,600 MWs of natural gas-fired simple-cycle generation by 2030, which includes the 800-MW Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project discussed below, and an additional 1,200 MWs by 2043;\n•\nadding 2,100 MWs of natural gas-fired combined-cycle generation by 2035 and an additional 1,200 MWs by 2040;\n•\nadding 3,200 MWs of renewable generation by 2030, which includes the 900 MWs of solar generation projects discussed in Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report, and an additional 1,500 MWs by 2035;\n•\nadding 1,000 MWs of battery storage by 2030 and an additional 800 MWs by 2042;\n•\nadding 1,500 MWs of nuclear generation by 2040;\n•\nretiring all of Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired energy centers by 2042;\n•\nretiring 1,800 MWs of Ameren Missouri’s natural gas-fired energy centers by 2040 to comply with Illinois law;\n•\nthe continued implementation of customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs; and\n•\nthe expectation that Ameren Missouri will seek and receive NRC approval for an extension of the operating license for the Callaway Energy Center beyond its current 2044 expiration date.\nAmeren Missouri’s plan could be affected by, among other factors: Ameren Missouri’s ability to obtain CCNs from the MoPSC, and any other required approvals for the addition of renewable resources, battery storage, or nuclear or natural gas-fired generation, retirement of energy centers, and new or continued customer energy-efficiency programs; the ability to enter into agreements for renewable, natural gas-fired, or nuclear generation and acquire or construct that generation at a reasonable cost; the ability of suppliers, contractors, and developers to meet contractual commitments and timely complete projects, which is dependent upon the availability of necessary labor, materials, and equipment, geopolitical conflict, or government actions, among other things; changes in the scope and \n70\nTable\n of Contents\ntiming of projects; the continued existence and ability to qualify for, and use or transfer, federal production or investment tax credits; the cost of wind, solar, and other renewable generation and battery storage technologies; the cost of natural gas or hydrogen CT technologies; the cost of nuclear generation; the ability to maintain system reliability during and after the transition to clean energy generation; new and/or changes in environmental regulations, including those related to CO\n2\n and other greenhouse gas emissions; energy prices; and demand; Ameren Missouri’s ability to obtain necessary rights-of-way, easements, and transmission interconnection agreements at an acceptable cost and in a timely fashion; the ability to earn an adequate return on invested capital; and the ability to raise capital on reasonable terms. The next preferred resource plan is required to be filed by October 2026.\n•\nIn October 2024, the MoPSC issued an order approving a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement filed by Ameren Missouri, the MoPSC staff, and other intervenors requesting a CCN for the Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project. The order also includes the use of a post-construction cost deferral related to the project which allows Ameren Missouri to defer and recover depreciation expense, financing costs, and applicable income taxes incurred from the date the project is placed in service to the date when project costs are reflected in updated base rates as a result of a regulatory rate review. The period of deferral would be limited to the earlier of the time the project costs are reflected in base rates or six months. The Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project is aligned with the 2025 Change to the 2023 PRP discussed above, and related expected capital expenditures are included in Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s expected capital investments discussed below.\n•\nThrough 2029, we expect to make significant capital expenditures to improve our electric and natural gas utility infrastructure, with a major portion directed to our transmission and distribution systems. We estimate that we will invest up to $27.4 billion (Ameren Missouri – up to $17.5 billion; Ameren Illinois – up to $7.0 billion; ATXI – up to $2.9 billion) of capital expenditures during the period from 2025 through 2029. These estimates include the MISO long-range transmission projects assigned to Ameren, as well as the first tranche competitive projects awarded to ATXI discussed below. Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s estimates include approximately $1 billion in capital expenditures that may be necessary to comply with regulations issued by the EPA in 2024 relating to CO\n2\n emissions and MATS, if such regulations are not revised or overturned.\n•\nIn 2021, the MISO issued a report outlining a preliminary long-range transmission planning roadmap of projects through 2039, which considers the rapidly changing generation mix within MISO resulting from significant additions of renewable generation, actual and expected generation plant closures, and state mandates or goals for clean energy or carbon emissions reductions. In 2022, the MISO approved the first tranche of projects under the roadmap. A portion of these projects were assigned to various utilities, of which Ameren was awarded projects that are estimated to cost approximately $1.8 billion, based on the MISO’s cost estimate. Related to these projects, Ameren began substation upgrades in May 2024 in advance of transmission line construction, which is expected to begin in 2026, with forecasted completion dates near the end of this decade. In addition, the MISO awarded three competitive bid projects to ATXI that represent a total estimated investment of approximately $220 million for ATXI. In February 2024, Ameren Illinois and ATXI filed a request for a CCN, among other things, with the ICC related to the portion of the MISO long-range transmission projects they will construct within the ICC’s jurisdiction. A decision by the ICC is expected by mid-2025. In 2024, ATXI filed requests for CCNs, among other things, with the MoPSC related to the MISO long-range transmission projects that it expects to construct within the MoPSC’s jurisdiction. Decisions by the MoPSC are expected in 2025. Also in December 2024, the MISO approved a first set of second tranche projects. A portion of these projects were assigned to Ameren and are estimated to cost approximately $1.3 billion, based on the MISO’s cost estimate. The first set of second tranche projects also includes competitive bid projects that are estimated to cost $6.5 billion, which includes projects located in Illinois that are estimated to cost $1.8 billion, based on the MISO’s cost estimate. The competitive bid process is expected to take place through 2026. The MISO is assessing future long-range transmission scenarios in the first quarter of 2025 and development of a second set of second tranche projects will follow this assessment.\n•\nGrid reliability, environmental, or other regulations, including those related to CO\n2\n emissions, or other actions taken by federal or state regulators, could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs. Regulations can be reviewed and repealed, and replacement or alternative regulations can be proposed or adopted by the regulatory agencies, including the EPA. See Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report, for additional information on environmental matters, including the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation. The ultimate implementation of any of these new regulations, as well as the timing of any such implementation, is uncertain. However, the individual or combined effects of existing and new environmental regulations could result in significant capital expenditures, increased operating costs, or the closure or alteration of some of Ameren Missouri’s coal and natural gas-fired energy centers. Ameren Missouri’s operating costs and capital expenditures are subject to MoPSC prudence reviews, which could result in cost disallowances, as well as regulatory lag. The cost of Ameren Illinois’ purchased power and natural gas purchased for resale could increase. However, Ameren Illinois expects that these costs would be recovered from customers with no material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s earnings could benefit from increased investment to comply with environmental regulations if those investments are reflected and recovered on a timely basis in customer rates.\n•\nThe Ameren Companies have multiyear Credit Agreements that cumulatively provide $2.6 billion of credit through December 2028, subject to a 364-day repayment term for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, with the option to seek incremental commitments to \n71\nTable\n of Contents\nincrease the cumulative credit provided to $3.2 billion. See Note 4 – Short-term Debt and Liquidity under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information regarding the Credit Agreements. See Note 5 – Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of this report for outstanding forward sale agreements under the ATM, long-term debt issuances through the date of this report, and maturities of long-term debt from 2025 to 2029 and beyond at Ameren (parent), Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. The use of cash provided by operating activities and short-term borrowings to fund capital expenditures and other long-term investments at the Ameren Companies frequently results in a working capital deficit, defined as current liabilities exceeding current assets, as was the case at December 31, 2024, for Ameren and Ameren Illinois. Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois each believe that their liquidity is adequate given their respective expected operating cash flows, capital expenditures, and financing plans, and expect to continue to have access to the capital and credit markets on reasonable terms when needed. However, there can be no assurance that significant changes in economic conditions, disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or other unforeseen events will not materially affect their ability to execute their expected operating, capital, or financing plans.\n•\nAmeren expects its cash used for currently planned capital expenditures and dividends to exceed cash provided by operating activities over the next several years. As part of its funding plan for capital expenditures, Ameren is using newly issued shares of common stock to satisfy requirements under the DRPlus and employee benefit plans and expects to continue to do so through at least 2029. Additionally, Ameren has an ATM program under which Ameren may offer and sell from time to time common stock, which includes the ability to enter into forward sale agreements, subject to market conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2024, Ameren had multiple forward sale agreements that could be settled under the ATM program with various counterparties relating to 2.5 million shares of common stock. Including issuances under the DRPlus and employee benefit plans, Ameren plans to issue approximately $600 million of equity each year from 2025 to 2029. As of December 31, 2024, Ameren had approximately $550 million of common stock available for sale under the ATM program, which takes into account the forward sale agreements in effect as of December 31, 2024. The Ameren Companies expect their equity to total capitalization and cash flow metrics to support solid investment-grade credit ratings. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois expect to fund cash flow needs through debt issuances, cash provided by operating activities, and/or capital contributions from Ameren (parent).\n•\nThe IRA was enacted in August 2022, and includes various income tax provisions, among other things. The law extends federal production and investment tax credits for projects beginning construction through 2024 and allows for a 10% adder to the production and investment tax credits for siting projects at existing energy communities as defined in the law, which includes sites previously used for coal-fired generation. The law also creates clean energy tax credits for projects beginning construction after 2024. The clean energy tax credits will apply to renewable energy production and investments, along with certain nuclear energy production, and will be phased out beginning in 2033, at the earliest. The phase-out is triggered when greenhouse gas emissions from the electric generation industry are reduced by at least 75% from the annual 2022 emission rate or at the beginning of 2033, whichever is later. The law allows for transferability to an unrelated party for cash of up to 100% of certain tax credits generated after 2022. In addition, the law imposes a 15% minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income, as defined in the law, for corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeds $1 billion for three consecutive preceding tax years effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. Once a corporation exceeds this three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income threshold, it will be subject to the minimum tax for all future tax years. Additional regulations, interpretations, amendments, or technical corrections to or in connection with the IRA have been and are expected to be issued by the IRS or United States Department of Treasury, which may impact the timing of when the 15% minimum tax becomes applicable for Ameren as discussed below.\n•\nPursuant to the IRA discussed above, Ameren Missouri expects to transfer production and investment tax credits to unrelated parties of approximately $300 million annually on average from 2025 to 2029. Proceeds from these transfers are included in Ameren Missouri’s tracker related to production and investment tax credits allowed under the IRA or the RESRAM and are ultimately refunded to customers.\n•\nIn June 2024, the IRS issued a series of private letter rulings to another taxpayer which provided guidance on applying IRS normalization rules to the calculation of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards. The rulings concluded that for ratemaking purposes, net operating loss carryforwards should be reflected on a separate company basis and should not be reduced by payments received for the utilization of losses by other affiliates under a tax allocation agreement. While a private letter ruling issued to another taxpayer may not be relied on as precedent, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are evaluating this guidance and are addressing potential impacts of the private letter rulings with the MoPSC, ICC, and FERC. For Ameren Illinois and ATXI, these impacts could result in material reductions to their regulatory liabilities related to excess deferred income taxes resulting from the TCJA. For Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, these impacts could result in material increases to their accumulated deferred income tax assets for ratemaking purposes, which would result in overall increases to their rate bases. Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI will record the impacts, if any, upon further evaluation with their respective regulatory commissions.\n•\nAs of December 31, 2024, Ameren had $410 million in tax benefits from federal and state income tax credit carryforwards, which included $229 million of production and investment tax credits that Ameren Missouri expects to transfer to third parties, $93 million in tax benefits from federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, and $22 million in tax overpayments, refunds, and receivables, which \n72\nTable\n of Contents\nwill be utilized in future periods. Future expected income tax payments are based on expected taxable income, available income tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards, and current tax law. Expected taxable income is affected by expected capital expenditures, when property, plant, and equipment is placed in-service or retired, and the timing of regulatory reviews, among other things. Based on preliminary calculations, Ameren does not expect to be subject to the 15% minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income imposed by the IRA through 2029. Ameren expects annual federal income tax payments to be immaterial through 2029.\nThe above items could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. These strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase Ameren’s shareholder value. We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed. The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nSee Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\nACCOUNTING MATTERS\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nPreparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. These estimates involve judgments regarding many factors that in and of themselves could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures. We have outlined below the critical accounting estimates that we believe are the most difficult, subjective, or complex. Any change in the assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters, among others, could have a material impact on future financial results.\nAccounting Estimate\nUncertainties Affecting Application\nRegulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery\nWe defer costs and recognize revenues that we intend to collect in future rates.\n•\nRegulatory environment and external regulatory decisions and requirements\n•\nAnticipated future regulatory decisions and our assessment of their impact\n•\nThe impact of prudence reviews, complaint cases, limitations on electric rate increases in Missouri and Illinois, and opposition during the ratemaking process that may limit our ability to timely recover costs and earn a fair return on our investments\n•\nAmeren Illinois’ assessment of and ability to estimate the current year’s electric distribution service costs to be reflected in revenues and recovered from customers in a subsequent year under the MYRP process, which includes a revenue requirement reconciliation, which may not allow for full recovery of actual costs due to a reconciliation cap\n•\nAmeren Illinois’ and ATXI’s assessment of and ability to estimate the current year’s electric transmission service costs to be reflected in revenues and recovered from customers in a subsequent year under the FERC ratemaking frameworks\n•\nAmeren Missouri’s estimate of revenue recovery under the MEEIA plans\nBasis for Judgment\nThe application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated businesses results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates. In some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. We base our conclusion on certain factors including, but not limited to, orders issued by our regulatory commissions, enacted legislation, or historical experience, as well as discussions with legal counsel. If facts and circumstances lead us to \n73\nTable\n of Contents\nconclude that a recorded regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery or that plant assets are probable of disallowance, we record a charge to earnings, which could be material. Regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or that are probable of future refunds to customers. We also recognize revenues for alternative revenue programs authorized by our regulators that allow for an automatic rate adjustment, are probable of recovery or refund, and are collected or refunded within 24 months following the end of the annual period in which they are recognized. Under the MYRP, Ameren Illinois' base rates for a particular calendar year are based on the forecasts of recoverable costs, average annual rate base, and capital structure. An ICC-determined ROE is applied to determine the base rates for a particular calendar year. Ameren Illinois will reconcile its actual revenue requirement, as adjusted for certain cost variations, to ICC-approved electric distribution service rates on an annual basis, subject to a reconciliation cap. The reconciliation cap limits the annual adjustment to 105% of the annual revenue requirement approved by the ICC. Orders by the ICC can result in a subsequent change in Ameren Illinois’ resulting estimated regulatory assets or liabilities. Ameren Illinois and ATXI have received FERC approval to use a company-specific, forward-looking formula ratemaking framework in setting their transmission rates. These forward-looking rates are updated annually and become effective each January with forecasted information. The formula rate framework provides for an annual reconciliation of the electric transmission service revenue requirement, which reflects the actual recoverable costs incurred and the 13-month average rate base for a given year, with the revenue requirement in customer rates, including an allowed ROE. Variations in investments made or orders by the FERC or courts can result in a subsequent change in Ameren Illinois’ and ATXI’s estimated regulatory assets or liabilities. Ameren Missouri estimates lost electric revenues resulting from its MEEIA customer energy-efficiency programs, which are subsequently recovered through the MEEIA rider.

In making the determination as to the amount of potential loss and the probability of loss, we consider the nature of the litigation, the claim or assessment, opinions or views of legal counsel, and the expected outcome of potential litigation, among other things. If no estimate is better than another within our range of estimates, we record as our best estimate of a loss the minimum value of our estimated range of outcomes. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to the contingency and revise our estimates. The amount recorded for any contingency may differ from actual costs incurred when the contingency is ultimately resolved. Contingencies are normally resolved over long periods of time. In our evaluation of legal matters, management consults with legal counsel and relies on analysis of relevant case law and legal precedents. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 9 – Callaway Energy Center, and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for information on the Ameren Companies’ contingencies.\nAccounting Estimate\nUncertainties Affecting Application\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe record a provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets, if any.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded to represent future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the basis of assets for financial reporting and tax purposes. Although management believes that current estimates for deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons, including: a change in forecasted financial condition and/or results of operations; changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates or amounts subject to income tax; the form, structure, and timing of asset or stock sales or dispositions; changes in the regulatory treatment of any tax reform benefits; and changes resulting from audits and examinations by taxing authorities. Valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when management concludes it is more likely than not such asset will not be realized in future periods. Accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits for positions taken, or expected to be taken on tax returns that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. Management evaluates each position solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming that the position will be examined by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine recognition thresholds and the related amount of tax benefits to be recognized. At each period end, and as new developments occur, management reevaluates its tax positions. Additional interpretations, regulations, amendments, or technical corrections related to the federal income tax code as a result of the IRA, may impact the estimates for income taxes discussed above. See Note 12 – Income Taxes under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on the IRA and the amount of deferred income taxes recorded at December 31, 2024.\nAccounting Estimate\nUncertainties Affecting Application\nAccounting for Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe record the estimated fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\n•\nDiscount rates\n•\nCost escalation rates\n•\nChanges in regulation, expected scope of work, technology, or timing of environmental remediation\n•\nEstimates as to the probability, timing, or amount of cash expenditures associated with AROs\nBasis for Judgment\nWe record the estimated fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which the liabilities are incurred and capitalize a corresponding amount as part of the book value of the related long-lived asset. In subsequent periods, we adjust AROs for accretion and changes in the estimated fair values of the obligations, with a corresponding increase or decrease in the asset book value for the fair value changes. We estimate the fair value of our AROs using present value techniques, in which we make various assumptions about discount rates and cost escalation rates. In addition, these estimates include assumptions of the probability, timing, and amount of cash expenditures to settle the ARO, and are based on currently available technology. Ameren and Ameren Missouri have recorded AROs for retirement costs associated with decommissioning of Ameren Missouri’s Callaway and wind renewable energy centers, certain Ameren Missouri solar energy centers, CCR facilities, and river structures at certain energy centers used for unloading coal and circulating water systems. Additionally, Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois have recorded AROs for retirement costs associated with asbestos removal and the disposal of certain transformers. See Note 15 – Supplemental Information under Part II, Item 8, of this report for the amount of AROs recorded at December 31, 2024.\nA significant portion of Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s AROs relate to the decommissioning of Ameren Missouri’s Callaway Energy Center. Changes in key assumptions could materially affect the decommissioning obligation. The following table reflects the sensitivity of potential changes in key assumptions to Ameren Missouri’s Callaway Energy Center decommissioning obligation as of December 31, 2024:\nChange in Callaway Energy Center’s Key ARO Assumptions\nIncrease (Decrease) to ARO\nDiscount rate decreased by 0.10%\n$\n12 \nCost escalation rate increased by 0.25%\n28 \nIncrease in the estimated decommissioning costs by 10%\n47 \nTwo-year deferral in timing of cash expenditures\n(31)\nImpact of New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.\n76\nTable\n of Contents",
