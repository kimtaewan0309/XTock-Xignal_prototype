MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read together with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, and in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company’s business, operations and financial performance. The cautionary statements made in this Form 10-Q should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements whenever they appear in this Form 10-Q. The Company’s actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those that are discussed under “Forward-Looking Statements” and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The Company has a disclosure committee consisting of members of senior management and other key employees involved in the preparation of the Company’s SEC reports. The disclosure committee is actively involved in the review and discussion of the Company’s SEC filings.\nOverview\nAmerican Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. The Company’s primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers, collectively presented as the “Regulated Businesses.” Services provided by the Company’s utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as public utility commissions (“PUCs”). The Company also operates other businesses not subject to economic regulation by state PUCs that provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities, collectively presented throughout this Form 10-Q within “Other.” See Part I, Item 1—Business in the Company’s Form 10-K for additional information.\nFinancial Results\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, diluted earnings per share, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), were $1.94 and $4.47, respectively, compared to $1.80 and $4.17 per share in the same periods in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by the implementation of new rates in the Regulated Businesses from the recovery of capital and acquisition investments. Results also reflect increased operating costs and higher depreciation and financing costs to support the current capital investment plan. Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, reflect the net impact of weather compared to normal, estimated at $0.03 favorable and flat per share, respectively. Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflect the net favorable impact of warmer, drier weather compared to normal, estimated at $0.04 and $0.07 per share, respectively.\nGrowth Through Capital Investment in Infrastructure and Regulated Acquisitions\nThe Company continues to grow its businesses, with the substantial majority of its growth to be achieved in the Regulated Businesses through (i) continued capital investment in the Company’s infrastructure to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to its customers, (ii) regulated acquisitions to expand the Company’s services to new customers and (iii) organic growth in existing systems. The Company currently plans to invest approximately $3.2 billion in these growth strategies in 2025. During the first nine months of 2025,\n \nthe Company invested $2.2 billion, in the Regulated Businesses, as discussed below.\n•\n$2.1 billion capital investment in the Regulated Businesses for infrastructure improvements and replacements; and\n•\n$30 million to fund acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses, which added approximately 11,000 customers. This includes the Company’s acquisition effective May 28, 2025, of all the outstanding capital stock of Audubon Water Company, for total consideration of $7 million in the form of shares of parent company common stock.\n•\nApproximately 14,600 new customers were added through organic growth in existing systems.\nExcluding the Essential Merger Agreement (as defined below), as of September 30, 2025, the Company had entered into 24 agreements with a total aggregate purchase price of $572 million for pending acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses to add approximately 98,000 additional customers.\n41\nTable of Contents\nExecution of Agreement and Plan of Merger with Essential\nOn October 26, 2025, parent company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Essential (the “Essential Merger Agreement”) to combine the two companies in a stock-for-stock transaction. The Essential Merger Agreement provides that, upon the completion of the proposed merger, Essential’s shareholders will receive 0.305 shares of parent company common stock in exchange for each share of Essential common stock eligible for exchange in the merger. Upon completion of the proposed merger, Essential will be a wholly owned subsidiary of parent company, which will retain its existing name and remain headquartered in Camden, New Jersey.\n \nThe Company will continue to maintain substantial operations in Pennsylvania, including Essential’s offices in Bryn Mawr and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nCompletion of the proposed merger is subject to certain customary conditions, including, among others, approvals by each of parent company’s and Essential’s shareholders, the receipt of required approvals from all applicable PUCs on such terms and conditions that would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Burdensome Effect (as defined in the Essential Merger Agreement), and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. There can be no guarantee that all of the closing conditions and approvals will be satisfied, and the failure to complete the proposed merger on a timely basis or at all may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Company currently estimates that the closing of the proposed merger will occur by the end of the first quarter of 2027.\nExecution of Purchase and Sale Agreement with Nexus Regulated Utilities, LLC\nOn May 19, 2025, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Nexus Regulated Utilities, LLC (“Seller”), a subsidiary of Nexus Water Group, Inc., a privately-held water and wastewater utility. Seller directly owns all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in specified entities (collectively, the “Acquired Entities”) that own regulated water and wastewater system assets located in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to acquire from Seller all of Seller’s equity interests in each of the Acquired Entities on a cash-free and debt-free basis. The aggregate purchase price to be paid by the Company will be approximately $315 million in cash, subject to adjustment at closing based on the calculations and criteria provided in the Purchase Agreement. Aggregate rate base that would be acquired at closing is estimated to be approximately $200 million, subject to final determination by the respective PUCs. Based on current connection counts, the Company would add nearly 47,000 customer connections in total to its Regulated Businesses in the eight states above. The Company intends to fund the payment of the final purchase price through its cash flow from operations and its existing sources of liquidity. Closing is subject to certain customary and other conditions, including, among others, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The Company currently anticipates that the closing will occur by or before August 2026.\nOther Matters\nCybersecurity Incident Update\nPrior to filing a consolidated complaint, the plaintiffs in the putative consolidated class action lawsuit against parent company related to the Company’s October 2024 cybersecurity incident agreed to voluntarily dismiss their consolidated Federal court lawsuit without prejudice. An order of voluntary dismissal was entered on March 24, 2025, which concludes this lawsuit against parent company. \nPFAS Multi-District Litigation \nSeveral of the Company’s utility subsidiaries are parties to a multi-district litigation (the “MDL”) lawsuit, which commenced on December 7, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, against manufacturers of certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (collectively, “PFAS”) for damages, contribution and reimbursement of costs incurred and continuing to be incurred to address the presence of such PFAS in public water supply systems owned and operated by these utility subsidiaries and throughout their service areas. Settlements with several defendants in the MDL have received final approval by the MDL court. During the third quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, the Company timely submitted to the MDL court its Phase One claim forms under settlement agreements with defendants 3M Company, The Chemours Company, Corteva, Inc., DuPont de Nemours, Inc., Tyco Fire Products LP and BASF Corporation.\nAs of September 30, 2025, the Company has received settlement payments from defendant 3M Company totaling $135 million, net of legal fees and administrative costs. The Company intends to seek regulatory approval from its respective PUCs to apply the net proceeds for the benefit of customers. As of September 30, 2025, these funds are being held in a law firm escrow account and are awaiting distribution to the Company’s utility subsidiaries that are parties to the MDL after receiving approval from the applicable PUCs. The funds have been recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet within other current assets, as of September 30, 2025. A corresponding amount has been recorded as a regulatory liability given that the Company intends to seek appropriate regulatory approvals as noted above. The Company anticipates that, during the remainder of 2025, it may receive one or more additional settlement payments from the defendants named above.\n42\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has also become aware of a number of substantially similar personal injury short-form complaints that had been filed in the MDL naming, in addition to various other water providers and manufacturers, certain Company utility subsidiaries as defendants. The Company believes that the claims asserted are without merit and the relevant utility subsidiaries have valid, meritorious defenses to the claims. In October 2025, all MDL personal injury complaints that the Company had been made aware of were dismissed by the plaintiffs without prejudice.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety, and Water Quality Regulation\nOn April 10, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) announced a final National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (“NPDWR”) for six PFAS including PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, PFHxS, and PFBS. The NPDWR for PFAS establishes legally enforceable levels, called maximum contaminant levels, for PFAS in drinking water. Utilities will be required to complete their initial monitoring for PFAS by 2027, followed by ongoing compliance monitoring. Although the EPA has indicated their intent to extend the compliance deadline to 2031, under the current rule utilities will be required to comply with the new MCLs by April 2029, implementing solutions to reduce PFAS levels where needed. Beginning in April 2029, utilities that exceed any of the PFAS MCLs will be required to provide notification to the public of the violation.\nUpon initial review of the compliance requirements in 2024, the Company estimated an investment of approximately $1 billion of capital expenditures to install additional treatment facilities in order to comply with the new regulations by April 2029. The Company currently estimates an investment of approximately $2 billion of capital expenditures to install additional treatment facilities in order to comply with the NPDWR as proposed.\nRegulatory Matters\nGeneral Rate Cases\nThe table below summarizes the annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from general rate case authorizations that are effective during 2025. The amounts include reductions for the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (“EADIT”) that are generally offset in income tax expense.\n(In millions)\nEffective Date\nAmount\nGeneral rate cases by state:\nHawaii\nAugust 1, 2025\n$\n1 \nIowa\nAugust 1, 2025 (a)\n13 \nMissouri\nMay 28, 2025\n63 \nIndiana, Step Increase\nMay 14, 2025\n17 \nVirginia\nFebruary 24, 2025 (b)\n15 \nTennessee\nJanuary 21, 2025\n1 \nIllinois\nJanuary 1, 2025\n105 \nCalifornia, Step Increase\nJanuary 1, 2025\n17 \nTotal general rate case authorizations\n$\n232 \n(a)\nInterim rates of $5 million were effective May 11, 2024. The Iowa Utilities Commission issued its final order on May 21, 2025.\n(b)\nInterim rates were effective May 1, 2024, and the difference between interim and final approved rates were subject to refund. The Virginia State Corporation Commission issued its final order on February 24, 2025.\nOn July 24, 2025, the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission issued a final order adopting the settlement agreement filed by the Company’s Hawaii subsidiary on April 25, 2025, with respect to its general rate case filed on August 2, 2024. The final order approves an annualized increase of approximately $1 million in wastewater revenue, which is based on a return on equity of 9.75% and a capital structure with an equity component of 52.11% and a debt component of 47.89%. New rates were effective August 1, 2025.\nOn May 21, 2025, the Iowa Utilities Commission issued a final order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a general rate case originally filed on May 1, 2024, by the Company’s Iowa subsidiary. The general rate case order approved a $13 million annualized increase in water and wastewater system revenues, excluding infrastructure surcharges of $1 million, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.60%, authorized rate base of $262 million, and a capital structure with a common equity component of 52.57% and a long-term debt component of 47.43%. The requested annualized revenue increase was driven primarily by over $157 million of capital investments made and expected to be made by the Iowa subsidiary through March 2026. Interim rates of $5 million were effective May 11, 2024, with the remaining increase in annualized water and wastewater system revenues of $8 million effective on August 1, 2025.\n43\nTable of Contents\nOn May 14, 2025, the Company’s Indiana subsidiary’s third step increase of $17 million in annualized water and wastewater system revenues became effective. The Indiana subsidiary filed the general rate case on March 31, 2023, and on February 14, 2024, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (the “IURC”) issued an order that approved a $65 million annualized increase in water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges. The annualized revenue increase included three step increases, with $25 million of the increase included in rates in February 2024, $23 million in May 2024, and $17 million in May 2025.\nOn May 7, 2025, the Missouri Public Service Commission (the “MoPSC”) issued an order approving without modification the stipulation and agreement (the “Stipulation”) with respect to a general rate case filed on July 1, 2024, by the Company’s Missouri subsidiary. The Stipulation was entered into on March 17, 2025, with parties including the staff of the MoPSC and the Office of the Public Counsel. The general rate case order approves a $63 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues, excluding $63 million in infrastructure surcharges. The requested annualized revenue increase was driven primarily by $1.1 billion of capital investments completed by the Missouri subsidiary from January 2023 through May 2025. For purposes of the general rate case, the Missouri subsidiary’s view of its rate base is $3.2 billion, and its view as to its return on equity and common equity ratio (each of which has been determined based on the order but was not disclosed therein) is 9.75% and 50.00%, respectively.\nOn February 24, 2025, the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the “VSCC”) issued an order approving the September 19, 2024 joint “black box” settlement of the general rate case filed by the Company’s Virginia subsidiary. The general rate case order approves the stipulated $15 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues. Interim water and wastewater rates became effective May 1, 2024, with the difference between interim and final approved rates subject to refund. The requested annualized revenue increase was driven primarily by more than $110 million of incremental capital investments made between May 2023 and April 2025. For purposes of the general rate case, the Virginia subsidiary’s view of its rate base is $369 million. The general rate case order also approved, solely for purposes of the Virginia subsidiary’s future filings requiring a stated cost of capital and/or capital structure (including its annual information and water and wastewater infrastructure surcharge filings), a return on equity of 9.70% and a capital structure consisting of an equity component of 45.67% and a debt and other component of 54.33%, which also represents the Virginia subsidiary’s view of its return on equity and capital structure in this general rate case. \nOn January 21, 2025, the Tennessee Public Utility Commission (the “TPUC”) approved a motion authorizing an adjustment of water base rates requested in a rate case filed on May 1, 2024, by the Company’s Tennessee subsidiary. The TPUC approved an increase of $1 million in annualized revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $18 million, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.70%, authorized rate base of approximately $300 million, a common equity ratio of 44.19% and a debt ratio of 55.81%. This adjustment took effect on January 21, 2025, and is driven primarily by approximately $173 million in capital investments completed and planned by the Tennessee subsidiary through December 2025.\nOn January 14, 2025, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) granted the Company’s California subsidiary’s request for a one-year extension of its cost of capital filing to May 1, 2026, to set its authorized cost of capital beginning January 1, 2027, and maintain its current authorized cost of capital through 2026.\nOn December 5, 2024, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued a final order approving the adjustment of base rates requested in a rate case originally filed on January 25, 2024, by the Company’s Illinois subsidiary. The general rate case order approved an increase of $105 million in annualized water and wastewater system revenues, excluding previously recovered infrastructure surcharges of $5 million, based on an authorized return on equity of 9.84%, authorized rate base of $2.2 billion, and a capital structure with an equity component of 49.00% and a debt component of 51.00%. The increase was effective January 1, 2025, and is driven primarily by approximately $557 million in capital investments completed and planned by the Illinois subsidiary from January 2024 through December 2025.\n44\nTable of Contents\nOn December 5, 2024, the CPUC approved a final decision adopting the terms of a partial settlement agreement filed on November 17, 2023, in the Company’s California subsidiary’s general rate case originally filed on July 1, 2022. Incorporating the then currently effective return on equity of 10.20%, the decision provides incremental annualized water and wastewater revenues of $21 million in the 2024 test year, and an estimated $16 million in the 2025 escalation year and $16 million in the 2026 attrition year. The 2024 rates were implemented retroactively to January 1, 2024. In addition, the CPUC denied the California subsidiary’s proposed Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism but approved continuation of its currently effective Annual Consumption Adjustment Mechanism. On December 12, 2024, the California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the CPUC’s denial of the proposed Water Resources Sustainability Plan decoupling mechanism, and on May 23, 2025, the CPUC issued its decision denying the application for rehearing. On September 19, 2025, the California subsidiary filed a petition to modify the CPUC order received on December 5, 2024, for its general rate case originally filed on July 1, 2022. The request seeks clarification from the CPUC on the method used to calculate the Conservation Adjustment for Rate Tier Designs (“CART”), specifically for the California subsidiary’s Monterey service area. The CART is a ratemaking mechanism that allows the Company to recover, in subsequent periods, a portion of the impact on operating revenues as a result of implementing customer rates structured to promote conservation usage. On October 20, 2025, the California Public Advocate submitted a response opposing the California subsidiary’s request and stating the request should instead be addressed in the California subsidiary’s pending base rate case. The California subsidiary has requested an opportunity to formally reply. The CPUC will consider both positions, and the California subsidiary expects resolution of the petition to modify later in 2026.\nPending General Rate Case Filings\nOn August 1, 2025, the Company’s Maryland subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $3 million in annualized incremental revenues, which is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.64% and a capital structure with an equity component of 52.32%. The requested annualized incremental revenue is driven primarily by approximately $22 million of capital investments completed by the Maryland subsidiary from February 2019 through April 2025. The filing must be approved by the Public Service Commission of Maryland, and if approved, it is anticipated that new rates would take effect in March 2026.\nOn July 1, 2025, the Company’s California subsidiary filed an application with the CPUC to set new water and wastewater rates in each of its service areas for 2027 through 2029. The application requested an increase of $63 million compared to authorized 2025 revenue, and a total increase in revenue over the 2027 to 2029 period of $111 million. On October 13, 2025, the California subsidiary filed its 100 day update for the same proceeding and updated the request to $62 million compared to authorized 2025 revenue, and a total increase in revenue over the 2027 to 2029 period of $110 million. The requested annualized incremental revenue is driven primarily by approximately $750 million of capital investments completed and planned by the California subsidiary through 2025 to 2028. If approved by the CPUC, the new rates would take effect on January 1, 2027. The application also requests approval of a Fixed Cost Recovery Account, which is intended to be a full decoupling mechanism that would allow the California subsidiary to recover authorized fixed costs, regardless of sales volume, while also providing incentives, via progressive conservation-oriented rate design, for customers to use water more efficiently. Independent of the pending rate case, California Senate Bill 473, which would have required the CPUC to ensure variances between forecasted and actual sales do not result in material overcollections or undercollections by water corporations, passed out of the California Senate but did not advance in the California Assembly Appropriations Committee.\nOn May 16, 2025, the Company’s Kentucky subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $27 million in annualized incremental revenues, excluding infrastructure surcharges of $10 million, which is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.75% and a proposed capital structure with a common equity component of 52.26% and a debt component of 47.74%. The requested annualized incremental revenue is being driven primarily by approximately $212 million of capital investments completed and planned by the Kentucky subsidiary from February 2025 through December 2026. As provided by statutory authority, the Kentucky subsidiary may put into effect proposed rates on an interim basis seven months after the filing of this case, or December 16, 2025, and the difference between the interim and final approved rates will be subject to refund. The request is subject to approval by the Kentucky Public Service Commission, and the general rate case is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2026.\nOn May 5, 2025, the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting approximately $48 million in aggregate annualized incremental revenues, excluding infrastructure surcharges of $13 million, which would include two step increases, with $33 million to be included in rates in March 2026, and $15 million to be included in rates in March 2027. The request is based on a proposed return on equity of 10.75% and a capital structure with an equity component of 50.80% and 50.97%, respectively, for each of the two steps. The requested annualized incremental revenue is driven primarily by more than $300 million of capital investments completed and planned by the West Virginia subsidiary from March 2024 through February 2027. The request is subject to approval by the Public Service Commission of West Virginia, and the general rate case is expected to be completed by the end of February 2026.\n45\nTable of Contents\nInfrastructure Surcharges\nA number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and investments, such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure. Presented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant sales volume and customer count, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective during 2025:\n(In millions)\nEffective Date\nAmount\nInfrastructure surcharges by state:\nPennsylvania\nOctober 1, 2025\n$\n5 \nNew Jersey\nMay 30, 2025\n15 \nMissouri\nFebruary 7, 2025\n17 \nKentucky\nJanuary 1, 2025\n2 \nWest Virginia\nJanuary 1, 2025\n4 \nTotal infrastructure surcharge authorizations\n$\n43 \nPending Infrastructure Surcharge Filings\nOn September 3, 2025, the Company’s Missouri subsidiary filed an infrastructure surcharge proceeding requesting $13 million in additional annualized revenues.\nOn June 30, 2025, the Company’s West Virginia subsidiary filed an infrastructure surcharge proceeding requesting $3 million in additional annualized revenues.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nThe Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (the “PaPUC”), as part of its July 22, 2024, approval of the general rate case filed by the Company’s Pennsylvania subsidiary on November 8, 2023, initiated an investigation into certain reported water service and water quality issues in the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s Northeastern service territory, which reports had been provided during public input hearings convened in the general rate case. The PaPUC concluded the investigation and issued a Root Cause Analysis Report on August 5, 2025, which found no systemic issues affecting the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s water service in the Northeastern service territory and expressed satisfaction with the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s efforts to manage water service matters. The PaPUC committed to continued monitoring of the Pennsylvania subsidiary’s service over the next three years.\n46\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nPresented in the table below are the Company’s consolidated results of operations:\n \nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nOperating revenues\n$\n1,451 \n$\n1,323 \n$\n3,869 \n$\n3,483 \nOperating expenses:\nOperation and maintenance\n523 \n496 \n1,471 \n1,339 \nDepreciation and amortization\n226 \n200 \n663 \n581 \nGeneral taxes\n87 \n84 \n260 \n246 \nOther\n1 \n— \n1 \n(1)\nTotal operating expenses, net\n837 \n780 \n2,395 \n2,165 \nOperating income\n614 \n543 \n1,474 \n1,318 \nOther (expense) income:\nInterest expense \n(158)\n(132)\n(453)\n(387)\nInterest income\n23 \n22 \n67 \n71 \nNon-operating benefit costs, net\n4 \n7 \n12 \n23 \nOther, net\n11 \n13 \n40 \n31 \nTotal other (expense) income\n(120)\n(90)\n(334)\n(262)\nIncome before income taxes\n494 \n453 \n1,140 \n1,056 \nProvision for income taxes\n115 \n103 \n267 \n244 \nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n$\n379 \n$\n350 \n$\n873 \n$\n812 \nSegment Results of Operations\nThe Company’s operating segments are comprised of its businesses which generate revenue, incur expense and have separate financial information which is regularly used by the chief operating decision maker to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its business primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment.

In addition, operating revenues increased $12 million and $37 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, from water and wastewater acquisitions, as well as organic growth in existing systems. Operating revenues were also higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, in the Company’s California subsidiary, due to a change to its revenue stability mechanism from full to partial revenue recovery, resulting from the general rate case decision approved by the CPUC in December 2024. These increases were partially offset by an estimated $3 million and $20 million net decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, due to unfavorable weather impacts in 2025 as compared to 2024.\n48\nTable of Contents\nOperation and Maintenance\nPresented in the table below is information regarding the main components of the Regulated Businesses’ operation and maintenance expense:\n \nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nEmployee-related costs\n$\n142 \n$\n134 \n$\n431 \n$\n405 \nProduction costs\n142 \n133 \n365 \n344 \nOperating supplies and services\n77 \n72 \n233 \n196 \nMaintenance materials and supplies\n26 \n25 \n81 \n66 \nCustomer billing and accounting\n27 \n20 \n69 \n48 \nOther\n19 \n18 \n55 \n50 \nTotal operation and maintenance expense\n$\n433 \n$\n402 \n$\n1,234 \n$\n1,109 \n \nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, operation and maintenance expense increased $31 million and $125 million, respectively, due to increases from employee-related costs, increased operating supplies and services costs primarily from higher technology related costs, increased production costs primarily from higher purchased water cost and power and fuel costs, customer billing and accounting from an increase in customer uncollectible expense and increases in other maintenance costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, depreciation and amortization increased $28 million and $85 million, respectively, primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service from capital infrastructure investments and higher depreciation rates from recent rate case orders.\nGeneral Taxes\n For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, general taxes increased $3 million and $12 million, respectively, primarily due to incremental property taxes, higher capital stock taxes and New Jersey Gross Receipts Tax.\nOther Expenses\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, other expenses increased $24 million and $62 million, respectively, primarily due to higher interest expense from the issuance of incremental long-term debt.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Regulated Businesses’ provision for income taxes increased $10 million and $23 million, respectively. The Regulated Businesses’ effective income tax rate was 22.6% and 22.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and 22.7% and 22.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the decrease in the amortization of EADIT pursuant to regulatory orders.\n49\nTable of Contents\nOther\nPresented in the table below is information for Other:\n \nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nOperating revenues\n$\n108 \n$\n104 \n$\n299 \n$\n279 \nOperation and maintenance\n90 \n94 \n237 \n230 \nDepreciation and amortization\n2 \n4 \n9 \n12 \nGeneral taxes\n5 \n5 \n16 \n14 \nInterest expense\n(36)\n(25)\n(101)\n(81)\nInterest income\n22 \n16 \n64 \n57 \nOther income\n2 \n3 \n12 \n9 \nProvision for income taxes\n3 \n1 \n11 \n11 \nNet (loss) income attributable to common shareholders\n$\n(4)\n$\n(6)\n$\n1 \n$\n(3)\nOperating Revenues\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, operating revenues increased $4 million and $20 million, respectively, primarily from an increase in capital projects in MSG and the Contract Services Group (“CSG”).\nOperation and Maintenance\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, operation and maintenance expense decreased $4 million, primarily due to reduced employee-related costs partially offset by increased costs associated with MSG and CSG projects.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, operation and maintenance expense increased $7 million, primarily due to increased costs associated with MSG and CSG projects partially offset by reduced employee-related costs.\nInterest expense\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, interest expense increased $11 million and $20 million, respectively, due to higher average commercial paper borrowings.\nLegislative Updates\nDuring 2025, the Company’s regulatory jurisdictions enacted the following legislation that has been approved and is effective as of October 29, 2025:\n•\nCalifornia passed Senate Bill 219, which amends the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, to allow the California Air Resources Board until July 1, 2025, to issue implementing regulations, including reporting requirements for Scope 3 emissions. Legislation was signed by the Governor on September 27, 2024, and became effective January 1, 2025.\n•\nVirginia passed Senate Bill 850, which would permit a water or wastewater utility to petition the VSCC for the approval of an eligible infrastructure replacement and enhancement plan and accompanying recovery mechanism that allows for recovery of eligible infrastructure costs outside of a base rate case. Legislation was signed by the Governor on March 24, 2025, and became effective on July 1, 2025.\n•\nIndiana passed Senate Bill 426, which changes the timing of recovery to allow for deferred depreciation from in-service date and post in-service carrying costs and authorizes the IURC to approve mechanisms to allow utilities to invest in and earn on acquired utility assets. The language also provides critical protections from lawsuits when utilities are meeting applicable water quality standards. Legislation was signed by the Governor on April 3, 2025, and became effective on July 1, 2025.\n•\nMissouri passed Senate Bill 4, which provides that beginning July 1, 2026, water, sewer, and gas utilities may request the use of a future test year in a general rate case. This statute provides that at the end of the future test year, utilities must reconcile rate base and certain expenses, including annualized depreciation expense, income tax expense, payroll expense, employee benefits except for pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and rate case expenses, within 45 days to the MoPSC. Legislation was signed by the Governor on April 9, 2025, and became effective on August 28, 2025.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCondemnation and Eminent Domain\nAll or portions of the Regulated Businesses’ utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original certificate of public convenience and necessity (“CPCN”) was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its CPCN. The acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or the jurisdiction of the particular CPCN.\nAs such, the Regulated Businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, the Monterey system assets of Cal Am are the subject of a condemnation lawsuit filed by the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the “MPWMD”) stemming from a November 2018 public ballot initiative. For more information on this matter, see Part II, Item 1—Legal Proceedings—Proposed Acquisition of Monterey System Assets — Potential Condemnation and Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFurthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which the Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, for example, lawsuits have been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates, but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses, although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance.\nTax Matters\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBB”) was signed into law. The OBBB includes several corporate tax-related provisions. Key changes include the permanent extension of certain provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, such as 100% bonus depreciation and Section 163(j) interest limitation exception for regulated utilities, as well as the immediate expensing of domestic research and development costs, and the introduction of a new charitable contribution floor for corporations. The OBBB has not had a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company will continue to monitor the implementation and any related guidance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor a general overview of the sources and uses of capital resources, see the introductory discussion in Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Company’s Form 10-K.\nLiquidity needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are generally funded through cash flows from operations, public and private debt offerings, issuances of commercial paper and equity and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under the revolving credit facility of American Water Capital Corp., the Company’s wholly owned finance subsidiary.\nThe Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash flows from operating activities, the Company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next five years through a combination of long-term debt and equity issuances, in addition to the remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS. The remaining proceeds from the sale of HOS include receipt of payments under a secured seller promissory note, plus interest, see Note 5—Acquisitions and Divestitures—Secured Seller Promissory Note from the Sale of Homeowner Services Group, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. If necessary, the Company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. In this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time.\n51\nTable of Contents\nIn August 2025, the Company entered into separate forward sale agreements (the “Forward Sale Agreements”) with several forward purchasers relating to an aggregate of 8,098,592 shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial forward price of $139.657 per share, which is equal to the price to public per share less an underwriting discount. Each Forward Sale Agreement will be physically settled unless the Company elects to settle such Forward Sale Agreement in cash or to net share settle such Forward Sale Agreement (which the Company has the right to do, subject to certain conditions, other than in the limited circumstances set forth in the Forward Sale Agreements). The Forward Sale Agreements provide for settlement on a settlement date or dates to be specified at the Company’s discretion on or prior to December 31, 2026. To the extent the Forward Sale Agreements are physically settled, the Company will issue common stock to the forward purchasers and receive cash proceeds based on the applicable forward sale price on the settlement date as defined in the Forward Sale Agreements.\nAs of September 30, 2025, the Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of its common stock connected to the Forward Sale Agreements. The Company estimates that it will receive total net proceeds of approximately $1,131 million, before deducting estimated offering expenses, subject to the price adjustment and other provisions of the Forward Sale Agreements, in the event of full physical settlement of all of the Forward Sale Agreements. The Company intends to use any net cash proceeds that it may receive upon a settlement of the Forward Sale Agreements for general corporate purposes. The Forward Sale Agreements will be classified as equity transactions because they are indexed to the Company’s common stock and physical settlement is within the Company’s control.\nOn August 8, 2025, AWCC completed the sale of $900 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.700% Senior Notes due 2055. At the closing of this offering, AWCC received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $887 million. AWCC used the net proceeds of the offering (i) to lend funds to American Water and the Regulated Businesses; (ii) to repay commercial paper obligations of AWCC; and (iii) for general corporate purposes.\nOn February 27, 2025, AWCC completed the sale of $800 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.250% Senior Notes due 2035. At the closing of this offering, AWCC received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $792 million. AWCC used the net proceeds of the offering (i) to lend funds to American Water and the Regulated Businesses; (ii) to repay at maturity AWCC’s 3.400% Senior Notes due 2025; (iii) to repay commercial paper obligations of AWCC; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.\nOn June 29, 2023, AWCC issued $1,035 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). The Notes will mature on June 15, 2026, unless earlier exchanged or repurchased, and are included in Current portion of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAWCC’s revolving credit facility provides $2.75 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions. The revolving credit facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support, and to provide a sub-limit for the issuance of up to $150 million in letters of credit. The maximum aggregate principal amount of short-term borrowings authorized for issuance under AWCC’s commercial paper program is $2.6 billion. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment by up to an aggregate of $500 million.\nPresented in the tables below are the aggregate credit facility commitments, commercial paper limit and letter of credit availability under the revolving credit facility, as well as the available capacity for each:\nAs of September 30, 2025\n(In millions)\nCommercial Paper Limit\nLetters of Credit\nTotal (a)\nTotal availability\n$\n2,600 \n$\n150 \n$\n2,750 \nOutstanding debt\n(1,005)\n(84)\n(1,089)\nRemaining availability as of September 30, 2025\n$\n1,595 \n$\n66 \n$\n1,661 \n(a)\nTotal remaining availability of $1.7 billion as of September 30, 2025, was accessible through revolver draws.\n52\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nCommercial Paper Limit\nLetters of Credit\nTotal (a)\nTotal availability\n$\n2,600 \n$\n150 \n$\n2,750 \nOutstanding debt\n(880)\n(82)\n(962)\nRemaining availability as of December 31, 2024\n$\n1,720 \n$\n68 \n$\n1,788 \n(a)\nTotal remaining availability of \n$1.8 billion\n as of December 31, 2024, was accessible through revolver draws.\nPresented in the table below is the Company’s total available liquidity:\n(In millions)\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAvailability on Revolving Credit Facility\nTotal Available Liquidity\nAvailable liquidity as of September 30, 2025\n$\n166 \n$\n1,661 \n$\n1,827 \nAvailable liquidity as of December 31, 2024\n$\n96 \n$\n1,788 \n$\n1,884 \n The weighted-average interest rate on AWCC’s outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 4.26% and 4.65% at September 30, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nThe Company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets, the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the Company’s short-term requirements. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. However, there can be no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility, or that AWCC will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all.\n \nSee Note 8—Short-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAs of September 30, 2025, the Company had two treasury lock agreements, with a term of 10 years and 30 years and an aggregate notional amount totaling $100 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on expected future debt issuances. These treasury lock agreements terminate in June 2026 and September 2026 and have an average fixed interest rate of 4.55%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, measured at fair value with the gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nIn May 2025 and August 2025, the Company terminated two and nine treasury lock agreements, respectively, designated as cash flow hedges, with a term of 30 years and an aggregate notional amount totaling $100 million and $350 million, respectively, realizing a pre-tax net gain of $12 million and $1 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The gain will be amortized through Interest expense over a 30-year period, in accordance with the tenor of the notes issued on August 8, 2025.\nIn February 2025, the Company terminated 10 treasury lock agreements designated as cash flow hedges, with a term of 10 years and an aggregate notional amount totaling $500 million, realizing a pre-tax net gain of $3 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The gain will be amortized through Interest expense over a 10-year period, in accordance with the tenor of the notes issued on February 27, 2025.\nNo ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 or 2024.\n53\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of demand, are generally greater during the warmer months. Presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Company’s cash flows from operating activities:\n \nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\nNet income\n$\n873 \n$\n812 \nAdd (less):\nDepreciation and amortization\n663 \n581 \nDeferred income taxes and amortization of investment tax credits\n104 \n84 \nOther non-cash activities (a)\n31 \n28 \nChanges in assets and liabilities (b)\n(242)\n(66)\nPension contributions\n(33)\n(33)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,396 \n$\n1,406 \n(a)\nIncludes provision for losses on accounts receivable, pension and non-pension postretirement benefits and other non-cash, net. \n(b)\nChanges in assets and liabilities include changes to receivables and unbilled revenues, income tax receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accrued taxes and other assets and liabilities, net.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $10 million, primarily due to the CAMT liability included in the Company’s 2024 extension payment in the second quarter of 2025, utilization of income tax receivables in the prior year and higher customer receivables and unbilled revenues in the current period. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net income and depreciation.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nPresented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Company’s cash flows from investing activities:\n \nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\nCapital expenditures\n$\n(2,078)\n$\n(1,962)\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\n(22)\n(119)\nRemoval costs from property, plant and equipment retirements, net\n(120)\n(112)\nPurchases of available-for-sale fixed-income securities\n(43)\n(113)\nProceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale fixed-income securities\n84 \n147 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(2,179)\n$\n(2,159)\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, cash flows used in investing activities increased $20 million, primarily due to increased payments for capital expenditures partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions in the current period. The Company currently plans to invest approximately $3.2 billion on growth through capital investment in infrastructure and acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses in 2025. \n54\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nPresented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Company’s cash flows from financing activities:\n \nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\nProceeds from long-term debt, net of discount\n$\n1,776 \n$\n1,416 \nRepayments of long-term debt\n(623)\n(474)\nNet short-term borrowings with original maturities less than three months\n126 \n35 \nDebt issuance costs\n(17)\n(13)\nDividends paid\n(472)\n(436)\nOther financing activities, net (a)\n62 \n38 \nNet cash provided by financing activities\n$\n852 \n$\n566 \n(a)\nIncludes proceeds from issuances of common stock under various employee stock plans and the Company’s dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan, net of taxes paid, and advances and contributions in aid of construction, net of refunds.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, cash flows provided by financing activities increased $286 million, primarily due to higher issuances of long-term debt and higher short-term commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by higher repayments of long-term debt and dividend payments.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Company’s debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that the Company is not in compliance with these covenants, an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the Company, or its subsidiaries, may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access the revolving credit facility. The long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the Company from issuing debt secured by the Company’s assets, subject to certain exceptions. Failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations.\nCovenants in certain long-term notes and the revolving credit facility require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (as defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On September 30, 2025, the Company’s ratio was 0.58 to 1.00 and therefore the Company was in compliance with the covenants.\nSecurity Ratings\nPresented in the table below are long-term and short-term credit ratings and rating outlooks as of October 29, 2025, as issued by Moody’s Ratings on January 23, 2025, and S&P Global Ratings on June 6, 2025:\nSecurities\nMoody’s Ratings\nS&P Global Ratings\nRating outlook\nStable\nStable\nSenior unsecured debt\nBaa1\nA\nCommercial paper\nP-2\nA-1\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans. The Company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain its existing ratings. The Company does not have any material borrowings that are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility.\n55\nTable of Contents\nAs part of its normal course of business, the Company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, power and other fuel, chemicals and other services. These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the Company must provide collateral to secure its obligations. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nAccess to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by the Company’s securities ratings. The Company primarily accesses the debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through AWCC.
