Our generating capacity includes primarily nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric assets. Through our integrated business operations, we sell electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related products and sustainable solutions to various types of customers, including distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial, industrial, public sector, and residential customers in markets across multiple geographic regions. We have five reportable segments: Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT, and Other Power Regions.\nSignificant Transactions and Developments\nConowingo Hydroelectric Project License Renewal\nIn September 2025, we reached a settlement agreement with MDE, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association, and Waterkeepers Chesapeake, that resolves all outstanding issues related to obtaining a water quality certification from MDE. As a result, MDE issued a water quality certification, clearing the way for the re-licensing and continued operation of our Conowingo hydroelectric facility. The terms of the agreement include operational improvements and commitments for water quality and resiliency, trash and debris removal, aquatic life passage, freshwater mussel restoration, dredging and invasive species management. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters for more information.\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\nWe continue to see legislative support for nuclear energy generation, including the passage of the OBBBA. Signed into law in July 2025, the OBBBA both preserves certain federal tax credits from the IRA and enhances certain credits to allow advanced nuclear facilities to qualify for the energy communities bonus adder, subject to \n48\nTable of Contents\neligibility requirements. Overall, the OBBBA reinforces the long-term economic viability of our nuclear generation assets. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters for more information.\nClinton Clean Energy Center\nIn June 2025, we signed a 20-year PPA with Meta Platforms, Inc. (Meta) for the output of the Clinton Clean Energy Center to support Meta’s clean energy goals and operations in the region with emissions-free nuclear energy. The agreement, beginning in June 2027, supports the relicensing and continued operations of Clinton for another two decades after the state’s ZEC program expires. This deal will expand Clinton’s clean energy output by 30 megawatts through plant uprates, expected to be fully complete in 2029, and will enable the Clinton Clean Energy Center to continue to flow power onto the local grid, providing grid reliability and low-cost power to the region for decades to come. The uprates are expected to qualify for the technology-neutral clean electricity PTC (45Y) provided for by the IRA and preserved by the OBBBA for its first 10 years of operations.\nProposed Acquisition of Calpine Corporation\nOn January 10, 2025, we entered an agreement and plan of merger (Merger Agreement) with Calpine Corporation (Calpine) under which we will acquire all the outstanding equity interests of Calpine in a cash and stock transaction. Calpine owns and operates a generation fleet of natural gas, geothermal, battery storage, and solar assets with over 27 GWs of generation capacity, in addition to a competitive retail electric supplier platform with 60 TWhs of load annually. \nThis acquisition is complementary to, and aligns strategically with, our existing business operations and provides both increased scale and meaningful market diversification. We will couple the largest producer of clean, carbon-free energy with the reliable, dispatchable natural gas assets of Calpine, and also create the nation’s leading competitive retail electric supplier, providing increased scale, diversification and complementary capabilities that will enable us to meet growing demand with a broader array of energy and sustainability products. The addition of Calpine will strengthen our essential role in providing clean, reliable, and affordable energy as the nation seeks to transition to a more sustainable future, and will better position us to pursue investments in new and existing technologies to meet growing demand. \nWe received regulatory approvals for the merger from the PUCT and NYPSC in June 2025 and from the FERC in July 2025. Completion of the transaction is subject to the expiration or termination of any agreement with the DOJ to delay the consummation of the transaction and other customary closing conditions. See Note 2 — Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Key Business Drivers \nTariffs\nThe energy sector has been impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign trade policies, particularly the introduction and adjustment of tariffs by the U.S. on the import of various energy-related products and materials. Importantly, oil, natural gas, and uranium (including enriched uranium) are currently excluded from most of the recent tariff changes. The imposition of tariffs on imported goods, including electric transformers and other equipment used for power generation, may lead to increased costs for acquiring essential components to maintain, uprate, and operate our generating facilities. We are committed to navigating the current environment through prudent cost management, utilization of supplier relationships, and potential supply alternatives as mitigants for potential price increases. The long-term impact of tariffs on the energy sector remains uncertain and we cannot predict or estimate the impact on future consolidated financial statements.\nRussia and Ukraine Conflict\nWe are closely monitoring developments of the ongoing Russia and Ukraine conflict, including United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Canadian sanctions, and legislation that may impact exports and imports of Russian nuclear fuel supply and enrichment activities, as well as the potential for Russia to limit fuel deliveries. The U.S. “Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act” became effective in August 2024, banning the import of low-enriched uranium into the U.S. that is produced in Russia or by Russian entities, absent a waiver from the DOE. Under a corollary bill, the Department of Energy has begun the process of distributing billions of dollars to \n49\nTable of Contents\nsupport expansion of the domestic nuclear fuel cycle within the United States to improve carbon-free energy security. In November 2024, the Russian government issued a decree imposing temporary restrictions on the export of enriched uranium from Russia to the U.S. but allowing for a special Russian export license to be issued for individual shipments. Our nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long-term uranium supply and service contracts. We work with a diverse set of domestic and international suppliers years in advance to procure our nuclear fuel to support our refueling needs and mitigate the risk of exposure to Russian nuclear fuel supply. Recognizing the potential for the continuing conflict to impact our longer-term security and cost of supply, we have entered into contracts to increase the size of our nuclear fuel inventory. Our fuel procurement activities comply with all U.S. and international trade laws and we continue to take advantage of all available avenues to maintain continuity in our nuclear fuel supply, including working with the U.S. Government and our diverse set of suppliers to secure the nuclear fuel needed to continue to operate our nuclear fleet long-term.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nRegulation of GHGs from Power Plants under the Clean Air Act.\n In April 2024, EPA issued a final rule that regulates greenhouse gases from existing coal, new natural gas-fired power plants, and existing oil/gas steam generators under Clean Air Act section 111. The applicable standards are subcategorized by retirement date for existing coal and capacity factor for new gas. In June 2025, EPA issued a proposal to repeal its regulations addressing GHG emissions from the sector. In July 2025, EPA issued a proposed rule to repeal the 2009 \"Endangerment Finding\" underpinning all GHG regulation by EPA. Repealing the finding would provide an independent basis for ending EPA regulation of GHGs from power plants. \nGood Neighbor Rule. \nIn June 2023, EPA published a final rule called “Federal 'Good Neighbor Plan' for the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards” also known as the \"Transport Rule\". The rule, among other things, establishes nitrogen oxides emissions budgets requiring fossil fuel-fired power plants in 23 states to participate in an allowance-based ozone season trading program beginning in 2023. In February 2023, EPA disapproved state implementation plans submitted by 21 states for failure to address their obligations under the \"good neighbor\" provisions of the Clean Air Act. However, several Regional Courts of Appeals issued orders staying, pending judicial review, EPA's disapproval of several state plans (including Texas). In June 2024, the Supreme Court stayed EPA's rule for the duration of the litigation. In November 2024, EPA issued an administrative stay of the rule. EPA has announced its intent to approve state plans that would replace the Good Neighbor Plan.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement makes a number of significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments in the preparation of our financial statements. At September 30, 2025, our critical accounting policies and estimates had not changed significantly from December 31, 2024. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates of our 2024 Form 10-K for further information.\nFinancial Results of Operations\nGAAP Results of Operations.  \nThe following table sets forth our consolidated GAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. For additional information regarding the financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, see the discussions of Results of Operations below.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n$ Change\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n$ Change\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nGAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders\n$\n930 \n$\n1,200 \n$\n(270)\n$\n1,887 \n$\n2,897 \n$\n(1,010)\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings.  \nWe utilize Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings (and/or its per share equivalent) in our internal analysis, and in communications with investors and analysts, as a consistent measure for comparing our financial performance and discussing the factors and trends affecting our business. The presentation of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is intended to complement and should not be considered an alternative to, nor more useful than, the presentation of GAAP Net Income.\n50\nTable of Contents\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a standardized financial measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations of similarly titled measures.\nUnless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling adjustment between GAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. For all adjustments except the NDT fund investment returns, which are included in decommissioning-related activities, the marginal statutory income tax rate was 25.6% and 25.5%\n \nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Under IRS regulations, NDT fund investment returns are taxed at different rates for investments if they are in qualified or non-qualified funds. The effective tax rates for the unrealized and realized gains and losses related to NDT funds were 54.9% and 54.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively and 54.8% and 55.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n \nThe following table provides a reconciliation between GAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n(In millions, except per share data)\nEarnings Per Share\n(a)\nEarnings Per Share\n(a)\nGAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders\n$\n930 \n$\n2.97 \n$\n1,200 \n$\n3.82 \nUnrealized (Gain) Loss on Fair Value Adjustments (net of taxes of $32 and $72, respectively)\n(b)\n94 \n0.30 \n(210)\n(0.67)\nPlant Retirements and Divestitures (net of taxes of $2 and $10, respectively)\n(5)\n(0.02)\n30 \n0.10 \nDecommissioning-Related Activities (net of taxes of $187 and $207, respectively)\n(c)\n(117)\n(0.37)\n(195)\n(0.62)\nPension & OPEB Non-Service (Credits) Costs (net of taxes of $3 and $1, respectively)\n9 \n0.03 \n(2)\n(0.01)\nAcquisition-Related Costs (net of taxes of $10 and $—, respectively)\n(d)\n28 \n0.09 \n— \n— \nChange in Environmental Liabilities (net of taxes of $— and $2, respectively)\n1 \n— \n5 \n0.02 \nERP System Implementation Costs (net of taxes of $— and $—, respectively)\n— \n— \n1 \n— \nIncome Tax-Related Adjustments\n(e)\n13 \n0.04 \n33 \n0.11 \nNoncontrolling Interests\n(f)\n(1)\n— \n(2)\n(0.01)\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings \n$\n952 \n$\n3.04 \n$\n860 \n$\n2.74 \n51\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n(In millions, except per share data)\nEarnings Per Share\n(a)\nEarnings Per Share\n(a)\nGAAP Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders\n$\n1,887 \n$\n6.02 \n$\n2,897 \n$\n9.17 \nUnrealized (Gain) Loss on Fair Value Adjustments (net of taxes of $163 and $264, respectively)\n(b)\n478 \n1.52 \n(786)\n(2.49)\nPlant Retirements and Divestitures (net of taxes of $4 and $23, respectively)\n13 \n0.04 \n68 \n0.22 \nDecommissioning-Related Activities (net of taxes of $426 and $343, respectively)\n(c)\n(242)\n(0.77)\n(227)\n(0.72)\nPension & OPEB Non-Service (Credits) Costs (net of taxes of $9 and $1, respectively)\n27 \n0.09 \n2 \n0.01 \nAcquisition-Related Costs (net of taxes of $17 and $—, respectively)\n(d)\n50 \n0.16 \n— \n— \nChange in Environmental Liabilities (net of taxes of $1 and $20, respectively)\n2 \n0.01 \n60 \n0.19 \nSeparation Costs (net of taxes of $— and  $3, respectively)\n— \n— \n9 \n0.03 \nERP System Implementation Costs (net of taxes of $— and $2, respectively)\n— \n— \n7 \n0.02 \nIncome Tax-Related Adjustments\n(e)\n13 \n0.04 \n(55)\n(0.17)\nNoncontrolling Interests\n(f)\n(4)\n(0.01)\n(5)\n(0.02)\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings \n$\n2,224 \n$\n7.09 \n$\n1,970 \n$\n6.23 \n__________\n(a)\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.

We report the sale and purchase of electricity in the spot market on a net hourly basis in either Operating revenues or Purchased power and fuel expense within each region, depending on our net hourly position. The price of electricity is impacted by several variables, including but not limited to, the price of fuels, generation resources in the region, weather, ongoing competition, emerging technologies, as well as macroeconomic and regulatory factors.

Capacity prices have a material impact on our operating revenues and purchased power and fuel expense. We report capacity on a net monthly basis within each region in either Operating revenues or Purchased power and fuel expense, depending on our net monthly position.

If the monthly CMC price per MWh calculation results in a net positive value, ComEd will multiply that value by the delivered quantity and pay the total to us. If the CMC price per MWh calculation results in a net negative value, we will multiply this value by the delivered quantity and pay the net value to ComEd. The average CMC prices per MWh were ($17.11) and $5.54 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and ($6.53) and $7.73 for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The average CMC prices may not necessarily reflect prices we ultimately realize as a result of interaction with the nuclear PTC discussed below.\nNuclear PTC.  \nBeginning in 2024, our nuclear units are eligible for a PTC extending through 2032. The nuclear PTC provides a transferable credit up to $15 per MWh and is subject to phase-out when annual gross receipts are between $25.00 per MWh and $43.75 per MWh and $26.00 per MWh and $44.75 per MWh for 2024 and 2025, respectively. Both the amount of the PTC and the gross receipts thresholds adjust for inflation annually through the duration of the program based on the GDP price deflator for the preceding calendar year.\n57\nTable of Contents\nMany of the state-sponsored programs (e.g., ZECs and CMCs) providing compensation for the emissions-free attributes of generation from certain of our nuclear units include contractual or other provisions that require us to refund that compensation up to the amount of the nuclear PTC received or pass through the entirety of the nuclear PTC received. See Note 6 — Government Assistance of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the nuclear PTC.\nThe following table summarizes the impacts to Operating revenues related to the benefits of nuclear PTC and state-sponsored programs subject to refund or pass through as described above for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 2024:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\n% Change\nNuclear PTC revenue\n(a)\n$\n175 \n$\n670 \n$\n(495)\n(73.9)\n%\n$\n220 \n$\n1,380 \n$\n(1,160)\n(84.1)\n%\nState-sponsored programs net revenue\n(b)\n(220)\n(115)\n(105)\n(91.3)\n%\n(30)\n10 \n(40)\n(400.0)\n%\n__________\n(a)\nOur estimate required the exercise of judgment in determining the amount of nuclear PTC expected for each of our nuclear units.

See Note 9 — Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n62\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAll results included throughout the liquidity and capital resources section are presented on a GAAP basis.\nOur operating and capital expenditures requirements are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. Our business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. We annually evaluate our financing plan and credit line sizing, focusing on maintaining our investment grade ratings while meeting our cash needs to fund capital requirements, including construction expenditures, retire debt, pay dividends, fund pension and OPEB obligations, and invest in new and existing ventures, such as our acquisition of Calpine. A broad spectrum of financing alternatives beyond the core financing options can be used to meet our needs and fund growth, including monetizing assets in the portfolio via project financing, asset sales, and the use of other financing structures (e.g., joint ventures, minority partners, etc.). Our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions. If these conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms, we have access to credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $9.5 billion. We utilize our credit facilities to support our commercial paper programs, provide for other short-term borrowings and to issue letters of credit. See the “Credit Matters and Cash Requirements” section below for additional information. We expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses, financing costs, and capital expenditure requirements. See Note 12 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCash Flow Activities\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2025\n2024\n$ Change\nCash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n$\n3,129 \n$\n454 \n$\n2,675 \nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n3,432 \n(1,448)\n4,880 \nInvesting activities\n(2,221)\n5,056 \n(7,277)\nFinancing activities\n(249)\n(2,180)\n1,931 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents\n962 \n1,428 \n(466)\nCash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents at end of period\n$\n4,091 \n$\n1,882 \n$\n2,209 \nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $3,432 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to cash used in operating activities of ($1,448) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Changes in our cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in results of operations, as adjusted for changes in working capital in the normal course of business. In December 2024, we amended our Accounts Receivable Facility whereby we now retain the rights to our receivables and any changes in our receivable balance flow through operating activities. This increase in cash flows from operating activities was partially offset by cash outflows associated with an increase in collateral postings. See Note 7 — Accounts Receivable and  Note 11 — Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  \n63\nTable of Contents\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities was ($2,221) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $5,056 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change was primarily due to an amendment of our Accounts Receivable Facility. Prior to the amendment, the collection and reinvestment of proceeds associated with the sale of receivables were treated as cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As a result of the amendment, cash collections of accounts receivable are now treated as Cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. See Note 7 — Accounts Receivable of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  \nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was ($249) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to cash used in financing activities of ($2,180) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change primarily relates to long-term debt and changes in short-term borrowings. Debt issuances and redemptions or repayments vary each year. The remaining change relates to repurchases of common stock during each period. See Note 12 — Debt and Credit Agreements and Note 15 — Shareholders' Equity of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nQuarterly dividends declared by our Board of Directors during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and for the fourth quarter of 2025 were as follows:\nPeriod\nDeclaration Date\nShareholder of Record Date\nDividend Payable Date\nCash per Share\nFirst Quarter of 2025\nFebruary 18, 2025\nMarch 7, 2025\nMarch 18, 2025\n$\n0.3878 \nSecond Quarter of 2025\nApril 29, 2025\nMay 16, 2025\nJune 6, 2025\n$\n0.3878 \nThird Quarter of 2025\nAugust 5, 2025\nAugust 18, 2025\nSeptember 5, 2025\n$\n0.3878 \nFourth Quarter of 2025\nOctober 29, 2025\nNovember 17, 2025\nDecember 5, 2025\n$\n0.3878 \nCredit Matters and Cash Requirements\nWe fund liquidity needs for capital expenditures, working capital, energy hedging and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations, public debt offerings, commercial paper markets and large, diversified credit facilities. As of September 30, 2025, we have access to facilities with aggregate bank commitments of $9.5 billion. During the quarter, we amended one of our existing revolving credit facilities to both extend the term of the existing facility and to provide up to $2.5 billion in incremental revolving credit commitments upon the satisfaction of certain conditions following the consummation of our acquisition of Calpine. See Note 12 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nWe had access to the commercial paper markets and had availability under our revolving credit facilities during the third quarter of 2025 to fund our short-term liquidity needs, when necessary. We routinely review the sufficiency of our liquidity position, including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments, by performing various stress test scenarios, such as commodity price movements, increases in margin-related transactions, changes in hedging levels, and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades. We closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities, including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks, credit default swap levels, capital raising, and merger activity. See PART I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS of our 2024 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets.\nWe believe our cash flow from operating activities, access to credit markets and our credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity to support the estimated future cash requirements discussed below, including the cash consideration necessary to close on our proposed acquisition of Calpine. See Note 2 — Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n64\nTable of Contents\nSecurity Ratings\nOur access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and our financing costs in those markets, may depend on our securities ratings. A loss of investment grade credit rating would have required a three-notch downgrade by S&P or Moody's from their current levels as of September 30, 2025 of BBB+ and Baa1, to BB+ and Ba1 or below, respectively. As of September 30, 2025, we had $7.3 billion of available capacity under our credit facilities and $4.0 billion of cash on hand. In the event of a credit downgrade below investment grade and a resulting requirement to provide incremental collateral exceeding available capacity under our credit facilities and cash on hand, we would be required to access additional liquidity through the capital markets. Our borrowings are not subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrade of our securities, although such a downgrade could increase fees and interest charges under our credit agreements. Our credit ratings were affirmed following the announcement of our proposed acquisition of Calpine.\nIf we had lost our investment grade credit ratings as of September 30, 2025, we would have been required to provide incremental collateral estimated to be approximately $2.4 billion to meet collateral obligations for derivatives, non-derivatives, NPNS, and applicable payables and receivables, net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements. \nSee Note 11 — Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 12 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe consider various factors when making qualified pension funding decisions, including actuarially-determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act, and management of the pension obligation. The Pension Protection Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively) and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). The contributions below reflect a funding strategy to make annual contributions to offset the growth of the liability. Based on this funding strategy and current market conditions, which are both subject to change, our annual qualified pension contribution was made in February 2025 for $161 million. Unlike the qualified pension plans, our non-qualified plans are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements. \nOPEB plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, though we have funded a portion of our plans. Annually, we evaluate whether additional funding for those plans is needed. For our funded OPEB plans, we consider several factors in determining the level of our contributions, including liabilities management and levels of benefit claims paid. The estimated benefit payments to the non-qualified pension plans in 2025 are approximately $19 million and the planned contributions to the OPEB plans, including estimated benefit payments to unfunded plans, are $22 million. Expected contributions in 2025 or future years could be affected by adjustments in our pension and OPEB funding strategy, market conditions, or pension regulation changes. Refer to ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Liquidity and Capital Resources of our 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on pension and other postretirement benefits.\nCash Requirements for Other Financial Commitments\nRefer to ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Liquidity and Capital Resources of our 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on our cash requirements for financial commitments. \nCustomer Accounts Receivable Financing \nWe have an accounts receivable financing facility with a number of financial institutions which provides us access to revolving loans secured by certain receivables. See Note 12 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n65\nTable of Contents\nProject Financing\nProject financing is based upon a nonrecourse financial structure, in which project debt is paid back from the cash generated by a specific asset or portfolio of assets. Borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project. Lenders do not have recourse against us in the event of a default. If a project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific debt covenants, there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other project-related borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. In these instances, if such repayment were not satisfied, or restructured, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project-specific assets and related collateral. The potential requirement to repay the debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful lives. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of our 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on project finance credit facilities and nonrecourse debt.\nCredit Facilities\nWe meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. We may use our credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit. See Note 12 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our credit facilities.\nNRC Minimum Funding Requirements\nNRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient funds will be available in certain minimum amounts for radiological decommissioning of the facility. These NRC minimum funding levels are typically based upon the assumption that decommissioning activities will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit. If a unit fails the NRC minimum funding test, then the plant’s owners or parent companies would be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through surety bonds, letters of credit, or parent company guarantees or making additional cash contributions to the NDT fund to ensure sufficient funds are available. See Note 8 — Nuclear Decommissioning of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the latest funding status report filed with the NRC.\nAs of September 30, 2025, the Crane NDT is fully funded under the SAFSTOR scenario that was the planned decommissioning option, as described in the Crane PSDAR filed with the NRC in April 2019. We will continue to file Crane's decommissioning funding status with the NRC annually until restart, at which point we will file decommissioning funding status reports in accordance with applicable NRC requirements. Additionally, as of September 30, 2025, we have adequate NDT funds for the remaining radiological decommissioning costs at Zion Station related to the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation. Decommissioning costs other than radiological may require funding from us. See Liquidity and Capital Resources — NRC Minimum Funding Requirements of our 2024 Form 10-K for information regarding the risk of additional financial assurance for shutdown units."
