The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Berry (the “Merger”), with Berry surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amcor. On April 30, 2025, we completed the transactions called for by the Merger Agreement to obtain all of the ownership interest in Berry for purchase consideration of $10.4 billion, not including Berry debt assumed by Amcor of approximately $5.2 billion. In connection with the closing of the Merger, we issued approximately 846 million ordinary shares to Berry shareholders, excluding shares for Berry vested share-based payment and cash settled awards at closing, and paid $2.2 billion in connection with the required extinguishment of certain Berry indebtedness using the proceeds from the cumulative issuance of $2.2 billion in long-term debt in March 2025. Refer to Part 1, Item 1 - Financial Statements, Note 3, \"Acquisitions\", for further information. \nBerry Plan\n    In connection with the Merger with Berry, the Company initiated restructuring and integration activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 (\"Berry Plan\") aimed at integrating the combined organization. The Company continues to target realizing approximately $530 million of pre-tax synergies driven by procurement, supply chain, and general and administrative savings, $60 million in annual financial synergies and $60 million in pre-tax earnings benefits from growth synergies by the end of fiscal year 2028. The total Berry Plan pre-tax cash cost is estimated at $280 million, net, including restructuring activities and general integration expenses. As of September 30, 2025, the Company has initiated restructuring projects with an expected net cost of approximately $165 million, of which $94 million relates to employee related expenses, $13 million to fixed asset related expenses (net of expected gains on asset disposals), $33 million to other restructuring expenses, and $25 million to restructuring related expenses. In addition, the Company expects to spend approximately $90 million on general integration costs. The restructuring and general integration activities initiated to date are expected to result in $190 million of net cash expenditures. The Berry Plan is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2028.\n    In the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company incurred $48 million in employee related expenses, $3 million in other restructuring, and $2 million in restructuring related expenses, partially offset by a net gain of $13 million on fixed asset related items, with $9 million incurred in the Global Flexible Packaging Solutions reportable segment, $28 million incurred in the Global Rigid Packaging Solutions reportable segment, and $3 million incurred in Corporate. The Company also incurred $8 million in integration activities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. Net cash outflows for restructuring and related expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025, were approximately $1 million. Net cash expenditures of approximately $100 million to $120 million are expected for the balance of fiscal year 2026 for restructuring and general integration activities, with $80 million to $90 million representing payments for restructuring and related expenses.\nReview of Portfolio-Related Strategic Alternatives\n    In August 2025, we announced that we are reviewing strategic alternatives to maximize the value of our portfolio and have identified businesses with combined sales of $2.5 billion, which includes our North American Beverage business, for further review given they are less aligned with one or more core portfolio attributes including attractive growth and margin profile, industry structure, and scale and leadership position. Possible actions for these businesses include and are not limited to restructuring, partnership and joint venture ownership models, cash sale or a combination thereof. While we continue to progress in our strategic alternatives review and expect to make progress in fiscal year 2026 on actions related to this strategic review, we have not identified a set deadline or definitive timetable for completion of the strategic alternatives review process and related actions and there is no assurance that this review will result in any transaction or that any such outcome will be successful.\n39\nEconomic and Market Conditions\n    Market dynamics remain challenging with softer consumer demand and customer order volatility in certain markets, and higher costs in certain areas, including labor costs, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. The underlying causes for the market volatility being experienced can be attributed to a variety of factors, such as geopolitical tension and conflicts, volatility and changes in U.S. domestic and global tariff frameworks and inflation in many economies impacting consumption and consumer demand. Rapid changes in U.S. trade policies, including the announcement of wide-spread tariff increases which were paused and then re-announced, amid persistent inflation in the U.S., has impacted global market conditions resulting in fluctuating consumer demand across many categories.\n    While we generally source and manufacture our products in the local markets where they are sold, the volatility in tariffs may continue to negatively impact customer and consumer demand, disrupt our supply chains, and increase inflation, raising our costs. In this context, we have remained focused on taking price and cost actions to offset inflation and aligning our cost base with market dynamics and expect to continue to do so. There is no assurance that we will meet our performance expectations or that ongoing geopolitical tensions, including disruptions related to tariffs and other factors, will not negatively impact our financial results.\nHighly Inflationary Accounting\n    We have subsidiaries in Argentina that historically had a functional currency of the Argentine Peso. As of June 30, 2018, the Argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2018, we began reporting the financial results of our Argentine subsidiaries with a functional currency of the Argentine Peso at the functional currency of the parent, which is the U.S. dollar. The impact of highly inflationary accounting in the three months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024 resulted in a negative impact on monetary assets of $11 million and $2 million, respectively, and $11 million and $2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively, in foreign currency transaction losses that were reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. In October 2025, the Argentine central bank indicated it had signed a $20 billion exchange-rate stabilization agreement with the United States Treasury Department. We continue to monitor the foreign currency exposure risk of our operations in Argentina, which represented less than 1% of total assets as of September 30, 2025.\n40\nResults of Operations - Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 \nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, \n($ in millions, except per share data)\n2025\n2024\nNet sales\n$\n5,745 \n$\n3,353 \nOperating income\n461 \n312 \nOperating income as a percentage of net sales\n8.0 \n%\n9.3 \n%\nNet income attributable to Amcor plc\n$\n262 \n$\n191 \nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n$\n0.113 \n$\n0.132 \n    Net sales increased by $2,392 million, or 71%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding the increase of sales from the merger with Berry Global Group, Inc. (the \"Merger\"), net of divestments, of approximately $2,363 million, the positive currency impacts of approximately $110 million,  and the negative impacts from the pass-through of lower raw material costs of approximately $23 million, the remaining variation in net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was a decrease of approximately $58 million or 2%, reflecting lower sales volumes of approximately 3% and favorable price/mix impact of approximately 1%.\n    Net income attributable to Amcor plc increased by $71 million, or 37%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. This is mainly due to increased gross profit of $465 million and higher other income, net, of $24 million, partially offset by higher selling, general, and administrative expenses of $159 million, increased amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $94 million, increased restructuring, transaction and integration expenses of $69 million, increased research and development expenses of $18 million, and higher interest expense, net, of $78 million, all primarily due to the Merger.\n    Diluted earnings per share (\"Diluted EPS\") decreased by $0.019, or 14%, for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024, with the net income available to ordinary shareholders of Amcor plc increasing by 38% due to the above items and the diluted weighted average number of shares remaining increasing by 60% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding was largely due to the completion of the Merger with Berry and the related share issuances.\nSegment Results of Operations\nGlobal Flexible Packaging Solutions Segment\nThree Months Ended September 30, \n($ in millions)\n2025\n2024\nNet sales\n$\n3,257 \n$\n2,552 \nAdjusted EBIT\n426 \n329 \nAdjusted EBIT as a percentage of net sales\n13.1 \n%\n12.9 \n%\n    Net sales increased by $705 million, or 28% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.

These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable. These measures exclude the impact of certain amounts related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equipment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation, and the write-down of equipment. These measures also exclude gains or losses on sales of significant property and divestitures, significant property and other impairments, net of insurance recovery, certain regulatory and litigation matters, significant pension settlements, impairments in goodwill and equity method investments, and certain acquisition-related expenses, including financing-related, transaction, and integration expenses, due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, order backlog, intangible amortization, changes in the fair value of contingent acquisition payments and economic hedging instruments on commercial paper, CEO transition costs, and impacts related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Note that while amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, the revenue of the acquired entities and all other expenses unless otherwise stated, are reflected in Adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income and the acquired assets contribute to revenue generation.\n    This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use the non-GAAP measures to evaluate operating performance and believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors and other external parties to perform comparisons of our current and historical performance.\n    A reconciliation of reported net income attributable to Amcor plc to Adjusted EBIT, and adjusted net income for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024 is as follows: \nThree Months Ended September 30, \n($ in millions)\n2025\n2024\nNet income attributable to Amcor plc, as reported\n$\n262 \n$\n191 \nAdd: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n— \n2 \nNet income \n262 \n193 \nAdd: Income tax expense\n49 \n43 \nAdd: Interest expense\n168 \n86 \nLess: Interest income\n(15)\n(11)\nEBIT\n464 \n311 \nAdd: Amortization of acquired intangible assets from business combinations (1)\n133 \n39 \nAdd: Impact of hyperinflation (2)\n11 \n2 \nAdd: Transaction costs (3)\n22 \n— \nAdd: Restructuring, integration and related expenses, net (4)\n53 \n6 \nAdd: Other (5)\n4 \n7 \nAdjusted EBIT\n$\n687\n \n$\n365\n \nLess: Interest expense\n(168)\n(86)\nAdd: Adjustments to interest expense (6)\n13 \n— \nLess: Income tax expense\n(49)\n(43)\nLess: Adjustments to income tax expense (7)\n(50)\n(11)\nAdd: Interest income\n15 \n11 \nLess: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n— \n(2)\nAdjusted net income \n$\n448\n \n$\n234\n \n(1)\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets from business combinations includes amortization expense related to all acquired intangible assets from past acquisitions.\n(2)\nImpact of hyperinflation includes the adverse impact of highly inflationary accounting for subsidiaries in Argentina where the functional currency was the Argentine Peso.\n(3)\nTransaction costs includes incremental costs related to the Merger.

The issuers and guarantors conduct large parts of their operations through other subsidiaries of Amcor plc.\n47\n    Insolvency proceedings with respect to the issuers and guarantors could proceed under, and be governed by, among others, Jersey, United States, or English insolvency law, as the case may be, if either issuer or any guarantor defaults on its obligations under the applicable notes or guarantees, respectively.\n    Set forth below is the summarized financial information of the Obligor Groups 1, 2 and 3:\nBasis of Preparation\n    The following summarized financial information is presented for the parent, issuer, and guarantor subsidiaries (\"Obligor Group\") on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions between entities in each Obligor Group and amounts related to investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor. This information is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the combined group of companies in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company reclassified prior year comparative in the Balance Sheets for Obligor Group to conform with current year presentation which transferred certain subsidiary liabilities due to subsidiaries outside the obligor group from current to non-current. \nStatement of Income for Obligor Group\n($ in millions)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025\nObligor Group 1\nObligor Group 2\nObligor Group 3\nNet sales - external\n$\n441 \n$\n202 \n$\n441 \nNet sales - to subsidiaries outside the Obligor Group\n2 \n— \n2 \nTotal net sales\n$\n443 \n$\n202 \n$\n443 \nGross profit\n100 \n42 \n100 \nNet income (1)\n$\n183\n \n$\n152\n \n$\n183\n \nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\n— \n— \n— \nNet income attributable to Obligor Group\n$\n183\n \n$\n152\n \n$\n183\n \n(1) Includes income from Amcor entities from outside each Obligor Group, mainly attributable to intercompany interest income.\nBalance Sheets for Obligor Group\n($ in millions)\nAs of September 30, 2025\nObligor Group 1\nObligor Group 2\nObligor Group 3\nAssets\nCurrent assets - external\n$\n2,780 \n$\n226 \n$\n2,780 \nCurrent assets - due from subsidiaries outside the Obligor Group\n141 \n— \n141 \nTotal current assets\n2,921 \n226 \n2,921 \nNon-current assets - external\n3,183 \n1,773 \n3,183 \nNon-current assets - due from subsidiaries outside the Obligor Group\n11,981 \n1,087 \n11,981 \nTotal non-current assets\n15,164 \n2,860 \n— \n15,164 \nTotal assets\n$\n18,085\n \n$\n3,086\n \n$\n18,085\n \nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities - external\n$\n4,642 \n$\n3,031 \n$\n4,642 \nCurrent liabilities - due to subsidiaries outside the Obligor Group\n18 \n— \n18 \nTotal current liabilities\n4,660 \n3,031 \n4,660 \nNon-current liabilities - external\n15,490 \n5,809 \n15,490 \nNon-current liabilities - due to subsidiaries outside the Obligor Group (1)\n8,016 \n1,560 \n6,976 \nTotal non-current liabilities\n23,506 \n7,369 \n22,466 \nTotal liabilities\n$\n28,166\n \n$\n10,400\n \n$\n27,126\n \n48\nAs of June 30, 2025\nObligor Group 1\nObligor Group 2\nObligor Group 3\nAssets\nCurrent assets - external\n$\n2,620 \n$\n274 \n$\n2,620 \nCurrent assets - due from subsidiaries outside the Obligor Group\n212 \n— \n212 \nTotal current assets\n2,832 \n274 \n2,832 \nNon-current assets - external\n3,187 \n1,784 \n3,187 \nNon-current assets - due from subsidiaries outside the Obligor Group\n11,806 \n1,134 \n11,806 \nTotal non-current assets\n14,993 \n2,918 \n14,993 \nTotal assets\n$\n17,825\n \n$\n3,192\n \n$\n17,825\n \nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities - external\n$\n4,534 \n$\n2,478 \n$\n4,534 \nCurrent liabilities - due to subsidiaries outside the Obligor Group\n35 \n— \n35 \nTotal current liabilities\n4,569 \n2,478 \n4,569 \nNon-current liabilities - external\n15,154 \n6,199 \n15,154 \nNon-current liabilities - due to subsidiaries outside the Obligor Group (1)\n8,094 \n1,703 \n7,060 \nTotal non-current liabilities\n23,248 \n7,902 \n22,214 \nTotal liabilities\n$\n27,817\n \n$\n10,380\n \n$\n26,783\n \n(1) Includes unsettled cash pooling arrangement received by the obligor group on behalf of subsidiaries outside of the obligor group. \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n    Refer to Note 2, \"New Accounting Guidance,\" in \"Item 1. Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\".\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\n    Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to retirement benefits, intangible assets, goodwill, and expected future performance of operations. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. There have been no material changes in critical accounting estimates and judgments as of September 30, 2025, from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\n49\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n    We finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings from banks, and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity. We periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions, expected future cash flows, potential funding requirements for debt refinancing, capital expenditures and acquisitions, the cost of capital, sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios, the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings, and our ease of access to funding sources. \n    We believe that our cash flows provided by operating activities, together with borrowings available under our credit facilities and access to the commercial paper market, backstopped by our bank debt facilities, will continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and other commitments, including dividends and purchases of our ordinary shares and CHESS Depositary Instruments under authorized share repurchase programs, if any, into the foreseeable future.\nOverview\nThree Months Ended September 30, \n($ in millions)\n2025\n2024\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$\n(133)\n$\n(269)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(226)\n(155)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n358 \n237 \nCash Flow Overview\n    Net Cash Used in Operating Activities\n    Net cash used in operating activities decreased by $136 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change is primarily driven by higher net income, adjusted for non-cash items, in the current period, partially offset by higher working capital outflows in the current period.\n    Net Cash Used in Investing Activities\n    Net cash used in investing activities increased by $71 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change is primarily driven by higher net purchases of property, plant, and equipment in the current period, primarily driven by the Merger.\n    Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n    Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $121 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change is primarily driven by higher net borrowings of commercial paper in the current period, partially offset by higher dividends paid, and higher dividend per share paid for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. These changes were primarily driven by the Merger.\nNet Debt\n    We borrow from financial institutions and debt investors in the form of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, and commercial paper. We have a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates and use interest rate swaps to provide further flexibility in managing the interest cost of borrowings.\n \n    Short-term debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 months and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the short-term nature of the borrowings, except where we have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt beyond 12 months. The current portion of long-term debt consists of debt amounts repayable within a year after the balance sheet date.\n    Our primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured indebtedness incurred outside the guarantor group as well as the\n \nsecured indebtedness we can incur to an aggregate of 15.0% of our total tangible assets, subject to some exceptions and variations by facility. In addition, the covenants \n50\nof the bank debt facilities require us to maintain a leverage ratio not higher than 3.9 times, stepping up to 4.25 times for the twelve consecutive calendar months following the consummation of an acquisition with aggregate consideration in excess of $375 million. The negative pledge arrangements and the financial covenants are defined in the related debt agreements. As of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank debt facilities.\n    Our net debt as of September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2025, was $14.0 billion and $13.3 billion, respectively.\nDebt Facilities\n    As of September 30, 2025, the revolving senior bank debt facility had an aggregate limit of $3.75 billion, of which $2.44 billion had been drawn (inclusive of amounts drawn under commercial paper programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilities). Our senior facility is available to fund working capital, growth capital expenditures, and refinancing obligations. Subject to certain conditions, we can request the total commitment level under the agreement to be increased by up to $1.0 billion.\nDividend Payments\n    We declared and paid a $0.1275 cash dividend per ordinary share during the three months ended September 30, 2025.\nCredit Rating\n    \nOur capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from three internationally recognized credit rating agencies. These investment grade credit ratings are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest, for various terms, and from a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid, including European and U.S. debt capital markets, and from global financial institutions.\nShare Repurchases\n    In the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company did not maintain a share repurchase program as the prior program had expired on its terms.\n    We had cash outflows of $22 million and $43 million for the purchase of our shares in the open market during the three months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024, respectively, as treasury shares to satisfy the vesting and exercises of share-based compensation awards. As of September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2025, we held treasury shares at a cost of $35 million and $6 million, respectively, representing approximately 3.6 million and 0.5 million shares, respectively.\n51"
