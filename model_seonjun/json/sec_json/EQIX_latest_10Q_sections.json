Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"intends\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below and \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date of this Report and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management's perspective and is presented as follows: \n•\nOverview\n•\nResults of Operations\n•\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n•\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOverview\nWe provide a global, vendor-neutral data center, interconnection and edge solutions platform with offerings that aim to enable our customers to reach everywhere, interconnect everyone and integrate everything. Global enterprises, service providers and business ecosystems of industry partners rely on our IBX data centers and expertise around the world for the safe housing of their critical IT equipment and to protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. They also look to Platform Equinix\n®\n for the ability to directly and securely interconnect to the networks, clouds and content that enable today's information-driven global digital economy. Our recent IBX data center openings and acquisitions, as well as xScale\nTM\n data center investments, have expanded our total global footprint to 273 IBXs, including 21 xScale data centers and the MC1 and SN1 data centers that are held in unconsolidated joint ventures, across 77 markets around the world. We offer the following solutions:\n•\npremium data center colocation;\n•\ninterconnection and data exchange solutions;\n•\nedge solutions for deploying networking, security and hardware; and\n39\nTable of Contents\n•\nremote expert support and professional services.\nOur data centers around the world allow our customers to bring together and interconnect the infrastructure they need to fast-track their digital advantage. With Equinix, they can scale with agility, accelerate the launch of digital offerings, deliver world-class experiences and multiply their value. We enable them to differentiate by distributing infrastructure and removing the distance between clouds, users, and applications in order to reduce latency and deliver a superior customer, partner and employee experience. The Equinix global platform, and the quality of our offerings, have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose Platform Equinix for bandwidth cost and performance reasons, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers and connect directly with each other. This adjacency creates a network effect that attracts new customers, continuously enhances our existing customers' value and enables them to capture further economic and performance benefits from our offerings. \nIndustry Overview:\nWhile a large number of enterprises and service providers, such as hyperscale cloud service providers, own their own data centers, we believe the industry is shifting away from single-tenant solutions to customers outsourcing some or all of their IT housing and interconnection requirements to third-party facilities, such as those operated by Equinix. This shift is being accelerated by the increasing adoption of hybrid multi-cloud architectures and the adoption of artificial intelligence (“AI”). \nHistorically, the outsourcing market was served by large telecommunications carriers that bundled their products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and carrier-neutral multi-tenant data centers (\"MTDC\"), public and private cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, large hyperscale cloud providers and systems integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 2,400 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. The global MTDC market is highly fragmented. Each of these data center solution providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, outsourced IT infrastructure solutions and managed services. We believe that this outsourcing trend has accelerated and is likely to continue to accelerate in the coming years, especially in light of the movement to digital business, the use of multiple cloud service providers, and the adoption of AI. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 36 countries with the industry’s largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and a highly scalable set of offerings.\nCapacity Trends:\nOur cabinet utilization rate represents the percentage of cabinet space billed versus total cabinet capacity, which is used to measure how efficiently we are managing our cabinet capacity. Our cabinet utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Our cabinet utilization rates were approximately 78% as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption, which we expect to accelerate with the adoption of AI, has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our existing IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center, and in our ability to expand our footprint in existing and new markets. Additionally, global supply chain challenges could result in a lack of availability or delays in the delivery of data center equipment. These challenges have driven us to invest in and commit to future purchases in advance of our standard practice to mitigate risks associated with these supply chain issues. These constraints could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, results of operations and cash flows and the growth opportunities presented by the adoption of new technologies, including AI.\nExpansion Opportunities:\nTo serve the needs of the growing hyperscale data center market, including the world's largest cloud service providers and increased demand driven in part by the adoption of AI, we have entered into joint venture partnership arrangements across our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions to develop and operate xScale data centers.\n40\nTable of Contents\nStrategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing customers, power availability and capacity, quality of the design, access to networks, clouds and software partners, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, automation capabilities, developer talent pool, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to our standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.\nRevenue:\nOur business is primarily based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to five years in length, and thereafter automatically renews in one-year increments. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during the past three years, more than 90% of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 36% of our recurring revenues for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nOur non-recurring revenues are primarily derived from fees charged from installations related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services we perform for our customers, including our joint ventures. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installations are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the contract term. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally treated as a contract modification and recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. \nOperating Expenses:\nCost of Revenues.\n The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, IBX data center employees' salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment, and security. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. In addition, the cost of electricity is subject to seasonal fluctuations. \n41\nTable of Contents\nOur costs of electricity may also increase as a result of the physical effects of climate change, global energy supply constraints, increased regulations driving alternative electricity generation due to environmental considerations or as a result of our election to use renewable energy sources. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \nSales and Marketing.\n Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, amortization of contract costs, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.\nGeneral and Administrative.\n Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and depreciation expense on back office systems.\nTaxation as a REIT:\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of September 30, 2025, our REIT structure included a majority of our data center operations in the Americas and EMEA regions, as well as the data center operations in Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\"). We have also included our share of the assets in xScale joint ventures (with the exception of Korea) in our REIT structure.\nAs a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our U.S. federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. The taxable income represented by such dividends is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the entity level but is taxed in the U.S., if at all, at the stockholder level. Depending on a shareholder’s citizenry and residency, the income could be taxed by other jurisdictions as well. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations is subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes, as applicable. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to local income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through qualified REIT subsidiaries (\"QRSs\") for U.S. income tax purposes. We are also subject to a separate U.S. federal corporate income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as an asset held by us or a QRS following the liquidation or other conversion of a former TRS). This built-in-gain tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. In addition, should we recognize any gain from \"prohibited transactions,\" we will be subject to tax on this gain at a 100% rate. \"Prohibited transactions,\" for this purpose, are defined as dispositions of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and other than dispositions excepted by statutory safe harbors. If we fail to remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates. Even if we remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs' operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules, and some may not follow them at all.\nWe continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the REIT structure in future periods.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted, making permanent or extending key provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including 100% bonus depreciation, domestic R&D expensing, business interest expense limitations and the qualified business income deduction for ordinary REIT dividends. The OBBBA also revises international tax rules such as the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion and raises the REIT asset threshold for taxable REIT subsidiaries from 20% to 25%, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025. The legislation does not have a material impact on our income tax position.\nOn September 17, 2025, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $4.69 per share. On October 29, 2025, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $4.69 per share, payable on December 17, 2025, to our common stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 19, 2025. We expect all of our 2025 quarterly distributions and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed our REIT taxable income to be recognized in 2025.\n42\nTable of Contents\n2025 Highlights:\n•\nIn February and March, we sold 107,493 shares on a spot basis under the 2024 ATM Program for approximately $99 million, net of commissions and other offering expenses. See Note 11 within the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n•\nIn March, we issued SGD500 million, or approximately $370 million, at the exchange rate in effect on issuance, of senior notes due in 2030. See Note 9 within the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n•\nIn May, we issued €1.5 billion, or approximately $1.7 billion, at the exchange rate in effect on issuance, of senior notes due in 2029 and 2034. See Note 9 within the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n•\nIn June, we completed our acquisition of all outstanding shares of TIM NextGen DC Corporation, consisting of three data centers in the Philippines, for total purchase consideration of $183 million. See Note 4 within the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n•\nIn August, we issued SGD650 million, or approximately $500 million, at the exchange rate in effect on issuance, of senior notes due in 2032. See Note 9 within the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nIn order to provide a framework for assessing our performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we supplement the year-over-year actual change in results of operations with comparative changes on a constant currency basis. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion. \nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nRevenues.\n Our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions ($ in millions):\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n$ Change\n% Change\n \n2025\n%\n2024\n%\nActual\nActual\nConstant\nCurrency\n (1)\nAmericas:\nRecurring revenues\n$\n987 \n43 \n%\n$\n914 \n42 \n%\n$\n73 \n8 \n%\n8 \n%\nNon-recurring revenues\n48 \n2 \n%\n44 \n2 \n%\n4 \n9 \n%\n9 \n%\n1,035 \n45 \n%\n958 \n44 \n%\n77 \n8 \n%\n8 \n%\nEMEA:\nRecurring revenues\n756 \n33 \n%\n713 \n32 \n%\n43 \n6 \n%\n4 \n%\nNon-recurring revenues\n28 \n1 \n%\n30 \n1 \n%\n(2)\n(7)\n%\n(10)\n%\n784 \n34 \n%\n743 \n33 \n%\n41 \n6 \n%\n3 \n%\nAsia-Pacific:\nRecurring revenues\n472 \n20 \n%\n432 \n20 \n%\n40 \n9 \n%\n8 \n%\nNon-recurring revenues\n25 \n1 \n%\n68 \n3 \n%\n(43)\n(63)\n%\n(65)\n%\n497 \n21 \n%\n500 \n23 \n%\n(3)\n(1)\n%\n(2)\n%\nTotal:\nRecurring revenues\n2,215 \n96 \n%\n2,059 \n94 \n%\n156 \n8 \n%\n6 \n%\nNon-recurring revenues\n101 \n4 \n%\n142 \n6 \n%\n(41)\n(29)\n%\n(30)\n%\n$\n2,316 \n100 \n%\n$\n2,201 \n100 \n%\n$\n115 \n5 \n%\n4 \n%\n(1)\nAs defined in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n43\nTable of Contents\nRevenues\n(in millions)\nAmericas Revenues. \nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, Americas revenues increased by $77 million or 8% (8% on a constant currency basis). Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to:\n•\napproximately $29 million of incremental revenues generated from IBX data center expansion projects which were completed within the twelve months ended September 30, 2025; and\n•\nan increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.\nEMEA Revenues.\n \nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, EMEA revenues increased by $41 million or 6% (3% on a constant currency basis). Growth in EMEA revenues was primarily due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.\nAsia-Pacific Revenues. \nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, Asia-Pacific revenues decreased by $3 million or 1% (2% on a constant currency basis). Decrease in Asia-Pacific revenues was primarily due to a decrease of $48 million in revenues from non-recurring services provided to our joint ventures. This was substantially offset by an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.\nCost of Revenues.\n Our cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 by geographic regions was as follows ($ in millions):\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n$ Change\n% Change\n \n2025\n%\n2024\n%\nActual\nActual\nConstant\nCurrency\nAmericas\n$\n467 \n41 \n%\n$\n446 \n41 \n%\n$\n21 \n5 \n%\n5 \n%\nEMEA\n425 \n37 \n%\n387 \n35 \n%\n38 \n10 \n%\n6 \n%\nAsia-Pacific\n250 \n22 \n%\n265 \n24 \n%\n(15)\n(6)\n%\n(7)\n%\nTotal\n$\n1,142 \n100 \n%\n$\n1,098 \n100 \n%\n$\n44 \n4 \n%\n2 \n%\n44\nTable of Contents\nCost of Revenues\n($ in millions; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)\nAmericas Cost of Revenues. \nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, Americas cost of revenues increased by $21 million or 5% (5% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to $12 million of higher depreciation expense driven by IBX data center expansions and higher costs across various other categories including compensation costs and software costs.\nEMEA Cost of Revenues. \nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, EMEA cost of revenues increased by $38 million or 10% (6% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to higher costs across various categories including rent and facilities costs and repairs and maintenance expense. \nAsia-Pacific Cost of Revenues.\n During the three months ended September 30, 2025, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues decreased by $15 million or 6% (7% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to $21 million of lower costs to provide non-recurring services, partially offset by higher compensation costs and higher depreciation expense.\nWe expect cost of revenues to increase across all three regions in line with the growth of our business. \nSales and Marketing Expenses\n. Our sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 by geographic regions were as follows ($ in millions):\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n$ Change\n% Change\n \n2025\n%\n2024\n%\nActual\nActual\nConstant\nCurrency\nAmericas\n$\n140 \n64 \n%\n$\n147 \n62 \n%\n$\n(7)\n(5)\n%\n(5)\n%\nEMEA\n51 \n23 \n%\n53 \n22 \n%\n(2)\n(4)\n%\n(8)\n%\nAsia-Pacific\n28 \n13 \n%\n37 \n16 \n%\n(9)\n(24)\n%\n(25)\n%\nTotal\n$\n219 \n100 \n%\n$\n237 \n100 \n%\n$\n(18)\n(8)\n%\n(8)\n%\n45\nTable of Contents\nSales and Marketing Expenses\n($ in millions; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)\nAmericas Sales and Marketing Expenses\n. \nOur Americas sales and marketing expense did not materially change during the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nEMEA Sales and Marketing Expens\nes.\n \nOur EMEA sales and marketing expense did not materially change during the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nAsia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. \nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expense decreased by $9 million or 24% (25% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to lower bad debt expense.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to invest in sales and marketing initiatives to support the growth of our business. We expect our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than those of our other regions since certain global sales and marketing functions are located within the U.S.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n.\n Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 by geographic regions were as follows ($ in millions):\n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n$ Change\n% Change\n \n2025\n%\n2024\n%\nActual\nActual\nConstant\nCurrency\nAmericas\n$\n325 \n69 \n%\n$\n293 \n67 \n%\n$\n32 \n11 \n%\n11 \n%\nEMEA\n88 \n19 \n%\n82 \n19 \n%\n6 \n7 \n%\n5 \n%\nAsia-Pacific\n57 \n12 \n%\n59 \n14 \n%\n(2)\n(3)\n%\n(2)\n%\nTotal\n$\n470 \n100 \n%\n$\n434 \n100 \n%\n$\n36 \n8 \n%\n8 \n%\n46\nTable of Contents\n \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n($ in millions; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)\nAmericas General and Administrative Expense\ns\n.\n \nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, Americas general and administrative expenses increased by $32 million or 11% (11% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:\n•\n$17 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation; and\n•\n$15 million of higher depreciation expense associated with back-office systems to support the growth of our business and acceleration of depreciation expense for certain assets with shortened useful lives.\nEMEA General and Administrative Expenses. \nOur EMEA general and administrative expenses did not materially change during the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nAsia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. \nOur Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses did not materially change during the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nGoing forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we will continue to invest in our operations to support our growth, including investments to enhance our technology platform, to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and to integrate recent acquisitions. Additionally, since our corporate headquarters is located in the U.S., we expect the Americas general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to continue to be higher than those of other regions.\nRestructuring Charges. \nWe did not record a significant amount of restructuring charges during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nTransaction Costs.\n We did not record a significant amount of transaction costs during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. \nImpairment Charges. \nWe did not record a significant amount of impairment charges during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. \nGain or Loss on Asset Sales. \nWe did not record a significant gain or loss on asset sales during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\n47\nTable of Contents\nIncome from Operations.\n Our income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 by geographic regions was as follows ($ in millions): \n \nThree Months Ended September 30,\n$ Change\n% Change\n \n2025\n%\n2024\n%\nActual\nActual\nConstant\nCurrency\nAmericas\n$\n98 \n21 \n%\n$\n67 \n16 \n%\n$\n31 \n46 \n%\n46 \n%\nEMEA\n217 \n45 \n%\n219 \n52 \n%\n(2)\n(1)\n%\n— \n%\nAsia-Pacific\n159 \n34 \n%\n139 \n32 \n%\n20 \n14 \n%\n11 \n%\nTotal\n$\n474 \n100 \n%\n$\n425 \n100 \n%\n$\n49 \n12 \n%\n11 \n%\nAmericas Income from Operations.\n During the three months ended September 30, 2025, Americas income from operations increased by $31 million or 46% (46% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth. This was partially offset by higher costs of revenue, as described above.\nEMEA Income from Operations.\n Our EMEA income from operations did not materially change during the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nAsia-Pacific Income from Operations.\n During the three months ended September 30, 2025, Asia-Pacific income from operations increased by $20 million or 14% (11% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to organic growth, offset by lower revenues from non-recurring services provided to our joint venture, as described above.\nInterest Income.\n Interest income was $53 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and was $35 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to interest income earned on a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nInterest Expense.\n Interest expense increased to $128 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 from $117 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the following debt issuances: \n•\nthe issuance of the 3.650% Euro Senior Notes due 2033 and the 1.558% Swiss Franc Senior Notes due 2029 in the third quarter of 2024; \n•\nthe issuance of the 3.250% Euro Senior Notes due 2031 and the 3.625% Euro Senior Notes due 2034 in the fourth quarter of 2024;\n•\nthe issuance of the 3.500% SGD Notes due 2030 in the first quarter of 2025;\n•\nthe issuance of the 3.250% Euro Senior Notes due 2029 and the 4.000% Euro Senior Notes due 2034 in the second quarter of 2025; and\n•\nthe issuance of the 2.900% SGD Notes due 2032 in the third quarter of 2025.\nThe increase to interest expense driven by debt issuances was partially offset by the repayment of the 2.625% Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the 1.250% Senior Notes and 1.000% Senior Notes in the third quarter of 2025.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we capitalized $26 million and $9 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. See Note 9 within the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nOther Income or Expense.\n We did not record a significant amount of other income or expense during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nGain or Loss on Debt Extinguishment.\n We did not record a significant amount of gain or loss on debt extinguishment during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nIncome Taxes.\n We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and QRSs for the tax years ending December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. As such, other than certain state income taxes and foreign income and withholding taxes, no provision for income taxes has been included for our REIT and QRSs in the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWe have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that may not be REIT compliant. \nU.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations, regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs, have been accrued, as necessary, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we recorded $25 million and $54 million of income tax expense, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 6.3% and 15.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance in Canada and the revaluation of the net deferred tax liabilities in Germany due to the tax rate reductions enacted in the current period. \nNet Income.\n Our net income increased by $78 million or 26% in the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024. This increase is driven by the factors described above. \nAdjusted EBITDA\n.\n We define adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, and gain or loss on asset sales. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income.

Growth in EMEA revenues was primarily due to:\n•\napproximately $9 million of incremental revenues generated from IBX data center expansion projects which were completed within the twelve months ended September 30, 2025; and\n•\nan increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. \nThe increase was partially offset by a decrease of $10 million in revenues from non-recurring services provided to our joint ventures.\nAsia-Pacific Revenues.\n During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Asia-Pacific revenues increased by $30 million or 2% (2% on a constant currency basis). Growth in Asia-Pacific revenues was primarily due to:\n•\napproximately $16 million of incremental revenues generated from IBX data center expansion projects which were completed within the twelve months ended September 30, 2025; and\n•\nan increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.\nThe increase was offset by a decrease of $77 million in revenues from non-recurring services provided to our joint ventures.\nCost of Revenues.\n Our cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 by geographic regions was as follows ($ in millions):\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n$ Change\n% Change\n \n2025\n%\n2024\n%\nActual\nActual\nConstant\nCurrency\nAmericas\n$\n1,369 \n42 \n%\n$\n1,316 \n40 \n%\n$\n53 \n4 \n%\n5 \n%\nEMEA\n1,206 \n36 \n%\n1,236 \n38 \n%\n(30)\n(2)\n%\n(3)\n%\nAsia-Pacific\n735 \n22 \n%\n719 \n22 \n%\n16 \n2 \n%\n2 \n%\nTotal\n$\n3,310 \n100 \n%\n$\n3,271 \n100 \n%\n$\n39 \n1 \n%\n1 \n%\nCost of Revenues\n($ in millions; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)\nAmericas Cost of Revenues.\n \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Americas cost of revenues increased by $53 million or 4% (5% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to: \n51\nTable of Contents\n•\n$20 million of higher costs to provide non-recurring services; and\n•\n$14 million of higher utilities costs, driven by increases in power consumption.\nThe remainder of the increase is driven by higher costs across various categories including compensation costs, office expenses and repairs and maintenance.\nEMEA Cost of Revenues.\n \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, EMEA cost of revenues decreased by $30 million or 2% (3% on a constant currency basis). The decrease in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to lower utilities costs as a result of decreases in power prices in Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The decrease was partially offset by higher costs across various categories including compensation costs, rent and facilities costs and repairs and maintenance.\nAsia-Pacific Cost of Revenues.\n During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased by $16 million or 2% (2% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to $8 million of higher depreciation expense driven by IBX data center expansions. The remainder of the increase is driven by higher costs across various categories including compensation, partially offset by lower utilities costs.\nWe expect cost of revenues to increase across all three regions in line with the growth of our business.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\n.

Additionally, given that our corporate headquarters is located in the U.S., we expect the Americas general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to continue to be higher than those of other regions.\n53\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring Charges. \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recorded restructuring charges of $17 million primarily related to severance and other employee costs. We did not record any restructuring charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 12 within the condensed consolidated financial statements. \nTransaction costs.\n For both the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we recorded transaction costs totaling $12 million. These transaction costs were incurred in connection with evaluating and completing acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures.

This was partially offset by higher costs of revenue and general and administrative expenses and the non-recurring gain recognized on the sale of the SV12x data center in the prior year, as described above.\nEMEA Income from Operations. \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, EMEA income from operations increased by $112 million or 20% (20% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, partially offset by lower utilities costs, as described above.\nAsia-Pacific Income from Operations. \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, Asia-Pacific income from operations increased by $20 million or 4% (3% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, offset by lower revenues as a result of non-recurring services provided to our joint ventures, as described above.\nInterest Income.\n Interest income was $152 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and was $88 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to interest income earned on a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as well as on the AMER 2 Loan further described in Note 5 within the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Expense.\n Interest expense increased to $385 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 from $331 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the following debt issuances:\n•\nthe issuance of the 5.500% Senior Notes due 2034 in the second quarter of 2024;\n•\nthe issuance of the 3.650% Euro Senior Notes due 2033 and the 1.558% Swiss Franc Senior Notes due 2029 in the third quarter of 2024;\n•\nthe issuance of the 3.250% Euro Senior Notes due 2031 and the 3.625% Euro Senior Notes due 2034 in the fourth quarter of 2024;\n•\nthe issuance of the 3.500% SGD Notes due 2030 in the first quarter of 2025; \n•\nthe issuance of the 3.250% Euro Senior Notes due 2029 and the 4.000% Euro Senior Notes due 2034 in the second quarter of 2025; and \n54\nTable of Contents\n•\nthe issuance of the 2.900% SGD Notes due 2032 in the third quarter of 2025.\nThe increase to interest expense driven by debt issuances was partially offset by the repayment of the 2.625% Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we capitalized $51 million and $27 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress.

Our effective tax rates were 9.4% and 15.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance in Canada and the revaluation of the net deferred tax liabilities in Germany due to the tax rate reductions enacted in the current period. \nNet Income.\n Our net income increased by $256 million or 31% in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024.

Accordingly, we also use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations.  \nNon-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. As such, we provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  \nInvestors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies.  \nOur primary non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Funds from Operations (“AFFO”), as described below. We present these measures to provide investors with additional tools to evaluate our results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. These measures exclude items which we believe are generally not relevant to assessing our long-term performance. Both measures eliminate the impacts of depreciation and amortization, which are derived from historical costs and we believe are not indicative of current or future expenditures, and other items for which the frequency and amount of charges can vary based on the timing and significance of individual transactions. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze our business effectively. \nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate the operating strength and performance of our core, ongoing business, without regard to our capital or tax structures. It also aids in assessing the performance of, making operating decisions for, and allocating resources to our operating segments. In addition to the uses described above, we believe this measure provides investors with a better understanding of the operating performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding:\n•\nincome tax expense\n•\ninterest income\n•\ninterest expense\n•\nother income or expense\n•\ngain or loss on debt extinguishment\n•\ndepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\n•\nstock-based compensation expense\n•\nrestructuring charges, which primarily include employee severance, facility closure costs, lease or other contract termination costs and advisory fees related to the realignment of our management structure, operations or products\n•\nimpairment charges\n•\ntransaction costs\n•\ngain or loss on asset sales\n56\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet income\n$\n374 \n$\n296 \n$\n1,084 \n$\n828 \nIncome tax expense\n25 \n54 \n112 \n147 \nInterest income\n(53)\n(35)\n(152)\n(88)\nInterest expense\n128 \n117 \n385 \n331 \nOther (income) expense\n— \n(7)\n(2)\n6 \n(Gain) loss on debt extinguishment\n— \n— \n(1)\n1 \nDepreciation, amortization, and accretion expense\n533 \n494 \n1,515 \n1,509 \nStock-based compensation expense\n130 \n122 \n370 \n348 \nRestructuring charges\n5 \n— \n17 \n— \nImpairment charges\n4 \n— \n5 \n— \nTransaction costs\n3 \n7 \n12 \n12 \n(Gain) loss on asset sales\n(1)\n— \n(1)\n(18)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,148 \n$\n1,048 \n$\n3,344 \n$\n3,076 \nFunds from Operations (\"FFO\") and AFFO\nAFFO is derived from Funds from Operations (FFO) calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Both FFO and AFFO are non-GAAP measures commonly used in the REIT industry. Although our measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies, we believe that the presentation of these measures provides investors with an additional tool for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the REIT industry. Additionally, AFFO is a performance measure used in certain of our employee incentive programs and we believe it is a useful measure in assessing our dividend paying capacity as it isolates the cash impact of certain income and expense items and considers the impact of recurring capital expenditures.\nWe define FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders excluding:\n•\ngain or loss from the disposition of real estate assets\n•\ndepreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets\n•\nadjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items\nWe define AFFO as FFO adjusted for:\n•\ndepreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets\n•\naccretion expense\n•\nstock-based compensation expense\n•\nstock-based charitable contributions\n•\nrestructuring charges, as described above\n•\nimpairment charges\n•\ntransaction costs \n•\nan adjustment to remove the impacts of straight-lining installation revenue  \n•\nan adjustment to remove the impacts of straight-lining rent expense  \n•\nan adjustment to remove the impacts of straight-lining contract costs  \n•\namortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums \n•\ngain or loss from the disposition of non-real estate assets \n•\ngain or loss on debt extinguishment \n•\nan income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes \n•\nrecurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues \n•\nnet income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax \n•\nadjustments from FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items \n57\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present reconciliations of FFO and AFFO to net income (in millions): \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nNet income\n$\n374 \n$\n296 \n$\n1,084 \n$\n828 \nNet (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests\n— \n1 \n1 \n1 \nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n374 \n297 \n1,085 \n829 \nAdjustments:\nReal estate depreciation\n324 \n308 \n933 \n930 \n(Gain) loss on disposition of real estate assets\n(1)\n(3)\n— \n(19)\nAdjustments for FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures\n10 \n7 \n25 \n19 \nFFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n707 \n$\n609 \n$\n2,043 \n$\n1,759 \n \n \nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n \n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nFFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n707 \n$\n609 \n$\n2,043 \n$\n1,759 \nAdjustments:\nInstallation revenue adjustment\n6 \n(1)\n16 \n(3)\nStraight-line rent expense adjustment\n1 \n4 \n9 \n15 \nContract cost adjustment\n(8)\n(6)\n(25)\n(16)\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts\n6 \n5 \n17 \n15 \nStock-based compensation expense\n130 \n122 \n370 \n348 \nStock-based charitable contributions\n— \n— \n3 \n3 \nNon-real estate depreciation expense\n155 \n136 \n426 \n426 \n(Gain) loss on disposition of non-real estate assets\n(3)\n— \n(1)\n— \nAmortization expense\n51 \n52 \n149 \n155 \nAccretion expense adjustment\n3 \n(2)\n7 \n(2)\nRecurring capital expenditures\n(64)\n(69)\n(145)\n(135)\n(Gain) loss on debt extinguishment\n— \n— \n(1)\n1 \nRestructuring charges\n5 \n— \n17 \n— \nTransaction costs\n3 \n7 \n12 \n12 \nImpairment charges\n4 \n— \n5 \n— \nIncome tax expense adjustment\n(29)\n10 \n(19)\n14 \nAdjustments for AFFO from unconsolidated joint ventures\n(2)\n(1)\n1 \n(6)\nAFFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n965 \n$\n866 \n$\n2,884 \n$\n2,586 \nConstant Currency Presentation\nOur revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, the U.S. dollar was weaker relative to the British pound and Euro, which resulted in a favorable foreign currency impact on revenue and operating income, and an unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, the U.S. dollar was stronger relative to the Australian dollar and Brazilian real, which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact on revenue and operating income, and a favorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Our constant currency presentation excludes the impact of our foreign currency cash flow hedging activities. Presenting \n58\nTable of Contents\nconstant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our results of operations. To present this information, our current period revenues and certain operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are used as exchange rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2025 with the nine months ended September 30, 2024).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash \nCustomer collections are our primary source of cash. We believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections. As of September 30, 2025, our principal sources of liquidity were $2.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. In addition to our cash balance, we had approximately $4.0 billion of additional liquidity available to us from our $4.0 billion revolving facility and general access to both public and private debt and equity capital markets. We also have additional liquidity available to us from our 2024 ATM program, under which we may offer and sell from time to time our common stock in \"at the market\" transactions on either a spot or forward basis. As of September 30, 2025, we had approximately $1.2 billion available for sale remaining under the 2024 ATM Program.\nWe believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities and external financing sources, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, distribution of dividends and completion of our publicly announced acquisitions, ordinary costs to operate the business, and expansion projects. \nAs we continue to grow, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions and joint ventures. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned, we may further increase the level of capital expenditure to support this growth as well as pursue additional business and real estate acquisitions or joint ventures, provided that we have or can access sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities. We may elect to access the equity or debt markets from time to time opportunistically, particularly if financing is available on attractive terms. We will continue to evaluate our operating requirements and financial resources in light of future developments.\nCash Flow \nOur net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 were as follows (in millions):\n \nNine Months Ended September 30,\n \n2025\n2024\nChange\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,767 \n$\n2,268 \n$\n499 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n(3,774)\n(2,826)\n(948)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n47 \n1,245 \n(1,198)\nOperating Activitie\ns \nNet cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues. Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, interest payments, other general corporate expenditures and taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $499 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by improved results of operations offset by increases in cash paid for costs and operating expenses.\nInvesting Activities \nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $948 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to:\n59\nTable of Contents\n•\n$796 million increase in capital expenditures;\n•\n$642 million increase in purchases of short-term investments;\n•\n$247 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets; and\n•\n$182 million increase from TIM Acquisition, net of cash acquired (see Note 4 within the condensed consolidated financial statements).\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n•\n$770 million increase in maturities of short-term investments; and\n•\n$134 million decrease in draw downs on the AMER 2 Loan receivable.\nFinancing Activities\n \nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by:\n•\n$1.2 billion decrease from repayment of senior notes; and\n•\n$877 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of shares under the 2024 ATM Program.\nThis decrease was partially offset by a $1.0 billion increase in proceeds from senior notes, net of debt discounts.\nMaterial Cash Commitments\nAs of September 30, 2025, our principal commitments were primarily comprised of:\n•\napproximately $16.6 billion of principal from our senior notes (gross of debt issuance costs and debt discounts);\n•\napproximately $3.9 billion of interest on mortgage payable, other loans payable, senior notes and term loans, based on their respective interest rates and recognized over the life of these instruments, and the credit facility fee for the revolving credit facility; \n•\n$704 million of principal from our term loans, mortgage payable and other loans payable (gross of debt issuance costs and debt discounts); \n•\napproximately $5.4 billion of total lease payments, which represents lease payments under finance and operating lease arrangements, including renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised;\n•\napproximately $6.7 billion of unaccrued capital expenditure contractual commitments, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open IBX data center expansion projects prior to making them available to customers for installation, the majority of which is payable within the next 12 months; and\n•\napproximately $2.0 billion of other non-capital purchase commitments, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods, services or arrangements to be delivered or provided during the remainder of 2025 and beyond, the majority of which is payable within the next two years.\nWe believe that our sources of liquidity, including our expected future operating cash flows, are sized to adequately meet both the near- and long-term material cash commitments for the foreseeable future. For further information on maturities of lease liabilities and debt instruments, see Notes 8 and 9, respectively, within the condensed consolidated financial statements. \nOther Contractual Obligations\nWe have additional future equity contributions and loan commitments to our joint ventures. For additional information, see the \"Equity Method Investments\" footnote within the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nAdditionally, we entered into lease agreements with various landlords primarily for data center spaces and ground leases which have not yet commenced as of September 30, 2025. For additional information, see “Maturities of Lease Liabilities” in Note 8 within the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n60\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our condensed consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Critical accounting policies for Equinix that affect our more significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements include accounting for income taxes, accounting for business combinations, accounting for impairment of goodwill and other intangibles assets, accounting for property, plant and equipment and accounting for leases, which are discussed in more detail under the caption \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, set forth in Part II Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q."
