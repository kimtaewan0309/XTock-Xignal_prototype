Through its subsidiaries, FET owns and operates high-voltage transmission facilities in the PJM Region and has a rate base of $8.5 billion. FET's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by FERC and applicable state regulatory authorities. FET and its subsidiaries have no direct employees. Each of these companies, however, relies on employees of their affiliates, including FESC, for the performance of necessary services. On January 1, 2024, PN and ME contributed their respective Class B equity interests of MAIT to FE, which were ultimately contributed to FET in exchange for a special purpose membership interest in FET.\nSo long as FE holds the FET special purpose membership interests, it will receive 100% of any Class B distributions made by MAIT.\nOn July 26, 2024, FE, VEPCO and Transource Energy, LLC, a subsidiary of AEP, entered into a joint proposal agreement in connection with PJM’s 2024 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan Open Window 1 process. Pursuant to such joint proposal agreement, FET, VEPCO and Transource Energy, LLC jointly proposed certain regional electric transmission projects for PJM's consideration during the Open Window process. On November 25, 2024, FET, Dominion High Voltage MidAtlantic, Inc., as affiliate of VEPCO, and Transource Energy, LLC, formed Valley Link, which is the holding company responsible for managing and executing any projects awarded by PJM, and entered into a limited liability agreement. On February 26, 2025, PJM selected certain of the joint proposed projects, which included approximately $3 billion in investments for Valley Link to both build new and upgrade existing transmission infrastructure.\nATSI owns high-voltage transmission facilities in PJM, which consist of 7,964 circuit miles of transmission lines with nominal voltages of 345 kV, 138 kV and 69 kV in Ohio and Pennsylvania and has a rate base of $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nMAIT owns high-voltage transmission facilities in PJM, which consist of 4,287 circuit miles of transmission lines with nominal voltages of 500 kV, 345 kV, 230 kV, 138 kV, 115 kV, 69 kV and 46 kV in Pennsylvania, and has a rate base of $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nTrAIL owns high-voltage transmission facilities in PJM, which consists of 269 circuit miles of transmission lines with nominal voltages of 500 kV, 345 kV, 230 kV, 138 kV, including a 500 kV transmission line extending approximately 150 miles from southwestern Pennsylvania through West Virginia to a point of interconnection with VEPCO in northern Virginia, and has a rate base of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nPATH was a proposed transmission line from West Virginia through Virginia into Maryland which PJM cancelled in 2012. In March 2024, PATH completed the process of terminating all of its FERC-jurisdictional rates and facilities, with the result that PATH no longer is a “public utility” and no longer is subject to FERC jurisdiction. FET and its non-affiliated joint venture partner are completing the process of terminating the PATH corporate entities.\nKATCo owns high-voltage transmission facilities formerly owned by WP in PJM, which consist of 1,696 circuit miles of transmission lines with nominal voltages of 500 kV, 345 kV, 230 kV, 138 kV, and 115 kV in Pennsylvania, and has a rate base of $0.5 billion as of December 31, 2024.

FirstEnergy’s reportable segments are as follows, and FirstEnergy continues to evaluate segment performance based on earnings attributable to FE from continuing operations:\nDistribution Segment, which consists of the Ohio Companies and FE PA;\nIntegrated Segment, which consists of MP, PE and JCP&L; and\nStand-Alone Transmission Segment, which consists of FE's ownership in FET and KATCo.\nFE and its subsidiaries are principally involved in the transmission, distribution and generation of electricity through its reportable segments: Distribution, Integrated and Stand-Alone Transmission.\nsegment, which consists of the Ohio Companies and FE PA, representing $11 billion in rate base as of December 31, 2024, distributes electricity through FirstEnergy’s electric operating companies in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Distribution segment serves approximately 4.3 million customers in Ohio and Pennsylvania across its distribution footprint and purchases power for its provider of last resort, SOS, standard service offer and default service requirements. The segment’s results reflect the costs of securing and delivering electric generation to customers, including the deferral and amortization of certain costs.\nsegment includes the distribution and transmission operations under JCP&L, MP and PE, as well as MP’s regulated generation operations, representing $9.6 billion in rate base as of December 31, 2024. The Integrated segment distributes electricity to approximately 2 million customers in New Jersey, West Virginia and Maryland across its distribution footprint; provides transmission infrastructure in New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and Virginia to transmit electricity and\noperates 3,604 MWs of regulated net maximum generation capacity located primarily in West Virginia and Virginia. The segment will also include MP and PE’s 50 MWs of solar generation at five sites in West Virginia once complete. The first two solar generation sites were completed and placed in service in January and September 2024, representing 24 MWs of net maximum generating capacity. The remaining three sites, once completed, are expected to provide 26 MWs of additional net maximum generation capacity.\nStand-Alone Transmission\nsegment, which consists of FE's ownership in FET and KATCo, representing $5.3 billion in rate base as of December 31, 2024, includes transmission infrastructure owned and operated by the Transmission Companies and used to transmit electricity. The segment’s revenues are primarily derived from forward-looking formula rates, pursuant to which the revenue requirement is updated annually based on a projected rate base and projected costs, which is subject to an annual true-up based on actual rate base and costs. The segment’s results also reflect the net transmission expenses related to the delivery of electricity on FirstEnergy’s transmission facilities. KATCo, which was a subsidiary of FET, became a wholly owned subsidiary of FE prior to the closing of the FET P&SA I and remains in the Stand-Alone Transmission segment. ",
  "item7_clean": "FirstEnergy will continue to engage its skilled, trained, talented and diverse team of employees to effectively implement its investment plans, seek opportunities for continuous improvement as it delivers safe, reliable and affordable electricity to our customers, and deliver value to its investors. It aims to do so through the following:\nEnhancing the focus on the customer.\nFirstEnergy has shifted more decision-making and accountability for our operations closer to our customers, regulators and employees doing the work. FirstEnergy’s new operating structure is organized as follows: Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia/Maryland and FirstEnergy’s Standalone Transmission properties. This structure fosters better execution at the business unit level.\nEmbracing a continuous improvement mindset.\nFirstEnergy is focused on operational excellence through strong execution of our capital investments to enhance the customer experience and support the energy transition, managing costs and keeping customer bills affordable and reducing regulatory lag.\nFirstEnergy is establishing a track record of strong execution. Operating effectively leads to strong, predictable results and enhances credibility with our stakeholders. In turn, FirstEnergy builds supportive relationships with regulators, customers and intervenors in an effort to drive positive rate outcomes that support recovery of its investments.\nIn order to achieve important regulatory milestones, FirstEnergy has an active regulatory calendar to support its regulated growth strategy and address the critical investments that support reliability and a smarter electric grid. This includes the following:\nOn March 16, 2023, JCP&L filed a base rate case in New Jersey, requesting a $185 million increase in base distribution revenues to support investments to strengthen the energy grid, enhance the customer experience and provide assistance to low-income and senior citizen customers. On February 1, 2024, JCP&L, joined by various parties, filed a stipulated settlement with the NJBPU resolving JCP&L’s request for a distribution base rate increase. The settlement, which was approved by the NJBPU on February 14, 2024, provides for an $85 million annual base distribution revenue increase for JCP&L, which became effective for customers on June 1, 2024.\nOn November 9, 2023, JCP&L filed a petition for approval of its EnergizeNJ with the NJBPU that would, among other things, support grid modernization, system resiliency and substation modernization in technologies designed to provide enhanced customer benefits. On February 14, 2024, the NJBPU approved the stipulated settlement between JCP&L and various parties, resolving JCP&L’s request for a distribution base rate increase. On February 27, 2024, as part of the stipulated settlement, JCP&L amended its pending EnergizeNJ petition following receipt of NJBPU approval of the base rate case settlement, to remove the high-priority circuits that are to be addressed in the first phase of its reliability improvement plan and to include the second phase of its reliability improvement plan that is expected to further address certain high-priority circuits that require additional upgrades. EnergizeNJ, if approved as amended, will result in the investment of approximately $930.5 million of total estimated costs over five years. JCP&L and various parties are engaged in settlement discussions with respect to the pending EnergizeNJ petition.\nOn December 1, 2023, JCP&L filed a petition with the NJBPU requesting approval of its EE&C Plan II, which covers the January 1, 2025 through June 30, 2027 period and had a proposed budget of approximately $964 million. On October\n30, 2024, the NJBPU approved the parties’ stipulation of settlement, wherein the parties agreed to a budget of approximately $817 million for EE&C Plan II, including $784 million of investments that will earn a return on equity of 9.6%, with an equity ratio of 52%, and will be recovered over 10 years.\nOn April 5, 2023, the Ohio Companies sought approval from the PUCO for their ESP V. The proposed plan would maintain an eight-year term beginning June 1, 2024, and continue riders recovering costs associated with distribution infrastructure investments and approved grid modernization investments. ESP V additionally proposed new riders that would support reliability, and included provisions supporting affordability and enhancing the customer experience. On May 15, 2024, the PUCO issued an order approving ESP V with modifications, which are described below in “Outlook - State Regulation - Ohio”. On June 14, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed an Application for Rehearing, which was denied by operation of law as the PUCO did not rule on the applications for rehearing within 30 days of filing. Due to the risks and uncertainty resulting from the Ohio Companies’ application for rehearing being denied by operation of law, on October 29, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed a notice of their intent to withdraw ESP V and proposed the terms under which they would resume operating under ESP IV, which was approved by the PUCO on December 18, 2024. On January 22, 2025, the PUCO approved the Ohio Companies’ ESP IV compliance tariffs with an effective date of February 1, 2025, at which point the Ohio Companies resumed operating under ESP IV with modifications, as described below in “Outlook - State Regulation - Ohio”.\nOn January 31, 2025, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO for ESP VI, which would begin concurrently with the effective date of any new base distribution rates resulting from the Ohio Companies’ pending base rate case and continue through May 31, 2028. ESP VI proposes to continue existing riders to support continued maintenance of the distribution system, and to reestablish riders to recover vegetation management and storm restoration expenses. ESP VI also includes provisions supporting affordability and enhancing the customer experience. The PUCO has scheduled a technical conference for March 12, 2025.\nOn April 12, 2024, the Ohio Companies and certain of the parties filed a stipulation that modified the Ohio Companies’ application for phase two of its grid modernization plan, which was approved by the PUCO on December 18, 2024. The stipulation provides for the deployment of approximately 1.4 million smart meters to the balance of the Ohio Companies’ customers. Phase two of the distribution grid modernization plan, as modified by the stipulation would be completed over a four-year budget period with estimated capital investments of approximately $421 million. On December 18, 2024, the PUCO approved the stipulation and implementation has since begun.\nOn May 31, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed their application for an increase in base distribution rates, based on a 2024 calendar year test period. The Ohio Companies requested a net increase in base distribution revenues of approximately $94 million with a return on equity of 10.8% and capital structures of 44% debt and 56% equity for CEI, 46% debt and 54% equity for OE, and 45% debt and 55% equity for TE, which reflects a roll-in of current riders such as DCR and AMI. The net increase represented a 1.5% average residential monthly bill increase. Key components of the base rate case filing include a proposal to change pension and OPEB recovery to the delayed recognition method and to implement a mechanism to establish a regulatory asset (or liability) to recover (or refund) net differences between the amount of pension and OPEB expense requested in the proceeding and the actual amount each year using this method. Additionally, the Ohio Companies requested recovery of certain incurred costs, including the impact of major storms, a program to convert streetlights to LEDs, and others. On June 14, 2024, the Ohio Companies filed supporting testimony and on July 31, 2024, filed an update with an adjusted net increase of base distribution revenues of approximately $190 million and to incorporate matters in the rate case as directed by the PUCO’s ESP V order. On December 18, 2024, the PUCO issued an order approving the Ohio Companies’ withdrawal of ESP V. On January 22, 2025, the PUCO approved the Ohio Companies’ revised ESP IV tariffs, effective February 1, 2025, at which time the Ohio Companies resumed operating under ESP IV. On January 27, 2025, the Ohio Companies notified the PUCO of their intention to update their application for an increase in base distribution rates to remove ESP V related provisions from the base rate case. The PUCO staff hired a third party auditor to assist in the review of the Ohio Companies’ base rate case filing and on February 21, 2025, PUCO staff and the third party auditor each filed their reports. The auditor’s report recommended adjustments which would result in a net increase of the Ohio Companies’ base distribution revenues of approximately $8 million with a return on equity of 9.63% and capital structures of 48.8% debt and 51.2% equity for each of the Ohio Companies. PUCO staff’s report takes limited positions on the auditor’s finding and recommendations and makes additional findings. The Ohio Companies plan to respond and file supplemental testimony by March 24, 2025.\nOn April 2, 2024, FE PA filed a base rate case with the PPUC seeking a net increase in base distribution revenues of approximately $502 million with a return on equity of 11.3% and capital structure of 46.2% debt and 53.8% equity, and which reflects a roll-in of several current riders such as DSIC, Tax Act, and smart meter. Additionally, FE PA requested an enhanced ten year vegetation management program and recovery of certain incurred costs, including the impact of major storms, COVID-19, a program to convert streetlights to LEDs, and others. On September 13, 2024, FE PA and the active parties to the proceeding filed a joint settlement agreement requesting that the administrative law judges\napprove FE PA’s requested distribution base rate case increase subject to the terms and conditions of the settlement, which includes, among other things, an annual net revenue increase of $225 million. Other key components of the settlement agreement include recovery of costs incurred for storms and COVID-19, additional cost recovery of ongoing storm costs, inspection and maintenance of overhead lines and transformers, and rate case expenses, as well as an enhanced vegetation management program. On October 15, 2024, the administrative law judges issued a decision recommending that the PPUC approve, without modification, the September 13, 2024 settlement agreement. On November 21, 2024, the PPUC unanimously approved the settlement agreement without modification and the rates became effective on January 1, 2025.\nOn July 22, 2024, FE PA filed its application with the PPUC seeking approval for the next phase of its LTIIP program, which is expected to result in approximately $1.6 billion in investments, with approximately $1.4 billion of such investments going in service during the five-year period beginning January 1, 2025 and ending December 31, 2029. FE PA’s application was approved by the PPUC on December 19, 2024, and implementation began in January 2025.\nOn January 13, 2023, MP and PE filed a request with the WVPSC seeking approval of new depreciation rates for existing and future capital assets. On August 22, 2023, the parties filed a unanimous settlement of the case recommending a $33 million annual increase in depreciation expense, effective April 1, 2024, but deferred issues related to a change in the net energy metering credit. An order was issued on March 26, 2024 approving the settlement without modification.\nOn January 23, 2024, MP, PE and various parties filed a joint settlement agreement with the WVPSC, which recommended a base rate increase of $105 million, inclusive of the $33 million increase in depreciation expense, but deferred issues related to a change in the net energy metering credit. Additionally, the settlement included a new low-income customer advocacy program, a pilot program for service reliability investments and recovery of costs related to storm restoration, retired generation assets and COVID-19. The settlement did not include the request to establish a regulatory asset (or liability) for recovery (or refund) associated with pension and OPEB expense, however, it did not preclude MP and PE from pursuing that in a future separate proceeding. An agreement on the net energy metering credit was subsequently submitted to the WVPSC and was materially approved as part of the base rate case order for rates effective March 27, 2024.\nWe believe that FirstEnergy represents a compelling investment. With sound capital allocation targeting reliability, resiliency, the energy transition and customer experience, and supported by constructive regulatory outcomes, FirstEnergy expects to finance the business at a lower cost of capital, allowing it to begin the virtuous cycle all over again at “Invest.”\nFirstEnergy aims to do this through a strengthened financial position. Since 2021, FirstEnergy has raised $7 billion in equity capital and issued $1.5 billion in convertible notes in May 2023 to significantly improve its balance sheet. The strength of FirstEnergy’s balance sheet supports its plan to fund Energize365 investments through organic internal cash flows and the issuance of debt rather than incremental equity. FirstEnergy has optimized its financing plan to retain flexibility in an uncertain interest rate environment. FirstEnergy has also taken steps to reduce potential volatility risk associated with its pension plan. In January 2025, FirstEnergy executed an additional pension lift-out transaction associated with over $652 million in pension obligations relating to its former competitive generation employees. This lift-out transaction, combined with the lift-out completed in 2023, removed approximately $1.4 billion in total pension plan assets and obligations associated with approximately 3,900 former competitive generation employees.\nFirstEnergy also expects to continue returning value to shareholders. In March 2024, the FE Board declared a $0.015 per share increase to the quarterly common stock dividend payable June 1, 2024, to $0.425 per share, which represents an approximate 6% increase compared to dividends declared in 2023. Modest dividend growth is expected to enable enhanced shareholder returns, while still allowing for continued substantial regulated investments. Dividend payments are subject to declaration by the FE Board, and future dividend decisions determined by the FE Board may be impacted by earnings growth, credit metrics and other business conditions.\nHB 6 and Related Investigations\nOn July 21, 2021, FE entered into a three-year DPA with the U.S. Attorney’s Office that, subject to court proceedings, resolves the U.S. Attorney’s Office investigation into FirstEnergy relating to FirstEnergy’s lobbying and governmental affairs activities concerning HB 6 related to the federal criminal allegations made in July 2020, against former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and other individuals and entities allegedly affiliated with Mr. Householder. Among other things under the DPA, FE paid a $230 million monetary penalty in 2021 and agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging FE with one count of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. The $230 million payment will neither be recovered in rates or charged to FirstEnergy customers, nor will FirstEnergy seek any tax deduction related to such payment. As of July 22, 2024, FirstEnergy had successfully completed the obligations required within the three-year term of the DPA. Under the DPA, FirstEnergy has an\nobligation to continue (i) publishing quarterly a list of all payments to 501(c)(4) entities and all payments to entities known by FirstEnergy operating for the benefit of a public official, either directly or indirectly; (ii) not making",
