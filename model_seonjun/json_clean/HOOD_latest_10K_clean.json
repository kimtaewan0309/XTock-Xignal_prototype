We are creating a modern financial services platform for everyone, regardless of their wealth, income, or background.\nOur mission is to democratize finance for all. We use technology to provide access to the financial system in a way that is simple and convenient for our customers. We believe investing should be familiar and welcoming, with a simple design and an intuitive interface, so that customers are empowered to achieve their goals. We started with a revolutionary, bold brand and design in the Robinhood app which makes investing approachable for millions. Over the last decade, we have disrupted and changed the industry, becoming the first U.S. retail broker to offer commission-free stock trading with no account minimums, which was subsequently adopted by the rest of the industry. In recent years, we have continued to build relationships with our customers by introducing new products and diversifying our services that further expand access to the financial system, including focusing on products and tools for more seasoned investors. Through these efforts, we believe we have made investing culturally relevant and understandable, and that our platform is enabling our customers to become long-term investors and take greater control of their finances.\nAt Robinhood, our values are in service of our customers. The following values describe the company that we aspire to become:\nRobinhood is a safety first company. We create with care, make changes thoughtfully, and obsess over details. We don’t compromise regulatory requirements to move fast, and when we see something amiss, we move quickly to correct it. We take risks responsibly with safety as the foundation of innovation.\nRadical Customer Focus\n. Customers are at the center of our company. We listen to them, design for their needs, and aim to make our user experience simple and intuitive. We put what’s best for customers at the center of decision-making. When there are customer pain points, we fix them quickly.\nParticipation Is Power\n. We empower a new generation of investors. We seek to enable everyone to participate in the financial system and we deliver products to help them accomplish their long-term financial goals. We educate and empower our customers and strive to make the financial industry more inclusive. We were founded on the ideal that the rich shouldn’t get a better deal, so we treat people fairly and strive to deliver exceptional value.\nWe’re all invested in the same mission. We earn the trust of our colleagues by being honest, inclusive, and transparent. We invite diverse perspectives, support each other, and engage in lively but kind debate in pursuit of our path forward. When decisions are made we move in unison with an ownership mentality. We hold ourselves accountable but never point the finger or evade responsibility, and we treat everyone with respect and grace.\nOur first instinct is to take action. We strive for improvement and push for progress; and when something is broken, we fix it. We are driven by impact and constantly go\nafter big opportunities. We are making Robinhood a place people want to be by investing in our employees, leveraging diverse perspectives, and rewarding top performance.\nFirst-Principles Thinking\n. We are inventors, dreamers, and problem solvers. We question assumptions and seek creative solutions rather than just following the crowd. We use data and experiments to inform our decisions, but we also make bold bets, challenge the status quo, and are often a first mover. And ultimately, we bravely do what’s right even when it’s scary and hasn’t been done before.\nLean and Disciplined.\nWe do more with less. We pursue operational excellence so that we can deliver exceptional value to customers. We set ambitious goals, monitor progress, and regularly benchmark our performance to increase efficiency and effectiveness. We are respectful of each other’s time, so when we change course we do so intentionally after weighing the tradeoffs.\nOur Products And Features\nWe understand that millions of our customers have used Robinhood to enter the financial markets for the first time, and we take our responsibility to them seriously. We are passionate about operating Robinhood in a way that aligns with customer interests, applicable regulations, and with our own mission to democratize finance for all. We continue to create an ecosystem of financial products and services that will enable people across the world to become investors. We believe our products can transform the relationship people have with the financial system and that the products on our roadmap will go a long way toward making that a reality.\nWe began by offering our customers the ability to buy and sell equities on a mobile-first platform and have since continued to expand our offerings to add new asset classes, products and features, while also growing internationally to better serve our customers. We designed our mobile platform to be an elegant, intuitive investing interface that provides our customers with trading functionality and market information such as historical prices, valuation multiples, recent news, analyst ratings, advanced charts, and more, at no additional cost. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we introduced Robinhood Legend. Built specifically for active traders, Robinhood Legend is a new powerful, sleek browser-based desktop trading platform that is fully customizable and available at no additional cost to anyone with a Robinhood account. We are in the process of scaling Robinhood Legend to all supported asset classes and capabilities, with the goal of making it the most state-of-the-art desktop platform for trading.\nEach capability we have added has been the result of a continuous focus on our customers’ needs and feedback, which has guided our product development decisions throughout our history.\nThe core tenet of the Robinhood offering—expanding access to our financial system through products that empower people to learn, participate, and grow—underpins each of our offerings. We remain focused on building the best products and ultimately aim to serve all of our customers’ financial needs.\n. Our platforms allow our customers to invest commission-free in U.S.-listed stocks and exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), as well as related options and American Depository Receipts (“ADR”).\nWe review eligibility for our customers who wish to trade options, including disclosure of investment experience and knowledge, investment objectives and financial information. Subject to approval from Robinhood, customers can access basic options strategies (Level 2), which permits buying calls and puts and selling covered calls and puts, or more advanced options strategies (Level 3), which permits fixed-risk spreads (such as credit spreads\nand iron condors) and other advanced trading strategies, depending on their individually disclosed preparedness. We conduct regular reviews of our customers’ eligibility and take action to revoke access to trading options as appropriate, to ensure our customers are accessing the level of options strategies that are appropriate for them based on information such as their trading experience, investment objectives and financial situation. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced index option trading and made it available to all customers in January 2025. Index option trading allows our customers to trade options on diversified indices like the S&P 500 and VIX, while gaining access to potential tax benefits and one of the lowest contract fees among leading brokerages.\n. Fractional trading allows customers to invest in fractions of a share of stock, rather than requiring them to buy and sell whole shares. This service enables customers to build a diversified portfolio regardless of their budget and removes a barrier to investing in higher-priced stocks, thereby providing access to a much greater selection of equities with as little as $1.\nRecurring Investments.\nOur recurring investment feature enables our customers to automatically buy shares of equities and certain ETFs on a set schedule, allowing them to build positions over time and establish regular investing habits, even with small contributions. Our customers can also elect to automatically reinvest dividend income back into the underlying respective shares.\nAccess to Investing on Margin.\nSubject to approval upon meeting eligibility criteria set by Robinhood, customers can invest on margin. This allows eligible customers to borrow a limited amount of funds from Robinhood to use as additional investing capital. Robinhood decides whether to extend margin to each customer who applies for access based on information regarding customer activity, portfolio equity or net worth criteria, investment objectives, and investing experience reported by the customer. In 2024, we began to offer an industry-leading tiered margin structure where customers now receive a single low interest rate based on their total margin balance, replacing the floating interest rate that was offered previously.\nFully-Paid Securities Lending.\nUnder our Fully-Paid Securities Lending program (“Fully-Paid Securities Lending”), a customer can earn passive income on their stock portfolio once they give Robinhood permission to lend out any fully paid stocks in their portfolio. Robinhood does the work of finding interested borrowers and customers get paid a share of the interest revenue earned when their shares have been loaned to borrowers.\n. Our cash sweep program (“Cash Sweep”) provides additional value to our brokerage customers by allowing them to earn interest on uninvested brokerage cash swept to our partner banks. The interest compounds daily and is then paid out by the partner banks monthly, with customers able to track how much they’ve earned directly within the app. Cash deposited at these banks is eligible for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance.\n. Our instant withdrawals feature enables eligible customers to withdraw money from their Robinhood accounts and instantly deposit it to their bank accounts or debit cards with a fee.\nRobinhood Retirement.\nWe are making it easy and accessible to start saving for retirement through a traditional Individual Retirement Account (“IRA”) or Roth IRA and are expanding options for the growing population of freelance and gig workers without access to employer-based matching programs. Customers’ eligible contributions to their retirement account can earn a percentage match by Robinhood, subject to a five-year holding period. We offer customer IRA instant deposits up to $1,000, which allows customers to immediately start investing. Customers can also get a custom recommended portfolio, build their own, or do both, all commission-free.\n. We were the first U.S. broker to offer around-the-clock trading of individual stocks, 24 hours a day, 5 days a week. We also offer around-the-clock trading of ETFs. It allows our customers to better manage their risk and take advantage of opportunities, no matter what time of day they arise.\nJoint Investing Accounts.\nOur joint investing accounts allow customers to seamlessly manage investments with their partner while keeping their shared assets in one place. The joint account provides shared access for account holders that allows them to combine funds and increase their investment power as they work towards their financial goals. Gold Subscribers can also extend certain Robinhood Gold benefits to a joint account at no additional cost.\nAn event contract is a type of financial derivative that allows traders to speculate on the outcome of a specific event. These contracts are generally structured around “Yes” or “No” outcomes, and fluctuate in price based on the projected outcome of the event. Event contracts then pay out if the position held matches the co",

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section presents management’s perspective on our financial condition and results of operations, including performance metrics that management uses to assess company performance. The following discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement data and information presented elsewhere in this Annual Report, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes elsewhere in this Annual Report. It is also intended to provide you with information that will assist you in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. To the extent that this discussion describes prior performance, the descriptions relate only to the periods listed, which might not be indicative of our future financial outcomes. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause results to differ materially from management’s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”\nWe refer to our “users” and our “customers” interchangeably throughout this Annual Report to refer to individuals who hold accounts on our platforms.\nKey Performance Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nWe define a Funded Customer as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and, within the past 45 calendar days (a) had an account balance that was greater than zero (excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) or (b) completed a transaction using any such account. Individuals who share a funded joint investing account (which launched in July 2024) are each considered to be a Funded Customer.\nAssets Under Custody (“AUC”)\n: We define AUC as the sum of the fair value of all equities, options, cryptocurrency, futures (including options on futures, swaps, and event contracts), and cash held by users in their accounts, net of receivables from users, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis. Net Deposits and net market gains (losses) drive the change in AUC in any given period.\nWe define Net Deposits as all cash deposits and asset transfers from customers, as well as dividends, interest, and cash or assets earned in connection with Company promotions (such as account transfer and retirement match incentives and free stock bonuses) received by customers, net of reversals, customer cash withdrawals, margin interest, Gold subscription fees, and assets transferred off of our platforms for a stated period. Prior to the second quarter of 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from cash or assets earned in connection with Company promotions and prior to January 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from dividends and interest or outflows from Robinhood Gold subscription fees and margin interest, although we have not restated amounts in prior periods as the impact to those figures was immaterial.\nAverage Revenue Per User (“ARPU”)\n: We define ARPU as total revenue for a given period divided by the average number of Funded Customers on the last day of that period and the last day of the immediately preceding period.\nWe define a Gold Subscriber as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and who, as of the end of the relevant period (a) is subscribed to Robinhood Gold and (b) has made at least one Robinhood Gold subscription fee payment.\nAutomated Customer Account Transfer Service (“ACATS”)\n: A system that automates and standardizes procedures for the transfer of assets in a customer account from one brokerage firm and/or bank to another.\n: We define Cash Sweep as the period-end total amount of participating users’ uninvested brokerage cash that has been automatically “swept” or moved from their brokerage accounts into deposits for their benefit at a network of program banks. This is an off-balance-sheet amount. Robinhood earns a net interest spread on Cash Sweep balances based on the interest rate offered by the banks less the interest rate given to users as stated in our program terms.\nA Funded Customer is considered “Churned” if it was ever a New Funded Customer whose account balance (measured as the fair value of assets in the account less any amount due from the user and excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) drops to or below zero and has not completed a transaction using any account with a Robinhood entity for at least 45 consecutive calendar days. Negative balances typically result from Fraudulent Deposit Transactions (which occur when users initiate deposits into their accounts, make trades on our platforms using a short-term extension of credit from us, and then repatriate or reverse the deposits, resulting in a loss to us of the credited amount) and unauthorized debit card use, and less often, from margin loans.\nGrowth Rate with respect to Net Deposits:\nGrowth rate is calculated as aggregate Net Deposits over a specified 12 month period, divided by AUC for the fiscal quarter that immediately precedes such 12 month period.\nInvestment Accounts:\nWe define an Investment Account as a funded individual brokerage account, a funded joint investing account, or a funded individual retirement account (“IRA”). As of\n, a Funded Customer can have up to four Investment Accounts - individual brokerage account, joint investing account (which launched in July 2024), traditional IRA, and Roth IRA.\nWe define Margin Book as our period-end aggregate outstanding margin loan balances receivable (i.e., the period-end total amount we are owed by customers on loans made for the purchase of securities, supported by a pledge of assets in their margin-enabled brokerage accounts).\nNew Funded Customers:\nWe define a New Funded Customer as a unique person who became a Funded Customer for the first time during the relevant period.\nNotional Trading Volume:\nWe define Notional Trading Volume for any specified asset class as the aggregate dollar value (purchase price or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that asset class over a specified period of time.\nOptions Contracts Traded:\nWe define Options Contracts Traded as the total number of options contracts bought or sold over a specified period of time. Each contract generally entitles the holder to trade 100 shares of the underlying stock.\nResurrected Customers:\nA Funded Customer is considered “Resurrected” in a stated period if it was a Churned Customer as of the end of the immediately preceding period and its balance (excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) rises above zero or it completes a transaction using its account.\nWith respect to the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023:\ntotal net revenues increased 58% to $2.95 billion compared to $1.87 billion;\nnet income was $1.41 billion, or diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $1.56, compared to a net loss of $0.54 billion, or diluted EPS of -$0.61. Net income included the impact of:\na $369 million deferred tax benefit, primarily from the release of the Company's valuation allowance on most of its net deferred tax assets;\na $55 million benefit due to a reversal of an accrual as part of a regulatory settlement.\nThe year ended December 31, 2023 included an expense of $485 million from the 2021 Founders Award Cancellation (the “2021 Founders Award Cancellation”);\ntotal operating expenses decreased\n$1.90 billion compared to $2.40 billion;\nSBC expense decreased\n$304 million compared to $871 million;\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) increased 167% to $1.43 billion compared to\nFunded Customers increased 8% to 25.2 million compared to 23.4 million and Investment Accounts increased by 10% to 26.2 million compared to 23.8 million;\nAUC increased 88% to\n$102.6 billion, driven by continued Net Deposits and higher equity and cryptocurrency valuations;\n$50.5 billion, which\ntranslates to a growth rate of 49% relative to AUC at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to\n$17.1 billion, which translates to\na growth rate of 27% relative to AUC at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022;\nARPU increased 53% to\nincreased 86% to 2.64 million compared to 1.42 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information about Adjusted EBITDA, including the definition and limitations of such measure, and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, please see “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nPending Business Acquisitions\nIn June 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire all outstanding equity of Bitstamp, a globally-scaled cryptocurrency exchange with retail and institutional customers, for an aggregate consideration of approximately $200 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments and payable in cash.\nIn November 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire all outstanding equity of TradePMR, a custodial and portfolio management platform for registered investment advisors, for cash consideration of approximately $180 million and post-close equity compensation of approximately $120 million, for aggregate consideration and post-close compensation of approximately $300 million. The purchase consideration is subject to customary purchase price adjustments.\nBoth pending acquisitions are subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and are expected to close in the first half of 2025.\nKey Performance Metrics\nKey performance metrics for the relevant periods were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\nAUC\nGrowth Rate with respect to Net Deposits\nARPU\nThe following table describes the annual changes within Funded Customers:\nYear Ended December 31,\nBeginning Funded Customers\nNew Funded Customers\nResurrected Customers\nEnding Funded Customers\nThe following table sets out the components of AUC by type of asset:\nYear Ended December 31,\nCash held by Customers\nReceivables from Customers (primarily margin balances)\nAUC\nFutures consists of futures, options on futures, and swaps, including event contracts, which we launched during the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe following table describes the changes within AUC:\nYear Ended December 31,\nNet market gains (losses)\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources and assess our performance. In addition to total net revenues, net income (loss), and other results under GAAP, we utilize non-GAAP calculations of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding (i) interest expenses related to credit facilities, (ii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) SBC, (v) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (vi) other significant gains, losses, and expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing results. This non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nThe above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by\nour management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss):\nYear Ended December 31,\nInterest expenses related to credit facilities\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\nDepreciation and amortization\n2021 Founders Award Cancellation\nSBC Excluding 2021 Founders Award Cancellation\nSignificant legal and tax settlements and reserves\nRestructuring charges\nQ4 2022 Processing Error\nImpairment of Ziglu equity securities\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, SBC excluding 2021 Founders Award Cancellation benefited from restructuring-related net reversals of previously recognized expense of $77 million in connection with both the April 2022 Restructuring and August 2022 Restructuring.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, significant legal and tax settlements and reserves included a $55 million benefit due to a reversal of an accrual as part of a regulatory settlement.\nRestructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to both the April 2022 Restructuring and August 2022 Restructuring, consisting of $45 million of impairment and $9 million of accelerated depreciation, in each case relating to office closures, and $51 million of cash charges for employee-related wages, benefits and severance. Refer to Note 6 - Restructuring Activities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further information.\nQ4 2022 Processing Error was due to delays in notification from third parties and process failures within Robinhood’s brokerage systems and operations in connection with the handling of a 1-for-25 reverse stock split transaction of Cosmos Health, Inc.\nPartially as a result of the termination of the stock purchase agreement, the advances made to Ziglu accounted for as non-marketable equity securities were impaired to a carrying value of zero.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nTransaction-Based Revenues\nTransaction-based revenues consist of amounts earned from routing customer orders for options, cryptocurrencies, and equities to market makers. When customers place orders for options, cryptocurrencies, or equities on our platform, we route these orders to market makers and we receive consideration from those market makers. With respect to options and equities trading, such fees are known as PFOF. With respect to cryptocurrencies trading, we receive “Transaction Rebates” when routing to market makers. In the case of options, our fee is on a per contract basis based on the underlying security. For equities, the fees we receive are typically based on the size of the publicly quoted bid-ask spread for the security being traded; that is, we receive a fixed percentage of the difference between the publicly quoted bid and ask at the time the trade is executed. In the case of cryptocurrencies, our rebate is a fixed percentage of the notional order value.\nWithin each asset class, whether options, cryptocurrencies, or equities, the transaction-based revenue we earn is calculated in an identical manner among all participating market makers. We route\noption and equity orders in priority to part",
