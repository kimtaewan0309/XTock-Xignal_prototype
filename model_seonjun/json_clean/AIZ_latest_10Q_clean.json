In Connected Living, results benefited from contributions from a new financial services program, as well as global subscriber growth and trade-in performance in mobile. In Global Automotive, results included a non-run rate benefit of $6.1 million and improved loss experience.\nGlobal Lifestyle net earned premiums, fees and other income\nincreased $156.7 million, or 7%, to $2.41 billion for Third Quarter 2025 from $2.25 billion for Third Quarter 2024, primarily driven by Connected Living growth from mobile protection and trade-in programs, and a new program in financial services, as well as contributions from Global Automotive.\nGlobal Housing Adjusted EBITDA\nincreased $163.9 million, or 177%, to $256.3 million for Third Quarter 2025 from $92.4 million for Third Quarter 2024. Results included $133.9 million of lower pre-tax reportable catastrophes. Excluding reportable catastrophes, Adjusted EBITDA increased $30.0 million, or 13%, driven by the previously disclosed $27.5 million unfavorable non-run rate adjustment in Third Quarter 2024. Underlying results were driven by favorable non-catastrophe loss experience, including lower claims frequency, and top-line growth, including higher lender-placed policies in-force which benefitted from voluntary insurance market pressure, partially offset by lower favorable prior-period reserve development.\nGlobal Housing net earned premiums, fees and other income\nincreased $99.1 million, or 16%, to $702.9 million for Third Quarter 2025 from $603.8 million for Third Quarter 2024, driven by the aforementioned run-rate adjustment from the prior year period, growth in policies in-force and higher average premiums within lender-placed, as well as growth in Renters and Other and across various specialty products within Homeowners.\nCorporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA\ndecreased $1.8 million, or 6%, to $(31.6) million for Third Quarter 2025 from $(29.8) million for Third Quarter 2024, driven by lower net investment income.\nCritical Factors Affecting Results\nOur results depend on, among other things, the appropriateness of our product pricing, underwriting, the accuracy of our reserving methodology for future policyholder benefits and claims, the frequency and severity of reportable and non-reportable catastrophes, returns on and values of invested assets, our investment income, and our ability to realize greater operational efficiencies and manage our expenses. Our results also depend on our ability to profitably grow our businesses, including our Connected Living, Global Automotive, and Renters and Other businesses, and the performance of our Homeowners business. Factors affecting these items, including tariffs, consumer demand and global supply chain disruptions, conditions in the financial markets, the global economy and recessionary pressures, political conditions and the markets in which we operate, fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation (which have impacted claims costs), may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Tariff policies in the U.S. and abroad could impact claims costs and may affect consumer demand for certain products. For more information on these and other factors that could affect our results, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors” below and in our 2024 Annual Report, and “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Factors Affecting Results” in our 2024 Annual Report.\nOur results may also be impacted by our ability to continue to grow in the markets in which we operate, which will be impacted by our ability to provide a superior customer experience, including from our investments in technology and digital initiatives, to capitalize on the connected home opportunity, and to onboard and ramp-up new business. Our mobile business is subject to volatility in mobile device trade-in volumes and margins based on the actual and anticipated timing of the release of new devices, carrier promotional programs and sales prices for used devices, as well as to changes in consumer preferences. Our Homeowners revenue is impacted by changes in the housing market, as well as the voluntary insurance market. In addition, across many of our businesses, we must respond to competitive pressures, including the threat of disruption and competition for talent, which has increased due to labor shortages and wage inflation. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Business, Strategic and Operational Risks—\nSignificant competitive pressures, changes in customer preferences and disruption could adversely affect our results of operations\nOur mobile business is subject to the risk of declines in the value and availability of mobile devices, and to regulatory compliance and other risks\nThe success of our business depends on the execution of our strategy, including through the continuing service of key executives, senior leaders, highly-skilled personnel and a high-performing workforce\n” in our 2024 Annual Report.\n\nFees and other income\nNet investment income\nNet realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities\nBenefits, losses and expenses:\nPolicyholder benefits\nUnderwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nTotal benefits, losses and expenses\nIncome before provision for income taxes\nProvision for income taxes\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nincreased $131.8 million, or 99%, to $265.6 million for Third Quarter 2025 from $133.8 million for Third Quarter 2024, primarily due to $107.6 million of lower after-tax reportable catastrophes and higher Global Housing and Global Lifestyle earnings.

The increase in net income was partially offset by a higher annualized effective tax rate, mainly due to higher transferable tax credits and a tax benefit for the release of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets recorded in the prior year, and $12.1 million of lower after-tax gain related to benefit plan activity due to the termination of the retirement health benefits plan on December 31, 2024.\n\nFees and other income\nNet investment income\nBenefits, losses and expenses\nPolicyholder benefits\nSelling and underwriting expenses\nTotal benefits, losses and expenses\nGlobal Lifestyle Adjusted EBITDA\nNet earned premiums, fees and other income:\nNet earned premiums, fees and other income:\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nincreased $22.5 million, or 12%, to $206.8 million for Third Quarter 2025 from $184.3 million for Third Quarter 2024, primarily driven by contributions from a new financial services program, mobile subscriber growth and performance of global mobile trade-in programs within Connected Living, as well as growth in Global Automotive, including a non-run rate benefit of $6.1 million and improved loss experience.\nincreased $159.2 million, or 7%, to $2.50 billion for Third Quarter 2025 from $2.34 billion for Third Quarter 2024.
