These companies compete across geographic boundaries and provide customers with meaningful alternatives to traditional banking services in nearly all significant products. The increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology, product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. These competitive trends are likely to continue.\nHuman Capital Resources\nThe Bancorp’s human capital strategy is designed to attract, develop and retain talent. This strategy ensures that Fifth Third has the talent, capabilities and organizational structure to support business needs now and in the future.

The Bancorp’s holistic approach to collecting, measuring and responding to employee feedback enhances the employee experience at critical points during times of change in business or work environments. Feedback is collected through a variety of methods, including the Employee Viewpoints Survey, which includes questions related to culture, engagement, inclusion, employee well-being, expectations and intent to stay.\nThe Bancorp’s learning, development and career mobility strategy delivers personalized and accessible experiences that fuel career growth and help retain talent. In response to employee feedback, Fifth Third continued its focus on career mobility with enhanced tools to support internal career pathing. This includes a robust suite of learning resources covering several areas, including leadership and professional development to foster learning and career advancement across the employee population. In 2024, employees engaged in over 255,000 hours of discretionary learning.\nSeveral new initiatives were introduced, including a comprehensive onboarding program for new managers, a high performing program for senior leaders, and new offerings aimed at developing the professional and leadership skills necessary to build a strong pipeline of leaders. Fifth Third leaders engaged in 2,800 different development offerings. Fifth Third’s commitment to compliance and risk management also remains strong, with all employees and contingent workers completing more than 475,000 course hours on these topics.\nTotal Rewards – Compensation and Benefits\nThe Bancorp is committed to providing competitive compensation programs that attract and retain top talent, while driving the business strategy and effectively managing risk. Fifth Third’s compensation programs are designed to reward performance and align with regulatory expectations while reflecting the Bancorp’s values and behavioral standards. The Bancorp’s compensation philosophy is centered on creating long-term shareholder value.\nFifth Third continuously analyzes its compensation programs to ensure all employees have equal opportunities to maximize their potential.

In addition to traditional benefits offerings, the Bancorp provides comprehensive support with unique programs focused on the financial, physical, emotional and social well-being of employees.\nRecruitment and Retention\nThe Bancorp continues to navigate the changing talent landscape by monitoring the external environment and adapting talent strategies to meet internal needs. The Bancorp’s focus on its employee value proposition demonstrates a continued commitment to employees by developing great leaders and evolving the employee experience. Full year turnover improved, decreasing from 16.9% in 2023 to 16.2% in 2024.\nThe Bancorp’s recruitment strategies enhance the organization by promoting an inclusive culture. To attract the most talented employees, the Bancorp continues to enhance relationships with universities and partner organizations to attract top talent. Creating and developing an inclusive workforce is important for the Bancorp’s business growth, leading to enhanced innovation while focusing on the needs of its customers.\nAcquisitions and Investments\nThe Bancorp’s strategy for growth includes strengthening its presence in core markets, expanding its presence in high-growth markets and broadening its product offerings. In order to take into account the integration and other risks, the Bancorp conducts due diligence to evaluate and identify the risks associated with possible transactions. As a result, discussions, and in some cases, negotiations regarding acquisitions and investments may take place and future transactions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur. These typically involve the payment of a premium over book value and current market price, and therefore, some dilution of tangible book value and net income per share may occur with any future transactions.\n17 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nVII, including rules related to internal and external business conduct standards, reporting, recordkeeping, mandatory clearing for certain swaps and trade documentation and confirmation requirements. In addition, the U.S. banking regulators have finalized regulations applicable to the Bank regarding mandatory posting, collection and segregation of margin by certain swap counterparties and capital requirements. The Bank is not registered as a security-based swap dealer.\nBroker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation\nFifth Third’s broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the SEC. Financial Industry Regulation Authority (“FINRA”) is the primary self-regulatory organization for Fifth Third’s registered broker-dealer subsidiary. Fifth Third’s broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries also are subject to additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions. The SEC and FINRA have active enforcement functions that oversee broker-dealers and investment advisers and can bring actions that result in fines, restitution, limitation on permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. In addition, certain changes in the activities of a broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, and FINRA considers a variety of factors in acting upon applications for such approval, including internal controls, capital levels, management experience and quality, prior enforcement and disciplinary history and supervisory concerns.\nConsumer Protection Regulation and Supervision\nThe Bancorp is subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws. The Bancorp is also subject to certain state consumer protection laws, and under Dodd-Frank, state attorneys general and other state officials are empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations. State authorities have increased their focus on and enforcement of consumer protection rules. These federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of our activities and to various aspects of our business and include laws relating to interest rates, fair lending, disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers, debt collection practices, the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies, and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services.\nThe CFPB has promulgated many mortgage-related final rules since it was established under Dodd-Frank, including rules related to the ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requirements and appraisal and escrow standards for higher priced mortgages. The mortgage-related final rules issued by the CFPB have materially restructured the origination, servicing and securitization of residential mortgages in the U.S. These rules have impacted, and will continue to impact, the business practices of mortgage lenders, including the Bancorp.\nFuture Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives\nFederal and state legislators as well as regulatory agencies may introduce or enact new laws and rules, or amend existing laws and rules, that may affect the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies. The regulatory agencies may seek to apply higher standards to the Bancorp and the Bank than as required by law, through supervision. The impact of any future legislative or regulatory changes, or supervisory direction, cannot be predicted. However, such changes could affect the Bancorp’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n24 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nRegulation and Supervision\nIn addition to the generally applicable state and federal laws governing businesses and employers, the Bancorp and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their parent companies. Virtually all aspects of the business of the Bancorp and the Bank are subject to specific requirements or restrictions and general regulatory oversight. The principal objectives of state and federal banking laws and regulations and the supervision, regulation and examination of banks and their parent companies (such as the Bank and the Bancorp) by bank regulatory agencies are the maintenance of the safety and soundness of financial institutions, the maintenance of the federal deposit insurance system and the protection of consumers or classes of consumers, rather than the protection of shareholders or debtholders of a bank or the parent company of a bank. The Bancorp and its subsidiaries are subje",
  "item7_clean": "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSTATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS\nNet interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest incurred on core deposits and wholesale funding (including CDs over $250,000, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders’ equity.\nTables 6 and 7 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses included in average other assets.\nNet interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreasing $198 million compared to the prior year. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was negatively impacted by lower average loan balances as a result of actions taken in 2023 to reduce lower returning facilities as well as decreased demand. Additionally, funding costs remained elevated as higher average market rates continued to drive deposit balance migration into higher yielding products. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher yields on average interest-earning assets and an increase in the average balances of other short-term investments.\nNet interest rate spread on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.08% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2.24% during the year ended December 31, 2023. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased 42 bps, partially offset by a 26 bps increase in yields on average interest-earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNet interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was 2.90% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 3.05% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily impacted by the previously mentioned impacts of higher market interest rates, migration of average balances of deposits from demand deposits to interest-bearing deposits and a decrease in the average balances of loans and leases. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by elevated balances of other short-term investments during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW\nThe Bancorp has three reportable segments: Commercial Banking, Consumer and Small Business Banking and Wealth and Asset Management. Additional information on each segment is included in Note 31 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorp’s segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices, which are specific to the Bancorp. Therefore, the financial results of the Bancorp’s segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management’s accounting practices and businesses change.\nThe Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. By employing an FTP methodology, the segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. The FTP methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of the cash flows for each transaction. Assigning the FTP rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. The Bancorp’s FTP methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. As the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other. The charge and credit rates are determined using the FTP rate curve, which is based on an estimate of Fifth Third’s marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. The FTP curve is constructed using the U.S. swap curve, brokered CD pricing and unsecured debt pricing.\nThe Bancorp adjusts the FTP charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. Key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. Credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. In general, the charge rates on assets increased since December 31, 2023 as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. The credit rates for deposit products decreased modestly since December 31, 2023 due to modified assumptions and decreasing short-term rates. As a result, net interest income for each segment was negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2024 as a result of these updates to FTP charge and credit rates.\nThe Bancorp’s methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each segment. Provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in ALLL factors is captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses, which are included within other noninterest expense. Additionally, the segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.\nThe following table summarizes income (loss) before income taxes on an FTE basis by segment:\nTABLE 15: Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes (FTE) by Segment\nFor the years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\nIncome Statement Data\n\nAmounts presented on an FTE basis. The FTE adjustments were $24, $25 and $16 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThese are non-GAAP measures. For further information, refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD&A.\nThe Bancorp’s net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $2.2 billion, or $3.14 per diluted share, which was net of $159 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorp’s net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2.2 billion, or $3.22 per diluted share, which was net of $137 million in preferred stock dividends.\nNet interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreasing $198 million compared to the prior year. Net interest income was negatively impacted by higher funding costs due to increases in market interest rates and deposit balance migration into higher yielding products as well as a decrease in the average balances of commercial and industrial loans for the year ended December 31, 2024. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher yields on average interest-earning assets and an increase in the average balances of other short-term investments.\nNet interest margin on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) was\nfor the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe provision for credit losses was $530 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $515 million in the prior year. Provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was affected by the impacts of deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast for the commercial portfolio, higher period-end loan and lease balances and increases in specific reserves on individually evaluated commercial loans, partially offset by the impacts of changes in consumer loan portfolio mix, improvement in the macroeconomic forecast for the consumer loan portfolio and improvements in probability of default ratings on commercial loans. Net losses charged off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 0.45% and 0.32% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and OREO increased to 0.71% compared to 0.59% at December 31, 2023. For further discussion on credit quality, refer to the Credit Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A as well as Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNoninterest income decreased $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to decreases in other noninterest income, mortgage banking net revenue and commercial banking revenue, partially offset by increases in wealth and asset management revenue and commercial payments revenue.\n49 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nNet interest margin results are expected to modestly increase over the next several quarters driven by fixed-rate asset repricing and moderating deposit costs. However, net interest margin may be negatively impacted by increased deposit competition or higher levels of cash and other short-term investments.\nInterest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from loans and leases increased $142 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in yields on loans and leases, partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of commercial and industrial loans. For more information on the Bancorp’s loan and lease portfolio, refer to the Loans and Leases subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A. Interest income on an FTE basis (non-GAAP) from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $523 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the average balances of other short-term investments and higher yields on average taxable securities driven by fixed-rate asset repricing.\nInterest expense on average core deposits increased $852 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 287 bps for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 238 bps for the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of a mix shift from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing deposit products, higher short-term interest rates and an increase in the average balances of interest-bearing core deposits. Refer to the Deposits subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the Bancorp’s deposits.\nInterest expense on average wholesale funding increased $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in the average balances of and yields on long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of FHLB advances. Refer to the Borrowings subsection of the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the Bancorp’s borrowings. During the year ended December 31, 2024, average wholesale funding represented 16% of average interest-bearing liabilities compared to 18% for the year ended December 31, 2023. For more information on the Bancorp’s interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, refer to the Interest Rate and Price Risk Management subsection of the Risk Management section of MD&A.\n57 Fifth Third Bancorp\n\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nindirect secured consumer loans, partially offset by a decrease in net charge-offs on commercial and industrial loans.\nNet charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases were 68 bps for both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nNoninterest income decreased $11 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by a decrease in mortgage banking net revenue, partially offset by an increase in wealth and asset management revenue. Refer to the Noninterest Income subsection of the Statements of Income Analysis section of MD&A for additional information on the fluctuations in mortgage banking net revenue. Wealth and asset management revenue increased $31 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increases in brokerage income and personal asset management revenue.\nNoninterest expense decreased $43 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in other noninterest expense, partially offset by an increase in net occupancy and equipment expense. Other noninterest expense decreased $50 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in allocated expenses. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $10 million\nDecember 31, 2023 primarily driven by the Bancorp’s expansion into the Southeast markets.\nAverage consumer loans decreased $150 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in average residential mortgage loans, average other consumer loans and average indirect secured consumer loans, partially offset by an increase in average solar energy installation loans. Average residential mortgage loans decreased from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023 and a decrease in residential mortgage loans held for sale as the Bancorp sold government-guaranteed loans that were previously in forbearance programs. Average other consumer loans decreased from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by paydowns of loans originated in connection with one third-party point-of-sale company with which the Bancorp discontinued the origination of new loans in September 2022. Average indirect secured consumer loans decreased from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in balances in the second half of 2023, partially offset by increased loan production during 2024. Average solar energy installation loans increased from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to increased loan originations. Average commercial loans increased $625 million from the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily driven by loan originations exceeding payoffs.\nAverage deposits increased $2.4 billion from the year ended December 31, 2023 driven by increases in average money market deposits and average CDs, partially offset by decreases in average savings deposits, average interest checking deposits and average demand deposits. Average money market deposits increased $4.8 billion from the year ended December 31, 2023 p",
