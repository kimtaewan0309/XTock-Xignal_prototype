Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (herein referred to as “Northrop Grumman,” the “company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a leading global aerospace and defense technology company. We deliver a broad range of products, services and solutions to U.S. and international customers, and principally to the U.S Department of War (“DoW”, formerly referred to as the Department of Defense) and intelligence community. Our broad portfolio is aligned to support national security priorities and our solutions equip our customers with capabilities they need to connect, protect and advance humanity.\nThe company is a leading provider of space systems, military aircraft, missile defense, advanced weapons and long-range fires capabilities, mission systems, networking and communications, strategic deterrence systems, and breakthrough technologies, such as advanced computing, microelectronics and cyber. We are focused on competing and winning programs that enable continued growth, performing on our commitments and affordably delivering capability our customers need. With the investments we've made in advanced technologies, combined with our talented workforce and digital transformation capabilities, Northrop Grumman is well positioned to meet our customers' needs today and in the future.\nDivestiture of Training Services Business\nOn May 24, 2025 (the “Divestiture date”), the company completed its previously announced sale of substantially all of the Immersive Mission Solutions (IMS) operating unit of Defense Systems (the “training services” business or “divestiture”) for $333 million in cash, subject to a final working capital adjustment, and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $231 million. IMS is a provider of mission training and satellite ground network communications software for U.S. government customers. Operating results include sales and operating income for the training services business prior to the Divestiture date.\nGlobal Security Environment\nThe U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors, including in particular major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, increasing nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns and political instability. The market for defense products, services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic circumstances and priorities. Our operations and financial performance, as well as demand for our products and services, are impacted by these events, including global unrest. The same is true for our suppliers and other business partners.\nThe conflict in Ukraine and threats elsewhere, particularly in the Middle East and the Pacific region, have increased global tensions and instability and highlighted security requirements globally, including in Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific region, as well as the U.S. These conflicts have resulted in and may continue to result in increased demand for defense products and services from allies and partner nations, particularly in those regions. For example, we have experienced an increase in demand for certain of our products and services directly and indirectly related to the conflict in Ukraine. We continue to monitor developments in these regions, but have not experienced, and do not anticipate experiencing, significant adverse financial impacts directly from these conflicts.\nWe believe the current global security environment, characterized by significant national security threats to the U.S. and its allies, continues to highlight the need for strong deterrence and robust defense capabilities, and we are actively evaluating both opportunities and risks associated with this environment. We believe our capabilities, particularly in space, C4ISR, missile defense, battle management, advanced weapons, strategic deterrence, and survivable aircraft and mission systems should help our customers in the U.S. and globally defend against current and future threats and, as a result, continue to position us for long-term profitable business growth.\nGlobal Economic Environment\nOver the past several years, the global economic environment has experienced extraordinary challenges, including inflationary pressures; widespread delays and disruptions in supply chains; business slowdowns or shutdowns; workforce challenges and labor shortfalls; and market volatility. These macroeconomic factors can and have contributed, and could continue to contribute, to increased costs, delays, disruptions and other performance\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nchallenges, as well as increased competing demands for limited resources to address such increased costs and other challenges, for our company, our suppliers and partners, and our customers. We continue to work to address challenges caused by the macroeconomic environment on our business. We have seen positive progress in the supply chain as on-time deliveries and quality continue to improve. In remaining areas of pressure, we are proactively working with our suppliers to help meet our contract commitments.\nIn addition, an overall increase in interest rates in recent years has raised the cost of borrowing for governments, and if rates increase or remain elevated, it could impact government spending priorities (in the U.S. and allied countries, in particular), including the demand for defense products. Economic tensions and changes in international trade policies, including, for example, the widespread tariffs announced this year by the U.S. on its major trading partners, higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and actions taken in response (such as retaliatory tariffs or other trade protectionist measures or the renegotiation of free trade agreements), could also further impact the global market for defense products, services and solutions. The full impact of these governmental actions on macroeconomic conditions and on our business is uncertain, difficult to predict and depends on a number of factors, including the extent and duration of tariffs, any reversal or temporary suspension of announced tariffs, the availability of exemptions, changes in the amount and scope of tariffs, the imposition of new tariffs and other measures that target countries may take in response to U.S. trade policies, and possible resulting general inflationary pressures in the global economy. We are continuing to monitor the impact on our business, suppliers and customers, but do not believe that the tariffs in effect at this time will have a material adverse effect on our business.\nU.S. Political, Budget and Regulatory Environment\nThe U.S. continues to face an uncertain and evolving political, budget and regulatory environment. In particular, it is difficult to predict the specific course of future defense budgets. Current and future requirements related to the conflict in Ukraine, threats in the Middle East and the Pacific region and other security priorities, as well as the macroeconomic environment, the national debt, and other domestic priorities, among other things, in the U.S. and globally, will continue to impact our customers’ budgets, spending and priorities, and our industry. The U.S. political environment may also impact defense budgets and priorities, issues related to the national debt, and government spending more broadly. We anticipate that issues related to budgetary priorities, defense spending levels and the debt ceiling will continue to be subjects of considerable debate, with a potentially significant impact on our programs and the company.\nOn March 15, 2025, the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025 was enacted to continue funding the government through the remainder of FY 2025. The full-year continuing resolution generally maintained FY 2024 funding levels, but included an increase of $6 billion in defense spending and a decrease of $13 billion in non-defense spending compared to FY 2024 funding levels. The full-year continuing resolution provided the DoW with significant flexibility to allocate and spend funds, including authority to initiate new programs if certain requirements were met.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, the Presidential Administration (the “Administration”) submitted its budget request for FY 2026. The request includes approximately $1 trillion for national security, approximately $962 billion of which is for the DoW, with $113 billion of such DoW funds included in the reconciliation bill described below. The budget request for the DoW reflects an increase of 11.8 percent, or $101.6 billion, above FY 2025 enacted levels. Congress is evaluating the Administration’s budget request as it drafts authorization and appropriations legislation for FY 2026. On July 4, 2025, the FY 2025 reconciliation bill titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was enacted. The OBBBA allocates approximately $150 billion in funds for defense spending, including funding for air and missile defense, munitions, shipbuilding and supply chains and other military capabilities, and the appropriated funds will remain available to be obligated until September 30, 2029 and expended through FY 2034. The OBBBA is expected to result in increased investments by the DoW in defense modernization projects and Pacific region deterrence, among other programs. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information on key income tax provisions of the OBBBA.\nAppropriations for FY 2026 were not enacted by September 30, 2025, and on October 1, 2025, the U.S. Government entered a shutdown, which is ongoing. Consistent with federal guidelines, we are continuing to perform work on existing contracts funded with appropriations from prior fiscal years. In addition, we may be expected to continue to perform for some period of"
