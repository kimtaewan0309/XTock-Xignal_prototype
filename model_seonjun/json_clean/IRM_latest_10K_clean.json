BUSINESS.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nIron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (\"IMI\"), was founded in an underground facility near Hudson, New York in 1951 where it stored business records. Today, we are a global leader in information management services, and we are trusted by more than 240,000 customers in 61 countries, including approximately 95% of the Fortune 1000, to help unlock value and intelligence from their assets through services that transcend the physical and digital worlds. Our broad range of solutions address their information management, digital transformation, information security, data center and asset lifecycle management (“ALM”) needs. Our longstanding commitment to safety, security, sustainability and innovation in support of our customers underpins everything we do. We currently serve customers across an array of market verticals — commercial, legal, financial, healthcare, technology, insurance, life sciences, energy, business services, entertainment and government organizations.\nWe are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") and are a constituent of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the Morgan Stanley Capital International (\"MSCI\") REIT index and the FTSE EPRA Nareit Global Real Estate Index. As of December 31, 2024, we were number 604 on the Fortune 1000. We have been organized and have operated as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014.\nBUSINESS STRATEGY\nOVERVIEW\nOur company has been a market leader in the physical ecosystem supporting information storage and retrieval, as most businesses have relied on paper documents or computer tapes to store their valuable information. Over time, customers are increasing their digital information, with the new information storage ecosystem being a hybrid of physical and digital media. We have evolved our business to meet our customers' needs while remaining focused on driving growth supported by our four pillars outlined below.\nContinued revenue growth in physical storage through revenue management actions as well as volume growth achieved in faster growing markets and our consumer business, as well as complementary business growth\nWe are establishing and enhancing leadership positions in higher-growth markets such as central and eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\nWe continue to identify, acquire, incubate and scale complementary businesses and products to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. These opportunities include our Global Digital Solutions, ALM, Fine Arts and Consumer Storage (each as defined below) businesses.\nUtilizing our global scale as well as over 70 years of customer trust to deliver differentiated data center offerings\nWe have made significant progress in scaling our Global Data Center Business through acquisitions and organic growth, with 29 operating data centers across 21 global markets, either directly or through unconsolidated joint ventures.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had leased approximately 96% of the existing 416 megawatt (\"MW\") capacity of our data centers. With a total potential capacity of 1,280 MW in land and buildings currently owned or operated by us, we are among the largest global data center operators.\nEstablishing and maintaining a leadership position in critical digital infrastructure as well as developing and offering new products and services that allow our customers to achieve reliable and secure information management solutions in an increasingly hybrid physical and digital world\nWe are positioned to take advantage of the secular growth trends of the changing nature of digital infrastructure. We continue to scale our Global Digital Solutions business to complement our existing offerings in records and information management, ALM, and our Global Data Center business in order to respond to our customers’ growing interest and need to react to environmental, social and corporate governance considerations. This full suite of complementary businesses puts Iron Mountain in a unique position to cross sell our products and services to our customers.\nOur customers are faced with navigating a more complex regulatory environment, and one in which hybrid physical and digital solutions have become the norm. Our strategy is underpinned by our persistent focus on best-in-class customer experience, as we continue to seek innovative solutions to help our customers progress on their journey from physical storage to a digital ecosystem.\nContinued investment in our growth agenda, our business and customer-centric solutions\nWe have established an investment strategy to fuel our growth. The investments we outlined in our plan for Project Matterhorn (as defined below) have been informed by our established leadership position in the physical storage business, our expanding services such as Global Digital Solutions and ALM and our significant progress in the Global Data Center Business.\nPROJECT MATTERHORN\nIn September 2022, we announced a global program designed to accelerate the growth of our business (\"Project Matterhorn\"). Project Matterhorn investments focus on transforming our operating model to a global operating model. Project Matterhorn focuses on the formation of a solution-based sales approach that is designed to allow us to optimize our shared services and best practices to better serve our customers' needs. We are investing to accelerate growth and to capture a greater share of the large, global addressable markets in which we operate. We have incurred approximately $378.5 million in Restructuring and other transformation costs from the inception of Project Matterhorn through December 31, 2024. We expect to incur approximately $150.0 million in costs related to Project Matterhorn during the year ending December 31, 2025, at which point the program is expected to be completed. Costs are comprised of (1) restructuring costs, which include (i) site consolidation and other related exit costs, (ii) employee severance costs and (iii) certain professional fees associated with these activities, and (2) other transformation costs, which include professional fees such as project management costs and costs for third party consultants who are assisting in the enablement of our growth initiatives. Total costs related to Project Matterhorn during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $161.4 million and $175.2 million, respectively.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe amount of revenues derived from our business segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, are set forth in Note 11 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nGLOBAL RIM BUSINESS\nThe Global Records and Information Management (\"Global RIM\") Business segment includes several distinct offerings.\nstores physical records and provides information services, vital records services, courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents (\"Records Management\") for customers in 61 countries around the globe.\nprovides storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations, server and computer backup services and related services offerings (\"Data Management\").\nGlobal Digital Solutions,\ndevelops, implements and supports comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers’ information, including the management of physical records, conversion of documents to digital formats and digital storage of information (\"Global Digital Solutions\").

Our mission-critical storage offerings and related services generated approximately $6.1 billion in annual revenue in 2024. Our business has a highly diverse customer base of more than 240,000 customers - with no single customer accounting for more than approximately 1% of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 - and operates in 61 countries globally. This presents a significant cross-sell opportunity for our expanding solutions, including digital, data center and ALM.\nA majority of our revenue is recurring in nature. In our Records Management business, our contracted storage rental fee agreements generally range from one to five years in length. As of December 31, 2024, we stored more than 730 million cubic feet of physical volume and we have consistently experienced strong customer retention levels. In our Global Data Center Business, our lease durations vary by customer, with a weighted average lease expiration of 10.6 years as of December 31, 2024.\nComprehensive Information\nAs an S&P 500 REIT with approximately 1,350 locations globally and with offerings spanning physical storage, digitization solutions and digital storage, we are positioned to provide a hol",

Our structural tax rate for purposes of the calculation of Adjusted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 15.6% and 12.3%, respectively.\nColumns may not foot due to rounding.\nFFO (NAREIT) AND FFO (NORMALIZED)\nFunds from operations (\"FFO\") is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts as net income (loss) excluding depreciation on real estate assets, losses and gains on sale of real estate, net of tax, and amortization of data center leased-based intangibles (\"FFO (Nareit)\"). We calculate our FFO measures, including FFO (Nareit), adjusting for our share of reconciling items from our unconsolidated joint ventures. FFO (Nareit) does not give effect to real estate depreciation because these amounts are computed, under GAAP, to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Because values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, we believe that FFO (Nareit) provides investors with a clearer view of our operating performance. Our most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO (Nareit) is net income (loss).\nWe modify FFO (Nareit), as is common among REITs seeking to provide financial measures that most meaningfully reflect their particular business (\"FFO (Normalized)\"). Our definition of FFO (Normalized) excludes certain items included in FFO (Nareit) that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically:\nEXCLUDED\nAcquisition and Integration Costs\nRestructuring and other transformation\nLoss (gain) on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net (excluding real estate)\nOther expense (income), net\nStock-based compensation expense\nNon-cash amortization related to derivative instruments\nReal estate financing lease depreciation\nTax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items\nIntangible impairments\n(Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS) TO FFO (NAREIT) AND FFO (NORMALIZED) (IN THOUSANDS):\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\nReal estate depreciation\n(Gain) loss on sale of real estate, net of tax\nData center lease-based intangible assets amortization\nOur share of FFO (Nareit) reconciling items from our unconsolidated joint ventures\nAcquisition and Integration Costs\nRestructuring and other transformation\nLoss (gain) on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net (excluding real estate)\nOther expense (income), net, excluding our share of losses (gains) from our unconsolidated joint ventures\nStock-based compensation expense\nNon-cash amortization related to derivative instruments\nReal estate financing lease depreciation\nTax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items\nOur share of FFO (Normalized) reconciling items from our unconsolidated joint ventures\nIncludes depreciation expense related to owned real estate assets (land improvements, buildings, building and leasehold improvements, data center infrastructure and racking structures), excluding depreciation related to real estate financing leases.\nTax expense associated with the gain on sale of real estate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $1.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\nIncludes amortization expense for Data Center In-Place Leases and Data Center Tenant Relationships as defined in Note 2.m. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nRepresents the tax impact of (i) the reconciling items above, which impact our reported net income (loss) before provision (benefit) for income taxes but has an insignificant impact on our reported provision (benefit) for income taxes and (ii) other discrete tax items. Discrete tax items resulted in a (benefit) provision for income taxes of $(6.2) million and $(18.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following should be read in conjunction with Note 2 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, which provides a summary of our significant accounting policies. Our critical accounting estimates include the following, which are listed in no particular order:\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenue is recognized when or as control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 2.s. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional details on our revenue recognition policies. Revenue for all our lines of business, with the exception of storage revenues in our Global Data Center Business (which is subject to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 842,\n), is recognized in accordance with ASC 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n(\"ASC 606\"), the application of which requires that we make significant judgments related to performance obligations and the transfer of control to the customer.\nWe have determined that the majority of our contracts contain series performance obligations which qualify to be recognized under a practical expedient available in ASC 606 known as the \"right to invoice\". This determination allows variable consideration in such contracts to be allocated to and recognized in the period to which the consideration relates, which is typically the period in which it is billed, rather than requiring estimation of variable consideration at the inception of the contract.\nCertain costs to fulfill or obtain customer contracts and certain initial direct costs of obtaining data center leases, including the costs associated with the initial movement of customer records into physical storage and certain commission expenses, are collectively referred to as \"Contract Costs\". Contract Costs are capitalized and amortized as a component of depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, generally over a three year term, which we have determined is consistent with the transfer of the underlying performance obligations to which the assets relate. Different determinations on term length would result in differences in the amount and timing of amortization expense recognized.\nACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS\nPart of our growth strategy has been to acquire businesses. The purchase price of each acquisition is determined after due diligence of the target business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.\nAccounting for acquisitions of a business has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimate the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of intangible assets (primarily customer and supplier relationship and data center lease-based intangible assets), property, plant and equipment (primarily buildings, building and leasehold improvements, data center infrastructure and racking structures), operating leases, contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes). See Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a description of recent acquisitions.\nDetermining the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates and market data, among other items. As it relates to our data center acquisitions, the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to (i) certain economic costs (as described more fully in Note 2.m. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report) avoided by acquiring a data center operation with active tenants that would have otherwise been incurred if the data center operation was purchased vacant, (ii) market rental rates and (iii) expectations of lease renewals and extensions. Due to the inherent uncertainty of future events, actual values of net assets acquired could be different from our estimated fair values and could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOf the net assets acquired in our acquisitions, the fair value of owned buildings, including data center infrastructure and building improvements, customer and supplier relationship and data center lease-based intangible assets, racking structures and operating leases are generally the most common and most significant. For significant acquisitions or acquisitions involving new markets or new products, we generally use third parties to assist us in estimating the fair value of owned buildings, including data center infrastructure and building improvements, customer and supplier relationship and lease-based intangible assets and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. For acquisitions that are not significant or do not involve new markets or new products, we generally use third parties to assist us in estimating the fair value of owned buildings, including data center infrastructure and building improvements, and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. When not using third party appraisals of the fair value of acquired net assets, the fair value of acquired customer and supplier relationship intangible assets, above and below market in-place operating leases, and racking structures is determined internally. When estimating fair values internally, we use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of customer and supplier relationship intangible assets, which requires a significant amount of judgment by management, including estimating expected lives of the relationships, expected future cash flows and discount rates. The fair value of above and below market in-place operating leases is determined internally using a discounted cash flow model, utilizing the difference in cash flows between the contractual lease payments over the remaining lease term and estimated market rental rates on comparable assets at the time of the acquisition. The fair value of acquired racking structures is determined internally by taking current estimated replacement cost at the date of acquisition for the quantity of racking structures acquired, discounted to take into account the quality (e.g. age, material and type) of the racking structures. We determine the fair value of tangible data center assets using an estimated replacement cost at the date of acquisition, then discounting for age, economic and functional obsolescence.\nThe fair value of the deferred purchase obligation associated with the ITRenew Transaction (as defined in Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report) was determined utilizing a Monte-Carlo simulation model and takes into account our forecasted projections as it relates to the underlying performance of the business. The Monte-Carlo simulation model incorporates assumptions as to expected gross profits over the applicable achievement period, including adjustments for the volatility of timing and amount of the associated revenue and costs, as well as discount rates that account for the risk of the underlying arrangement and overall market risks.\nThe fair value of the deferred purchase obligation associated with the Regency Transaction (as defined in Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report) was determined utilizing a Monte-Carlo simulation model and takes into account our forecasted projections as it relates to the underlying performance of the business. The Monte-Carlo simulation model incorporates assumptions as to expected revenue over the achievement period, including adjustments for volatility and timing, as well as discount rates that account for the risk of the arrangement and overall market risks.\nOur estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy of such assumptions. Total supplier relationship intangible assets acquired in our 2024 acquisitions was approximately $131.5 million.\nIMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nASSETS SUBJECT TO DEPRECIATION OR AMORTIZATION\nWe review long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include, but are not limited to:\nA significant decrease in the market price of an asset;\nA significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;\nA significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset;\nAn accumulation of costs significantly greater than the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;\nA current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; and\nA current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nIf events indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the sum of the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operat",
