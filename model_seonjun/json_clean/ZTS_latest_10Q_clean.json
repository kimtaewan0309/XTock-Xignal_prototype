We regularly monitor our accounts receivable for collectability, particularly in markets where economic conditions remain uncertain. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. Our assessment is based on such factors as past due aging, historical and expected collection patterns, the financial condition of our customers, the robust nature of our credit and collection practices and the economic environment.\nFor additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the\nAnalysis of the condensed consolidated balance sheets\nAnalysis of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows\nsections of this MD&A.\nCredit facility and other lines of credit\nIn August 2025, we entered into a new and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a multi-year $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility), which expires in December 2027. The credit facility replaced our previous revolving credit facility. Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to $1.75 billion. The credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for such period) of 3.50:1. Upon entering into a material acquisition, the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4.00:1, and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition. In addition, the credit facility contains other customary covenants.\nWe were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. There were no amounts drawn under the credit facility as of September 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024.\nWe have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding short-term borrowings. As of September 30, 2025, we had access to $60 million of lines of credit which expire at various times and are generally renewed annually. There were no borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of September 30, 2025 and the previous revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2024.\nDomestic and international short-term funds\nMany of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. The amount of funds held in the U.S. will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business development activities. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of U.S. and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). Actual repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional U.S. and local income taxes, such as U.S. state income taxes, local withholding taxes, and taxes on currency gains and losses.\nGlobal economic conditions\nGlobal financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic, business and financial volatility. Challenging economic conditions in recent years have not had, nor do we anticipate that it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. Due to our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. There can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nOur senior notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indentures (collectively, the indenture) between us and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee. The indenture contains certain covenants, including limitations on our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens or engage in sale lease-back transactions. The indenture also contains restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets. In addition, the indenture contains other customary terms, including certain events of default, upon the occurrence of which, the senior notes may be declared immediately due and payable.\nPursuant to the indenture, we are able to redeem the senior notes of any series, in whole or in part, at any time by paying a “make whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade of the senior notes below an investment grade rating by each of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, we are, in certain circumstances, required to make an offer to repurchase all of the outstanding senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase.\nOur outstanding debt securities are as follows:\n2017 Senior Notes due 2027\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on September 12, 2027\n2018 Senior Notes due 2028\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on August 20, 2028\n2025 Senior Notes due 2028\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on August 17, 2028\n2020 Senior Notes due 2030\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on May 15, 2030\n2022 Senior Notes due 2032\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on November 16, 2032\n2025 Senior Notes due 2035\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on August 17, 2035\n2013 Senior Notes due 2043\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on February 1, 2043\n2017 Senior Notes due 2047\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on September 12, 2047\n2018 Senior Notes due 2048\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on August 20, 2048\n2020 Senior Notes due 2050\nInterest due semi annually, not subject to amortization, aggregate principal due on May 15, 2050\nTwo major corporate debt-rating organizations, Moody’s and S&P, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nThe following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced long-term debt:\nName of Rating Agency\nP-2\nA3\nS&P\nA-2\nBBB+\nShare repurchase program\nIn August 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a multi-year share repurchase program of up to $6 billion of our outstanding common stock. As of September 30, 2025, there was $4.5 billion remaining under this authorization. Purchases of Zoetis shares may be made at the discretion of management, depending on market conditions and business needs. Share repurchases may be executed through various means, including open market or privately negotiated transactions. During the first nine months of 2025, 7.3 million shares were repurchased for $1,158 million, which excludes a $11 million accrual for excise tax on net share repurchases.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we may indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. These indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not material.\nNew accounting standards\nNote 3.
