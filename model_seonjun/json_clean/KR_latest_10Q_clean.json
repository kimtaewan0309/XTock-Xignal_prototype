Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nVarious uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These include:\nThe extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates. Our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit, including our bank credit facilities, could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us, or in the event that global pandemics, natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us. Our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets.\nOur ability to achieve sales, earnings and incremental FIFO operating profit goals may be affected by: labor negotiations; potential work stoppages; changes in the unemployment rate; pressures in the labor market; changes in government-funded benefit programs; changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us; pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors, and the aggressiveness of that competition; our response to these actions; the state of the economy, including interest rates, the inflationary, disinflationary and/or deflationary trends and such trends in certain commodities, products and/or operating costs; the geopolitical environment including wars and conflicts; unstable political situations and social unrest; changes in tariffs; the effect that fuel costs have on consumer spending; volatility of fuel margins; manufacturing commodity costs; supply constraints; diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations; trends in consumer spending; the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions; the uncertainty of economic growth or recession; stock repurchases; changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate, along with changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies; our ability to retain pharmacy sales from third-party payors; consolidation in the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit managers; our ability to negotiate modifications to multi-employer pension plans; natural disasters or adverse weather conditions; the effect of public health crises or other significant catastrophic events; the potential costs and risks associated with potential cyber-attacks or data security breaches; the success of our future growth plans; the ability to execute our growth strategy and value creation model, including continued cost savings, growth of our alternative profit businesses, and our ability to better serve our customers and to generate customer loyalty and sustainable growth through our strategic pillars of Fresh,\n, personalization, and eCommerce; the outcome of litigation matters, including those relating to the terminated transaction with Albertsons; and the risks relating to or arising from our opioid litigation settlements, including the risk of litigation relating to persons, entities, or jurisdictions that do not participate in those settlements.\nOur ability to achieve these goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above. Our ability to execute our financial strategy may be affected by our ability to generate cash flow.\n\nFIFO operating profit was $925 million, or 2.73% of sales, for the second quarter of 2025, compared to $836 million, or 2.47% of sales, for the second quarter of 2024. FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales, excluding the 2025 and 2024 Second Quarter Adjusted Items, increased 32 basis points in the second quarter of 2025, compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to a higher FIFO gross margin rate, partially offset by increased OG&A and depreciation and amortization expenses, as a percentage of sales.\nFIFO operating profit was $2.3 billion, or 2.89% of sales, for the first two quarters of 2025, compared to $2.2 billion, or 2.74% of sales, for the first two quarters of 2024. FIFO operating profit, as a percentage of sales, excluding the 2025 and 2024 Adjusted Items, increased 15 basis points in the first two quarters of 2025, compared to the first two quarters of 2024, primarily due to a higher FIFO gross margin rate, partially offset by increased OG&A and depreciation and amortization expenses, as a percentage of sales.\nSpecific factors contributing to the trends driving operating profit and FIFO operating profit identified above are discussed earlier in this section.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of operating profit to FIFO operating profit, and to Adjusted FIFO operating profit, excluding the 2025 and 2024 Adjusted Items:\nOperating Profit excluding the Adjusted Items\nSecond Quarter Ended\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nKroger delivered another quarter of strong results, which demonstrates the clear and measurable progress we’ve made on our priorities – to simplify our organization, to improve the customer experience and to focus on work that creates the most value. Sales growth has been strong, led by pharmacy, eCommerce and Fresh, and we are encouraged by the improvement in grocery volumes. We are executing better in our stores and we are more focused on our core business and our core customer. We are moving with speed and we are simplifying the company.\nWe continue to believe that our strategy focusing on Fresh,\nand eCommerce will continue to resonate with customers and our resilient model positions us well to navigate the current environment. We are focused on investments that will grow our core business and maximize return on invested capital over time, while remaining committed to maintaining our current investment grade rating, growing our dividend, subject to board approval, and returning excess capital to shareholders. We are confident that by executing on these key priorities, we will generate long-term growth and attractive shareholder returns.\nThe following table provides highlights of our financial performance:\nFinancial Performance Data\n($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nSecond Quarter Ended\n\nOVERVIEW\nNotable items for the second quarter and first two quarters of 2025 are:\nNet earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share of $0.91 for the second quarter and $2.20 for the first two quarters of 2025.\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to The Kroger Co. per diluted common share of $1.04 for the second quarter and $2.53 for the first two quarters of 2025. This represents a 12% increase for the second quarter of 2025 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and a 7% increase for the first two quarters of 2025 compared to the first two quarters of 2024.\nAchieved operating profit of $863 million for the second quarter and $2.2 billion for the first two quarters of 2025.\nAchieved adjusted FIFO operating profit of $1.1 billion for the second quarter and $2.6 billion for the first two quarters of 2025. This represents an 11% increase for the second quarter of 2025 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and a 5% increase for the first two quarters of 2025 compared to the first two quarters of 2024.\nGenerated cash flows from operations of $3.7 billion for the first two quarters of 2025, which represents a 6% increase compared to the first two quarters of 2024.\nCash and temporary cash investments increased by $924 million from $4.0 billion as of fiscal year end 2024 to $4.9 billion as of August 16, 2025.\nReturned $625 million to shareholders from share repurchases and dividend payments in the first two quarters of 2025.\nOther Financial Results\nIdentical sales, excluding fuel and Adjusted Items, increased 3.4% in the second quarter and 3.3% in the first two quarters of 2025. Our sales growth was led by strong pharmacy, eCommerce and Fresh sales.\neCommerce sales increased 16% in the second quarter and 15% in the first two quarters of 2025, compared to the same periods of 2024. eCommerce sales include products ordered online and picked up at our stores and our Delivery and Ship solutions. Our Delivery solutions include orders delivered to customers from retail store locations, customer fulfillment centers and orders placed through third-party platforms. Our Ship solutions primarily include online orders placed through our owned platforms that are dispatched using mail service or third-party courier. eCommerce sales growth was led by strong demand for our Delivery solutions.\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, we recognized store closure costs of $100 million, $77 million net of tax, related to the planned closing of approximately 60 stores over the next 18 months. As a result of these store closures, we expect a modest financial benefit and we are committed to reinvesting these savings back into the customer experience. We will offer roles in other stores to all associates currently employed at the affected stores.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, in addition to the recurring multi-employer pension contributions we make in the normal course of business, we contributed an incremental $60 million, $46 million net of tax, to multi-employer pension plans, helping stabilize future associate benefits and allowing us to pre-fund future requirements. Total multi-employer pension contributions drove a 16 basis point increase in our operating, general and administrative expenses (“OG&A”) rate in the first two quarters of 2025, compared to the first two quarters of 2024 (the “2025 Multi-Employer Pension Contributions”).\nDuring the second quarter of 2025, we approved and implemented a plan to reduce our corporate administrative team by nearly"
