The nine months ended September 30, 2025, included transaction costs related primarily to the EnLink Acquisition of $59 million included within other and $15 million included within noncash compensation expense and other.\n(b) - The three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, included corporate net gains on extinguishment of debt of $22 million and $58 million, respectively, in connection with open market repurchases.\nCONTINGENCIES\nSee Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of regulatory and legal matters.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n- Our primary sources of cash inflows are operating cash flows, proceeds from our commercial paper program and our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, debt issuances and the issuance of common stock for our liquidity and capital resource requirements.\nWe expect our sources of cash inflows to provide sufficient resources to finance our operations, capital expenditures, quarterly cash dividends, maturities of long-term debt, share repurchases and contributions to unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures. We believe we have sufficient liquidity due to our $3.5 Billion Credit Agreement, which expires in February 2030, and access to $1.0 billion available through our “at-the-market” equity program. As of October 20, 2025, no shares have been sold through our “at-the-market” equity program.\nWe may manage interest-rate risk through the use of fixed-rate debt, floating-rate debt, Treasury locks and interest-rate swaps.\n\nOperating Cash Flows\n- Operating cash flows are affected by earnings from our business activities and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in commodity prices and demand for our services or products, whether because of general economic conditions, changes in supply, changes in demand for the end products that are made with our products or increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings and operating cash flows. Our operating cash flows can also be impacted by changes in our inventory balances, which are driven primarily by commodity prices, supply, demand and the operation of our assets.\nCash flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased $890 million compared with the same period in 2024, due primarily to the impact of the EnLink and Medallion Acquisitions as discussed in “Financial Results and Operating Information.”\nThe changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows $347 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared with a decrease of $233 million for the same period in 2024. This change is due primarily to changes in accounts receivable resulting from the receipt of cash from counterparties and from inventory, both of which vary from period to period, and with changes in commodity prices. These changes were partially offset by changes in accounts payable, which vary from period to period with changes in commodity prices and from the timing of payments to vendors, suppliers and other third parties.\nInvesting Cash Flows\n- Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased $810 million, compared with the same period in 2024, due primarily to an increase in capital expenditures related to our capital projects in 2025, cash paid for the BridgeTex Additional Interest Acquisition and proceeds received from the divestiture of certain non-strategic assets in 2024, offset partially by cash paid for acquisitions in 2024.\nFinancing Cash Flows\n- Cash from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, decreased $5.6 billion, compared with the same period in 2024, due primarily to the issuance of senior unsecured notes associated with acquisitions in 2024, increased repayments of long-term debt in 2025, cash paid for the Delaware Basin JV Acquisition and increased dividends paid in 2025, offset partially by the issuance of senior unsecured notes in August 2025.\nIMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for discussion of new accounting standards.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates.\nInformation about our critical accounting estimates is included under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates,” in our Annual Report.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Exchange Act, which involve substantial risk and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our anticipated financial performance, liquidity, management’s plans, expectations and objectives for our future capital projects and other future operations, our business prospects, the outcome of regulatory and legal proceedings, market conditions, potential or pending strategic transactions, the timing thereof and our ability to achieve the intended and projected operational, financial and strategic benefits from any such transactions, and other matters. The following discussion is intended to identify important factors that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements and other statements in this Quarterly Report regarding our environmental, social and other sustainability targets, plans and goals are not an indication that these statements are required to be disclosed in our filings with the SEC, or that we will continue to make similar statements in the same extent or manner in future filings. In addition, historical, current and forward-looking environmental, social and sustainability-related statements may be based on standards and processes for measuring progress that are still developing and that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future.\nForward-looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraphs, the information concerning possible or assumed future results of our operations and other statements contained in this Quarterly Report identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “continues,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “outlook,” “plans,” “potential,” “projects,” “scheduled,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” and other words and terms of similar meaning.\nOne should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Those factors may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with the forward-looking statements, factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statement include, among others, the following:\nthe impact on drilling and production by factors beyond our control, including the demand for natural gas, NGLs, Refined Products and crude oil; producers’ desire and ability to drill and obtain necessary permits; regulatory compliance; reserve performance; and capacity constraints and/or shut downs on the pipelines that transport crude oil, natural gas, NGLs, and Refined Products from producing areas and our facilities;\nthe impact of unfavorable economic and market conditions, inflationary pressures, which may increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, raise the cost of capital or depress economic growth;\nthe impact of the volatility of natural gas, NGL, Refined Products and crude oil prices on our earnings and cash flows, which is impacted by a variety of factors beyond our control, including international terrorism and conflicts and geopolitical instability;\nthe impact of reduced volatility in energy prices or new government regulations that could discourage our storage customers from holding positions in Refined Products, crude oil and natural gas;\nthe economic or other impact of announced or future tariffs, including inflationary impacts;\nthe economic or other impact of the current federal government shutdown;\nour dependence on producers, gathering systems, refineries and pipelines owned and operated by others and the impact of any closures, interruptions or reduced activity levels at these facilities;\nthe impact of increased attention to ESG issues, including climate change, and risks associated with the physical and financial impacts of climate change;\nrisks associated with operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions at our operations;\nthe inability of insurance proceeds to cover all liabilities or incurred costs and losses, or lost earnings, resulting from "
