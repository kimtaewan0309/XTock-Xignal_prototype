Factors affected by the economy include our transaction volumes, the credit risk of our customers and changes in tax laws across the globe. These factors affected our businesses in each of our segments.\nForeign currency changes\n—Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates; namely, by movements of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Brit\nish pound, Canadian dollar, Czech koruna, euro, Mexican peso, and New Zealand dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar. Approximately 50% and 52% of o\nrevenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, was derived in U.S. dollars and was not affected by foreign currency exchange rates. See \"Results of Operations\" for information related to foreign currency impact on our total revenue, net.\nOur cross-border foreign risk management business aggregates foreign currency exposures arising from customer contracts and economically hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. These contracts are subject to counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk from collateral calls.\nWe further manage the impact of economic changes in the value of certain foreign-denominated net assets by utilizing cross currency interest rate swaps. See \"Liquidity and capital resources\" below for information regarding our cross currency interest rate swaps.\nFuel price volatility\n—Our Vehicle Payments customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel.

We estimate approximately 8% of revenues, net were directly impacted by ch\nanges in fuel price in both the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. See \"Results of Operations\" for information related to the fuel price impact on our total revenues, net.\nFuel-price spread volatility\n—A\nortion of our revenue involves transactions where we derive revenue from fuel price spreads, which is the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant for the same transaction. In these transactions, the price paid to the merchant is based on the wholesale cost of fuel.
