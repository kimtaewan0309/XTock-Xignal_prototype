  "item7_clean": "The passage of time provides additional information which may result in revisions to previous estimates to reflect updated information. In the past five years, annual revisions other than price to our proved reserve estimates, which have been both increases and decreases in individual years, have averaged approximately 3% of the previous year’s estimate. However, there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future. For example, revisions may be driven broadly by economic factors such as significant changes in operating costs, or they may be more focused such as in a given area or reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.\n\nTo assess the performance of our assets, we use EBITDAX and Field-Level Cash Margin. We compute EBITDAX as net earnings before income tax expense; financing costs, net; exploration expenses; DD&A; asset impairments; asset disposition gains and losses; non-cash share-based compensation; non-cash valuation changes for derivatives and financial instruments; accretion on discounted liabilities; and other items not related to our normal operations. Field-Level Cash Margin is computed as oil, gas and NGL revenues less production expenses. Production expenses consist of lease operating, gathering, processing and transportation expenses, as well as production and property taxes.\n\nEstimated fair values ascribed to assets acquired can have a significant impact on future results of operations presented in our financial statements. A higher fair value ascribed to a property results in higher DD&A expense, which results in lower net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserve quantities, development costs and operating costs. In the event that future commodity prices or reserve quantities are lower than those used as inputs to determine estimates of acquisition date fair values, the likelihood increases that certain costs may be determined to not be recoverable.\n\nManagement evaluates assets for impairment through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews include future production volumes associated with proved producing and risk-adjusted proved undeveloped reserves, and when needed, probable and possible reserves.\n\nOur net earnings and operating cash flow are highly dependent upon oil, gas and NGL prices which can be incredibly volatile due to several varying factors. Commodity prices were strong during 2022 as the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic increased demand for oil and gas commodities, while economic sanctions imposed on Russia and restraint from OPEC+ on production growth both simultaneously impacted the supply of these commodities. In 2023, commodity prices weakened primarily due to economic uncertainty surrounding inflation and increased interest rates as well as certain geopolitical events. During 2024, oil and NGL prices remained stable from the prior year while gas prices decreased primarily due to warmer weather impacts and excess\n\n– Commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses. Significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities. As a result, the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and materials may also decrease, causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline. However, the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices. We expect to mitigate the impact of cost inflation through efficiencies gained from the scale of our operations as well as by leveraging our long-standing relationships with our suppliers.\n\nSimilar to the evaluation of suspended exploratory well costs, costs for undeveloped leasehold, for which reserves have not been proven, must also be evaluated for continued capitalization or impairment. At the end of each quarter, management assesses undeveloped leasehold costs for impairment by considering future drilling plans, drilling activity results, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. At December 31, 2024, Devon had approximately $1.9 billion of undeveloped leasehold costs. Of the remaining undeveloped leasehold costs at December 31, 2024, none is scheduled to expire in 2025.\n\nWe utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities which requires management’s assessment of the proper designation of wells and associated costs as developmental or exploratory. This classification assessment is dependent on the determination and existence of proved reserves, which is a critical estimate discussed in the section below. The classification of developmental and exploratory costs has a direct impact on the amount of costs we initially recognize as exploration expense or capitalize, then subject to DD&A calculations and impairment assessments and valuations.\n\nOnce a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. Development wells are always capitalized. Costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs to determine whether the costs should continue to remain capitalized or shall be expensed. When making this determination, management considers current activities,\n\nWe exclude financing costs from EBITDAX to assess our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. Exploration expenses and asset disposition gains and losses are excluded from EBITDAX because they generally are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. DD&A and impairments are excluded from EBITDAX because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. We exclude share-based compensation, valuation changes, accretion on discounted liabilities and other items from EBITDAX because they are not considered a measure of asset operating performance.\n\nnear-term plans for additional exploratory or appraisal drilling and the likelihood of reaching a development program. If management determines future development activities and the determination of proved reserves are unlikely to occur, the associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings. Otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. At December 31, 2024, all material suspended well costs have been suspended for less than one year.\n\nLong-lived assets used in operations, including proved and unproved oil and gas properties, are depreciated and assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group. For DD&A calculations and impairment assessments, management groups individual assets based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level (“common operating field”) for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The determination of common operating fields is largely based on geological structural features or stratigraphic condition, which requires judgment. Management also considers the nature of production, common infrastructure, common sales points, common processing plants, common regulation and management oversight to make common operating field determinations. These determinations impact the amount of DD&A recognized each period and could impact the determination and measurement of a potential asset impairment.\n\nThe table below presents the field-level cash margin for each of our operating areas. Field-level cash margin is computed as oil, gas and NGL revenues less production expenses and is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures is found in “Non-GAAP Measures” in this Item 7. The changes in production volumes, realized prices and production expenses, shown above, had the following impacts on our field-level cash margins by asset.\n\nIn 2024, WTI oil prices averaged $75.79 per Bbl versus $77.62 per Bbl in 2023, reflecting a downward trend as oil prices remained volatile even with continued capital discipline by global oil producers. Oil is expected to remain volatile in 2025 due to geopolitical risks to supply, forecasted stronger non-OPEC supply, and improving global demand growth expectations. Henry Hub natural gas prices fell in 2024, averaging $2.27 per Mcf compared to $2.74 per Mcf in 2023. For 2025, natural gas prices are expected to increase compared with 2024 prices due to increased demand, driven by rising LNG exports, strong powerburn as well as discipline from natural gas producers. Our 2025 cash flow is partly protected from commodity price volatility due to our current hedge position that covers approximately 30% of our anticipated oil and gas volumes. In order to further insulate our cash flow, we continue to examine and, when appropriate, execute attractive regional basis swap hedges to protect price realizations across our portfolio.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we issued $3.25 billion of debt to partially fund the Grayson Mill acquisition. Additionally, we retired $472 million of debt in the third quarter of 2024. The net impact of this debt activity is expected to increase our annual net financing costs by approximately $180 million. For additional information, see\nin \"Part I. Financial Information - Item 1. Financial Statements\" in this report.\n\nThe following discussion and analyses primarily focus on 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this report can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our\n\nWe make reference to “core earnings attributable to Devon” and “core earnings per share attributable to Devon” in “Overview of 2024 Results” in this Item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not alternatives to GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under GAAP. Core earnings attributable to Devon, as well as the per share amount, represent net earnings excluding certain noncash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our quarterly financial results. Our non-GAAP measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure. Amounts excluded for 2024 relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments (including unproved asset impairments), fair value changes in derivative financial instruments and restructuring and transaction costs.\n\nG&A increased in 2024 primarily due to higher employee compensation, driven in part by inflationary adjustments and the Grayson Mill acquisition. We also had an increase in non-labor costs which were primarily related to technology system upgrade projects.\n\nWe made a number of assumptions in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values of proved and unproved oil and gas properties. Since sufficient market data was not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, we prepared estimates and engaged third-party valuation experts. Significant judgments and assumptions are inherent in these estimates and include, among other things, estimates of reserve quantities, estimates of future commodity prices, drilling plans, expected development costs, lease operating costs, reserve risk adjustment factors and an estimate of an applicable market participant discount rate that reflects the risk of the underlying cash flow estimates.\n\nOur commitment to capital discipline and capital efficiency remains unchanged with our 2025 capital program. Similar to 2024, the majority of our 2025 capital, or approximately 55%, is expected to be focused on our highest returning oil play, the Delaware Basin. Our Williston Basin assets will receive additional capital allocation through 2025 as we work to develop the newly acquired Grayson Mill assets. The remainder of our 2025 capital will continue to be deployed to our other core areas of Eagle Ford, Anadarko Basin and Powder River Basin. Our 2025 capital is expected to be approximately 7% higher than 2024 primarily due to increased activity in the Williston Basin. Due to our strategy of spending within cash flow, we expect to continue generating material amounts of free cash flow for 2025.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. We consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\n\nFurther, in the event we were to undergo an “ownership change” (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), our ability to use net operating losses and tax credits generated prior to the ownership change may be limited. Generally, an “ownership change” occurs if one or more shareholders, each of whom owns five percent or more in value of a corporation’s stock, increase their aggregate percentage ownership by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage of stock owned by those shareholders at any time during the preceding three-year period. Based on currently available information, we do not believe an ownership change has occurred during 2024 for Devon.\n\nManagement’s Discussion and Analy\nsis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nWe also estimate and escalate or de-escalate future capital and operating costs by using a method that correlates cost movements to price movements similar to recent history. To measure indicated impairments, we use a market-based weighte",
