MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIngersoll Rand is a global market leader with a broad flow creation and industrial product portfolio across air, gas, powder, and liquid handling applications, providing services and solutions to increase industrial and life science productivity, efficiency, and sustainability. We manufacture one of the broadest and most complete ranges of compressor, pump, vacuum and blower products in our markets, which, when combined with our global geographic footprint and application expertise, allows us to provide differentiated product and service offerings to our customers. Our products are sold under a collection of premier, market-leading brands, including Ingersoll Rand, Gardner Denver, Nash, CompAir, ILC Dover, Thomas, Milton Roy, Seepex, Elmo Rietschle, ARO, Robuschi, Emco Wheaton and Runtech Systems, which we believe are globally recognized in their respective end-markets and known for product quality, reliability, efficiency and superior customer service.\nWe operate with two reportable segments: Industrial Technologies and Services and Precision and Science Technologies. See Note 19 “\nItems Affecting our Business, Industry and End Markets\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nOur financial results closely follow changes in the industries and end-markets we serve. Demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures depends, in turn, on the general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost, which can vary significantly based on geography and customer segmentation.\nTo date, 2025 has been marked by continued uncertainty in global markets, driven by investor concerns over inflation, elevated interest rates, ongoing political and regulatory uncertainty, including potential shifts in U.S. trade policy and the imposition of new tariffs, as well as geopolitical instability stemming from the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.\nFurther contributing to economic uncertainty, the current U.S. presidential administration has signaled its intention to implement significant changes to U.S. trade policy, the size of the federal government and the enforcement of various regulations. These policy shifts could introduce additional market instability and reduce investor confidence. For example, the U.S. government recently announced tariffs on goods imported from various countries to the United States. Countries subject to such tariffs have imposed, or may in the future, impose reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs and other trade measures. We are actively monitoring the tariff developments and analyzing the potential impacts on our business, cost structure, supply chain and broader economic environment. We are identifying actions necessary to maintain competitiveness while we adapt to these new economic challenges. While these developments have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations to date, due to their evolving nature, and the expected persistence of macroeconomic conditions and volatility in the near term, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate impacts they may have on our business and results in the future, but those impacts could be material.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations\nA significant portion of our revenues, approximately 55% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025, was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because much of our manufacturing facilities and labor force costs are outside of the United States, a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in foreign exchange rates can therefore impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations\nKey factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations are summarized below.\nPart of our strategy for growth is to acquire complementary businesses that provide access to new technologies or geographies or expand our offerings. While acquisitions, as discussed further in Note 2, are not individually significant or significant in the aggregate, they may be relevant when comparing our results from period to period.\nRestructuring and Other Business Transformation Initiatives\nWe continue to execute business transformation initiatives. A key element of those initiatives are restructuring programs within our Industrial Technologies and Services and Precision and Science Technologies segments, as well as at the Corporate level. Restructuring charges, program related facility reorganization, relocation and other costs, and related capital expenditures were impacted most significantly.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nWe manage operations through the two business segments described above. In addition to our consolidated GAAP financial measures, we review various non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are helpful supplemental measures to assist us and investors in evaluating our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period to period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operations of our business. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash, non-recurring and other adjustment items. We believe that the adjustments applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about non-recurring items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income (loss) including interest, depreciation and amortization of non-acquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions.\nWe use Free Cash Flow to review the liquidity of our operations. We measure Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure for us and investors in assessing our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service our debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities.\nManagement and our board of directors regularly use these measures as tools in evaluating our operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual compensation. Such measures are provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable measures under GAAP. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers, many of which also present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.\nSee “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliation information.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated results should be read in conjunction with the segment results section herein and Note 19 “\nFor the Three Month Period Ended September 30,\nFor the Nine Month Period Ended September 30,\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Operations:\nSelling and administrative expenses\nAmortization of intangible assets\nImpairment of goodwill\nImpairment of other intangible assets\nOther operating expense, net\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nIncome before income taxes\nProvision for income taxes\nLoss on equity method investments\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\nNet income attributable to Ingersoll Rand Inc.\nPercentage of Revenues:\nSelling and administrative expenses\nOther Financial Data:\nCash flows - operating activities\nCash flows - investing activities\nCash flows - financing activities\nSee the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for a reconciliation to comparable GAAP measure.\nRevenues for the three month period ended September 30, 2025 were $1,955.0 million, an increase of $94.0 million, or 5.1%, compared to $1,861.0 million for the same three month period in 2024. The increase in revenues was primarily due to acquisitions of $88.3 million, higher pricing of $49.4 million, and favorable impact of foreign currencies of $30.0 million, partially offset by lower organic volumes of $73.7 million. The percentage of consolidated revenues derived from aftermarket parts and services was 36.3% in the three month period ended September 30, 2025 compared to 36.8% in the same three month period in 2024.\nRevenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 were $5,559.7 million, an increase of $223.3 million, or 4.2%, compared to $5,336.4 million for the same nine month period in 2024. The increase in revenues was primarily due to acquisitions\nof $344.2 million, higher pricing of $106.3 million, and favorable impact of foreign currencies of $30.1 million, partially offset by lower organic volumes of $257.3 million.
