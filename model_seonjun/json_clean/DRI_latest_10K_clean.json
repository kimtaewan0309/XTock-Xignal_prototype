  "item7_clean": "SALES\nThe following table presents our company-owned restaurant sales, U.S. same-restaurant sales (SRS) and average annual sales per restaurant by segment for the periods indicated:\nAverage Annual Sales per Restaurant (2)\nSRS (1)\nSame-restaurant sales is a year-over-year comparison of each period’s sales volumes for a 52-week year and is limited to restaurants that have been open, and operated by Darden, for at least 16 months.\nAverage annual sales are calculated as sales divided by total restaurant operating weeks multiplied by 52 weeks; excludes franchise locations.\nOlive Garden’s sales increase for fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by a U.S. same-restaurant sales increase combined with revenue from new restaurants. The increase in U.S. same-restaurant sales in fiscal 2025 resulted from a 4.1 percent increase in average check, which includes a 0.7 increase in off-premise catering sales, partially offset by a 2.3 percent decrease in same-restaurant guest counts.\nLongHorn Steakhouse’s sales increase for fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by a same-restaurant sales increase combined with revenue from new restaurants. The increase in same-restaurant sales in fiscal 2025 resulted from a 3.1 percent increase in average check and a 1.9 percent increase in same-restaurant guest counts.\nFine Dining’s sales increase for fiscal 2025 was driven by revenue from new restaurants offset by same-restaurant sales decreases. The decrease in same-restaurant sales in fiscal 2025 resulted from a 5.2 percent decrease in same-restaurant guest counts offset by a 2.3 percent increase in average check.\nOther Business’s sales increase for fiscal 2025 was driven by a U.S. same-restaurant sales increase combined with revenue from new restaurants including the acquisition of Chuy’s. The increase in same-restaurant sales in fiscal 2025 resulted from a 2.6 percent increase in average check offset by a 2.4 percent decrease in same-restaurant guest counts.\nCOSTS AND EXPENSES\nThe following table sets forth selected operating data as a percent of sales from continuing operations for the periods indicated. This information is derived from the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended May 25, 2025 and May 26, 2024.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nDepreciation and amortization\nImpairments and disposal of assets, net\nTotal operating costs and expenses\nEarnings before income taxes\nEarnings from continuing operations\nTotal operating costs and expenses from continuing operations were $10.71 billion in fiscal 2025 and $10.08 billion in fiscal 2024.\nFiscal 2025 Compared to Fiscal 2024:\nFood and beverage costs decreased as a percent of sales primarily due to a 0.9 percent impact from pricing leverage and a 0.2 percent impact from cost savings, partially offset by a 0.3 percent impact from mix and other and a 0.2 percent impact from inflation.\nRestaurant labor costs decreased as a percent of sales primarily due to a 0.8 percent impact from sales leverage, a 0.2 percent impact from productivity improvement and a 0.2 percent impact from lower benefits expense, partially offset by a 1.1 percent impact from inflation.\nRestaurant expenses increased as a percent of sales primarily due to a 0.5 percent impact from inflation, a 0.2 percent impact from brand mix, including Chuy’s and a 0.1 percent impact from Uber Direct fees, partially offset by a 0.4 percent impact from sales leverage and a 0.2 percent impact from other expenses.\nMarketing expenses increased as a percent of sales primarily due to increased marketing and media.\nPre-opening costs remained flat as a percent of sales.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased as a percent of sales primarily due to a 0.4 percent impact from Chuy’s acquisition and integration costs, 0.1 percent impact from inflation, a 0.1 percent impact from mark to market adjustments and a 0.1 percent impact from restaurant closures, partially offset by a 0.4 percent impact from reduced Ruth’s Chris acquisition and integration costs and by a 0.2 percent impact from sales leverage.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased as a percent of sales primarily due to the acquisition of Chuy’s as well as incremental depreciation on brand assets.\nImpairments and disposal of assets, net increased as a percent of sales primarily due to the decision to close twenty-two underperforming restaurant locations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe effective income tax rates for fiscal 2025 and 2024 for continuing operations were 11.5 percent and 12.3 percent, respectively. During fiscal 2025, we had income tax expense of $136.2 million on earnings before income tax of $1.19 billion\ncompared to income tax expense of $145.0 million on earnings before income taxes of $1.18 billion in fiscal 2024. This change was primarily driven by federal tax credits.\nH.R. 1., also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), was enacted on July 4, 2025. The legislation includes several provisions that may impact the timing and magnitude of certain tax deductions. Key provisions include the permanent extension of several business tax benefits originally introduced under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We are currently evaluating the provisions of the OBBBA to assess their potential impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nNET EARNINGS AND NET EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nNet earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2025 were $1.05 billion ($8.88 per diluted share) compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2024 of $1.03 billion ($8.53 per diluted share).\nNet earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2025 increased 2.0 percent and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4.1 percent compared with fiscal 2024.\nLOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nOn an after-tax basis, results from discontinued operations for fiscal 2025 were a net loss of $1.4 million ($0.02 per diluted share) compared with a net loss for fiscal 2024 of $2.9 million ($0.02 per diluted share).\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nWe manage our restaurant brands, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Chuy’s, Yard House, Ruth’s Chris, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Eddie V’s, Bahama Breeze and The Capital Burger in the U.S. and Canada as operating segments. We aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size, economic characteristics and sub-segment of full-service dining within which each brand operates. Our four reportable segments are: (1) Olive Garden, (2) LongHorn Steakhouse, (3) Fine Dining and (4) Other Business. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report) for further details.\nOur management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments. The following table presents segment profit margin for the periods indicated:\nBP\nBP\nBP\nBP\nThe increases in the Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse segment profit margins for fiscal 2025 were both driven primarily by positive same-restaurant sales and lower food and beverage costs, partially offset by higher restaurant expenses and marketing costs. The decrease in the Fine Dining segment profit margin for fiscal 2025 was driven primarily by negative same-restaurant sales and higher restaurant labor and restaurant expenses, partially offset by lower food and beverage costs. The increase in the Other Business segment profit margin for fiscal 2025 was driven primarily by positive same-restaurant sales and lower food and beverage costs, partially offset by increased restaurant expenses and marketing costs.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023\nSEASONALITY\nOur sales volumes have historically fluctuated seasonally. Our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring, followed by the fall and summer. Holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. Because of the historical seasonality of our business and these other factors, results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION\nWe attempt to minimize the annual effects of inflation through appropriate planning, operating practices and menu price increases. We recently operated in a period of higher than usual inflation, led by food and beverage cost and labor inflation. Food and beverage inflation is principally due to increased costs incurred by our vendors related to higher labor, transportation, packaging, and raw materials costs. Some of the impacts of inflation have been offset by menu price increases and other adjustments made during the year. Whether we are able and/or choose to continue to offset the effects of inflation will determine to what extent, if any, inflation affects our restaurant profitability in future periods.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report). Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We consider the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nWe evaluate our leases at their inception to estimate their expected term, which commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of the leased property and includes the non-cancelable base term plus all option periods we are reasonably certain to exercise. Our judgment in determining the appropriate expected term and discount rate for each lease affects our evaluation of:\nThe classification and accounting for leases as operating versus finance;\nThe rent holidays and escalation in payments that are included in the calculation of the lease liability and related right-of-use asset; and\nThe term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized.\nThese judgments may produce materially different amounts of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized on our consolidated balance sheets, as well as depreciation, amortization, interest and rent expense recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings if different discount rates and expected lease terms were used.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nLand, buildings and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and certain other assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; changes in expected useful life; unanticipated competition; slower growth rates, ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, or changes in the usage or operating performance. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Based on a review of operating results for each of our restaurants, given the current operating environment, the amount of net book value associated with lower performing restaurants that would be deemed at risk for impairment is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nValuation and Recoverability of Goodwill and Trademarks\nWe have eleven reporting units, eight of which have goodwill and nine of which have trademarks. Goodwill and trademarks are not subject to amortization and have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. The reporting units are our restaurant brands. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We review our goodwill and trademarks for impairment annually, as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for our annual review of goodwill and trademarks to determine whether or not indicators of impairment exist. In considering the qualitative approach related to goodwill, we evaluated factors including, but not limited to, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, commodity cost fluctuations, competitive environment, share price performance, results of prior impairment tests, operational stability, the overall financial performance of the reporting units and the impacts of discount rates. As it relates to trademarks, we evaluate similar factors from the goodwill assessment, in addition to impacts of royalty rates. As a result of the qualitative assessment, no indicators of impairment were identified, and no additional indicators of impairment were identified through the end of our fourth fiscal quarter that would require us to test further for impairment.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets to determine if they are definite or indefinite-lived. A determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.\nUnearned revenues primarily represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed. The estimated value of gift cards expected to remain unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed, generally over a period of 12 years. Utilizing this method, we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption. If actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates, actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded. We update our estimates of our redemption period and our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions on a prospective basis. Changing our breakage-rate estimates by 50 basis points would have resulted in an adjustment in our breakage income of approximately $3.5 million for fiscal 2025.\nWe estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes. These estimates include, among other items, depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes, allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported employee tip income, effective ra",
