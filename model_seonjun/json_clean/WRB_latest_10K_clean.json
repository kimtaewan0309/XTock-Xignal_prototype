Berkley Corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the United States and operates worldwide in two segments of the property casualty insurance business:\n- Our Insurance businesses underwrite predominantly commercial insurance business, including excess and surplus lines, admitted lines and specialty personal lines throughout the United States, as well as insurance business in Asia, Australia, Canada, Continental Europe, Mexico, Scandinavia, South America and the United Kingdom.\nReinsurance & Monoline Excess\n- Our Reinsurance businesses provide facultative and treaty reinsurance in the United States, the Asia Pacific region, Australia, Continental Europe, South Africa and the United Kingdom, as well as operations that solely retain risk on an excess basis and certain program management business.\nOur two reporting segments are each composed of individual businesses that serve a market defined by geography, products, services or industry served. Each of our businesses is positioned close to its customer base and participates in a niche market requiring specialized knowledge. This strategy of decentralized operations allows each of our businesses to identify and respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions and specific customer needs, while capitalizing on the benefits of centralized capital, investment and reinsurance management, and corporate actuarial, financial, enterprise risk management and compliance support.\nOur business approach is focused on meeting the needs of our customers, maintaining a high quality balance sheet, and allocating capital to our best opportunities. New businesses are started when opportunities are identified and when the right talent and expertise are found to lead a business. Of our 58 businesses, 51 have been organized and developed internally and seven have been added through acquisition.\nNet premiums written, as reported based on United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), for each of our reporting segments for each of the past three years were as follows:\n\nYear Ended December 31,\nNet premiums written:\nReinsurance & Monoline Excess\nPercentage of net premiums written:\nReinsurance & Monoline Excess\nThirty-three of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (\"A.M. Best\") and have financial strength ratings of A+ (Superior) (the second highest rating out of 15 possible ratings). A.M. Best's ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, insurance agents and brokers and are not directed toward the protection of investors. A.M. Best states: “A Best's Financial Strength Rating (FSR) is an independent opinion of an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. An FSR is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk.” A.M. Best reviews its ratings on a periodic basis, and its ratings of the Company's subsidiaries are therefore subject to change.\nOur twenty-three insurance company subsidiaries rated by Standard & Poor's (“S&P”) have financial strength ratings of A\n(the fifth highest rating out of twenty-seven possible ratings).\nOur Moody's financial strength ratings are A1 for Berkley Insurance Company, Berkley Regional Insurance Company and Admiral Insurance Company (the fifth highest rating out of twenty-one possible ratings).\nOur twenty-five insurance company subsidiaries rated by Fitch Ratings (\"Fitch\") have insurer financial strength ratings of AA- (the fourth highest rating out of twenty-seven possible ratings).\nOur Insurance businesses underwrite predominantly commercial and specialty personal lines insurance business primarily throughout the United States. Many units offer coverage globally, while others specialize in specific international markets. The Insurance businesses focus on the following general areas:\nExcess & Surplus Lines\n: A number of our businesses are dedicated to the U.S. excess and surplus lines market.

Products are generally distributed through wholesale agents and brokers.\n: Certain other businesses focus on providing specialty coverages to customers within a particular industry that are best served by underwriters and claims professionals with specialized knowledge of that industry. They offer multiple lines of business with policies tailored to address the unique exposures of these industries, often with the flexibility of providing coverages on either an admitted or a non-admitted basis in the U.S., as well as internationally.

The following table presents the Company’s net income to common stockholders and net income per diluted share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nNet income to common stockholders\nWeighted average diluted shares\nNet income per diluted share\nThe Company reported net income of $1,756 million in 2024 and $1,381 million in 2023. The $375 million increase in net income reflected an after-tax increase in net investment income of $217 million primarily due to higher interest rates, a larger fixed maturity securities portfolio and investment income associated with our Argentine inflation-linked securities, an after-tax increase in foreign currency gains of $65 million mainly due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in 2024, an after-tax increase in net investment gains of $55 million due to change in market value of equity securities and impairment loss recognized on a real estate investment in 2023, an after-tax increase in underwriting income of $37 million mainly due to growth in premium rates, an after-tax reduction in corporate expenses of $15 million, an after-tax increase of $4 million in noncontrolling interests, an after-tax increase in profits from non-insurance businesses of $3 million and an after-tax increase in profit from insurance service businesses of $3 million, partially offset by an increase of $24 million in tax expense due to a change in the effective tax rate. The number of weighted average diluted shares decreased by 6.7 million for 2024 compared to 2023, mainly reflecting shares repurchased in 2024.\n. Gross premiums written were $14,211 million in 2024, an increase of 10% from $12,972 million in 2023. The increase was due to the growth in the Insurance segment of $1,201 million and in the Reinsurance & Monoline Excess segment of $38 million. Approximately 81% of premiums expiring in 2024 and 2023 were renewed.\nAverage renewal premium rates (per unit of exposure) for insurance and facultative reinsurance increased 6.9% in 2024 and 7.1% in 2023. Average renewal premium rates (per unit of exposure) for insurance and facultative reinsurance excluding workers' compensation increased 7.9% in 2024 and 8.1% in 2023.\nA summary of gross premiums written in 2024 compared with 2023 by line of business within each business segment follows:\nInsurance gross premiums increased 10% to $12,662 million in 2024 from $11,461 million in 2023. Gross premiums increased $509 million (11%) for other liability, $476 million (17%) for short-tail lines, $179 million (12%) for auto, $21 million (1%) for professional liability and $16 million (1%) for workers' compensation.\nReinsurance & Monoline Excess gross premiums increased 3% to $1,549 million in 2024 from $1,511 million in 2023. Gross premiums written increased $68 million (16%) for property lines and $28 million (10%) for monoline excess, partially offset by a reduction of $58 million (7%) for casualty lines.\nNet premiums written were $11,972 million in 2024, an increase of 9% from $10,954 million in 2023. Ceded reinsurance premiums as a percentage of gross written premiums were 16% in both 2024 and 2023.\nPremiums earned increased 11% to $11,548 million in 2024 from $10,401 million in 2023. Insurance premiums (including the impact of rate changes) are generally earned evenly over the policy term, and accordingly recent rate increases will be earned over the upcoming quarters. Premiums earned in 2024 are related to business written during both 2024 and 2023. Audit premiums were $350 million in 2024 compared with $363 million in 2023.\nNet Investment Income\n. Following is a summary of net investment income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nFixed maturity securities, including cash and cash equivalents and loans receivable\nArbitrage trading account\nGross investment income\nNet investment income increased 27% to $1,333 million in 2024 from $1,053 million in 2023 due primarily to a $331 million increase in income from fixed maturity securities mainly driven by higher interest rates, a larger fixed maturity securities portfolio and investment income associated with our Argentine inflation-linked securities (see below for further discussion), partially offset by a $28 million decrease in income from investment funds primarily due to financial service funds, a $12 million decrease in real estate, a $7 million decrease from equity securities and a $4 million increase in investment expenses. Investment funds are reported on a one quarter lag. The average annualized yield for fixed maturity securities was 5.3% in 2024 and 4.4% in 2023. The effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was 2.6 years at December 31, 2024 and 2.4 years at December 31, 2023. Average invested assets, at cost (including cash and cash equivalents), were $28.9 billion in 2024 up 9.5% from $26.4 billion in 2023.\nPre-tax net investment income associated with the Argentine inflation-linked securities in 2024 was $204 million. Such investment income increased as a result of an adjustment to the inflation rate that was made by the Argentine government in late 2023. As certain of our Argentine bonds matured and were sold throughout 2024 and the inflation rate continued to decline, we do not expect investment income relating to these securities to continue at this level. The proceeds from the Argentine inflation-linked securities that matured and were sold in 2024 have been reinvested.\nInsurance Service Fees\n. The Company earns fees from an insurance distribution business (part of which was sold in June 2023), a third-party administrator, and as a servicing carrier of workers' compensation assigned risk plans for certain states. Insurance service fees increased to $109 million in 2024 from $106 million in 2023 due to an acquisition in the insurance distribution business in late 2023.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments\n. The Company buys and sells securities and other investment assets on a regular basis in order to maximize its total return on investments. Decisions to sell securities and other\ninvestment assets are based on management’s view of the underlying fundamentals of specific investments as well as management’s expectations regarding interest rates, credit spreads, currency values and general economic conditions. Net realized and unrealized gains on investments were $80 million in 2024 compared with $48 million in 2023. In 2024, the gains reflected a change in unrealized gains on equity securities of $121 million, partially offset by net realized losses on investments of $41 million. In 2023, the gains reflected a change in unrealized gains on equity securities of $71 million, partially offset by net realized losses on investments of $23 million.\nChange in Allowance for Expected Credit Losses on Investments.\nBased on credit factors, the allowance for expected credit losses is increased or decreased depending on the percentage of unrealized loss relative to amortized cost by security, changes in rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. The pre-tax change in allowance for expected credit losses on investments reflected in net investment gains, decreased by $38 million ($30 million after-tax) in 2024 due to improved pricing associated with foreign government securities and corporate securities, and increased by $498 thousand ($393 thousand after-tax) in 2023.\nRevenues from Non-Insurance Businesses\n. Revenues from non-insurance businesses were derived from businesses engaged in the distribution of promotional merchandise, world-wide textile solutions, and aviation-related businesses that provide services to aviation markets, including (i) the distribution, manufacturing, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and components, (ii) the sale of new and used aircraft, and (iii) avionics, fuel, maintenance, storage and charter services. Revenues from non-insurance businesses decreased to $528 million in 2024 from $536 million in 2023 mainly due to the aviation-related business and the promotional merchandise business.\nLosses and Loss Expenses\n. Losses and loss expenses increased to $7,132 million in 2024 from $6,372 million in 2023. The consolidated loss ratio was 61.8% in 2024 and 61.3% in 2023. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, were $298 million in 2024 driven by heightened frequency of severe catastrophe events, with Hurricanes Helene and Milton having the largest impacts, and $195 million in 2023. Favorable prior year reserve development (net of premium offsets) was $4 million in 2024 and adverse prior year reserve development was $19 million in 2023 (refer to Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for more detail). The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development were 59.2% in both 2024 and 2023.\nA summary of loss ratios in 2024 compared with 2023 by business segment follows:\n- The loss ratio was 62.8% in 2024 and 62.3% in 2023. Catastrophe losses were $227 million in 2024 compared with $160 million in 2023. Adverse prior year reserve development was $8 million in 2024 and $21 million in 2023, principally from property catastrophe losses for 2023. The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development increased 0.2 points to 60.5% in 2024 from 60.3% in 2023.\nReinsurance & Monoline Excess\n- The loss ratio was 54.7% in 2024 and 54.3% in 2023. Catastrophe losses were $71 million in 2024 compared with $35 million in 2023. Favorable prior year reserve development was $12 million in 2024 and $2 million in 2023. The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development decreased 1.3 points to 50.6% in 2024 from 51.9% in 2023.\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\n. Following is a summary of other operating costs and expenses:\nPolicy acquisition and insurance operating expenses\nInsurance service expenses\nNet foreign currency (gains) losses\nOther costs and expenses\nPolicy acquisition and insurance operating expenses are comprised of commissions paid to agents and brokers, premium taxes and other assessments and internal underwriting costs. Policy acquisition and insurance operating expenses increased 12% and net premiums earned increased 11% from 2023. The expense ratio (policy acquisition and insurance operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned) increased by 0.1 points to 28.5% in 2024 from 28.4% in 2023.\nService expenses, which represent the costs associated with the fee-based businesses, was $91 million in 2024 compared to $92 million in 2023.\nNet foreign currency (gains) losses result from transactions denominated in a currency other than a businesses’ functional currency. Net foreign currency gains were $52 million in 2024 compared to losses of $32 million in 2023, primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against other major currencies in 2024.\nOther costs and expenses represent general and administrative expenses of the parent company and other expenses not allocated to business segments, including the cost of certain long-term incentive plans and new business ventures. Other costs and expenses decreased to $269 million in 2024 from $286 million in 2023, primarily due to lower new start-up operating unit expenses in 2024.\nExpenses from Non-Insurance Businesses\n. Expenses from non-insurance businesses represent costs associated with businesses engaged in the distribution of promotional merchandise, world-wide textile solutions, and aviation-related businesses that include (i) cost of goods sold related to aircraft and products sold and services provided and (ii) general and administrative expenses. Expenses from non-insurance businesses decreased to $513 million in 2024 from $525 million in 2023, primarily due to the aviation-related business and promotional merchandise business.\n. Interest expense was $127 million in both 2024 and 2023.\nThe effective income tax rate was 22.5% in 2024 and 21.1% in 2023. The higher effective income tax rate for the year, as compared to 2023, was primarily due to the geographical mix of earnings and larger amounts being subject to tax at a rate greater than the U.S. statutory rate, which was partially offset by tax benefits related to tax-exempt investment income and equity-based compensation. See Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the income tax expense and the amounts computed by applying the Federal income tax rate of 21%.\nThe Company has not provided U.S. deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of approximately $481 million of its non-U.S. subsidiaries since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the non-U.S. subsidiaries. In the future, if such earnings were distributed, the Company projects that the incremental tax, if any, will be immaterial.\nFor years beginning after December 31, 2025, certain U.S. tax rates applied to international business will change. Specifically, increases to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income and the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax rates will take effect. We do not expect this to have a meaningful impact to tax expense. We are actively monitoring legislative developments and will continue to assess the potential financial implications in 2025.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted. Among other things, the legislation introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax on certain corporations. The tax is applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022 and imposes a 15% minimum tax on a corporation’s applicable financial statement income. While we are not subject to this tax in 2024, we continue to evaluate the overall impact of this tax legislation on our operations and U.S. federal income tax position. In addition, a 1% excise tax is now imposed on the value of corporate share repurchases, net of common share issuances. The tax is included in the cost of treasury stock acquired and was not material for 2024.\nFurther, the Company is monitoring the impact of the implementation of a global minimum tax rate of 15%, also known as Pillar Two, as introduced by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which applies in some countries commencing in 2024. The 2024 impact was not material, as the Company mainly operates in jurisdictions with a statutory tax rate above 15%. We continue to evaluate this tax legislation as it will apply to other countries commencing in 2025, as well as possible interactions between Pillar Two measures and recent and potential future actions by the new U.S. administration. Our initial assessment is that the 2025 impact will not be significant.\nThe “Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act 2023” was passed into law December 27, 2023. The income tax will be based on a statutory tax rate of 15% on Bermuda businesses, subject to reductions for foreign tax credits, and will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The legislation does not have a material impact on our income tax position. We will continue to evaluate tax legislation developments during 2025.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nAs part of its investment strategy, the Company establishes a level of cash and highly liquid short-term and intermediate-term securities that, combined with expected cash flow, it believes is adequate to meet its payment obligations. In addition to fixed maturity securities, the Company invests in equity securities, merger arbitrage securities, investment funds, private equity, loans and real estate related assets. The Company's investments in investment funds and its other alternative investments have experienced, and ",
