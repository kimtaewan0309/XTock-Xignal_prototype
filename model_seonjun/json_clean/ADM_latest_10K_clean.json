  "item7_clean": "Revenues and cost of products sold in agricultural merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes. In periods of significant changes in market prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment, generally have a relatively equal impact from market price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.\nRevenues decreased $8.4 billion to $85.5 billion driven by lower sales prices ($16.0 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes ($7.6 billion). Lower sales prices of soybeans, corn, meal, oils, wheat and alcohol, were partially offset by higher sales volumes of soybeans, corn, oils, wheat, alcohol, and flavors. Ag Services and Oilseeds revenues decreased 9% to $66.5 billion driven by lower sales prices ($13.5 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes ($6.6 billion). Carbohydrate Solutions revenues decreased 13% to $11.2 billion driven by lower sales prices ($2.3 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes ($612 million). Nutrition revenues increased 2% to $7.3 billion driven by higher sales volumes ($386 million), partially offset by lower sales prices ($248 million).\nCost of products sold decreased $6.7 billion to $79.8 billion driven primarily by lower average commodity costs. Manufacturing expenses increased $288 million primarily driven by increased salaries and benefits driven by salary increases, higher depreciation expenses, increased legal, professional, and other fees, increased maintenance expenses due to work performed at Ag Services and Oilseeds facilities in Decatur, Illinois and the Company's new facility in Spiritwood, North Dakota, among others, partially offset by decreases in energy costs, particularly driven by lower energy pricing in North America and EMEA.\nForeign currency translation impacts decreased revenues by $335 million and cost of goods sold by $290 million, decreasing gross profit by $45 million.\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGross profit decreased $1.7 billion or 23%, to $5.8 billion driven by lower margins in Ag Services, which decreased by $300 million to $1.2 billion, Crushing, which decreased $518 million to $991 million, Refined Products and Other, which decreased $709 million to $554 million, Starches and Sweeteners, which decreased by $112 million to $1.4 billion, and Human Nutrition, which decreased by $77 million to $941 million, partially offset by higher margins in Animal Nutrition, which increased $62 million to $509 million.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased 7% to $3.7 billion driven by higher legal and financing fees, higher salary and benefit costs, and increased amortization of intangibles, driven by the Company’s investment in computer software and intangibles acquired in business combinations, partially offset by decreased incentive compensation reflecting lower Company performance and reduced provisions for bad debt.\nAsset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs increased $203 million to $545 million. Charges in 2024 included a $461 million impairment related to the Company's Wilmar equity investment, $43 million of impairments related to customer lists and discontinued trademarks in the Animal Nutrition subsegment, $4 million of reportable segment specific restructuring charges and $23 million of restructuring in Corporate. Charges in 2023 consisted of $137 million of impairments related to goodwill in the Animal Nutrition reporting unit, $108 million of impairments related to property, plant, and equipment and an equity method investment, $64 million of impairments related to customer list and discontinued Animal Nutrition trademarks, $27 million of reportable segment specific restructuring charges, and $6 million of restructuring in Corporate.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $70 million to $621 million due primarily to higher earnings from the Company’s investments in Almidones Mexicanos S.A., Wilmar, Skyland Grain, LLC, and Hungrana Ltd., partially offset by lower earnings from the Company’s investment in Olenex Sarl and SoyVen. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had sold its interest in Skyland Grain, LLC.\nInterest and investment income increased $63 million to $562 million driven by lower investment valuation losses in 2024 of $16 million, a decrease of $60 million when compared to the prior year, and higher interest income within Ag Services and Oilseeds ($30 million, compared to the prior year of $0), driven by bond investments within South America, partially offset by lower net interest income (decrease of $36 million) for ADM Investor Services due to lower customer balances.\nInterest expense increased $59 million to $706 million driven by increased use of the Company’s commercial paper borrowing programs.\n\nThe Company is continuing to cooperate with the SEC and DOJ investigations and is unable to predict the outcome of these investigations.\nIn connection with the Investigation, the Company identified a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting related to its accounting practices and procedures for segment disclosures. For more information, see “Controls and Procedures” in Part II, Item 9A herein.\nOperating Performance Indicators\nThe Company’s Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions segments are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials. As a result, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold. Therefore, margins per volume or metric ton generally are meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses.\nThe Company's Nutrition segment also utilizes agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold. As a result, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins. Therefore margin rates generally are meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses.\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company has consolidated subsidiaries in approximately 80 countries. For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except for certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency, and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. For the majority of the Company’s business activities in Brazil and Argentina, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency. Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar.\nThe Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), margins, segment operating profit, total segment operating profit, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, return on invested capital, adjusted economic value added, and operating cash flows before working capital. Some of these metrics are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. For more information, see the “\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, trade policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, global production of similar and competitive crops, and geopolitical developments. Due to the unpredictable nature of these and other factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nMarket Factors Influencing Operations or Results in the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024\nThe Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company’s operating results, including those discussed below related to 2024.\nIn the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment, following two years of very favorable market conditions, several headwinds in the agriculture cycle, including fewer market dislocations and high cost inflation, led to more normalized results throughout the entire value chain. Ag Services benefited from improved river conditions and an excellent crop in North America, which improved export volumes, while South America Origination margins were negatively impacted by take or pay contracts with railroads. Global Trade market conditions were driven by solid trading and continued structured trade finance opportunities. Crushing saw depressed vegetable oil demand and lower prices primarily driven by increased market supply, imports of used cooking oil, uncertainty with the Producer Tax Credit policy change, and the delay of the European Union's Deforestation Regulation requirements. In Refined Products and Other, North America margins were pressured by an increase in the supply of low carbon intensity feedstock and limited forward sales opportunities caused by the uncertainty around Producers Tax Credit policy transition.\nIn the Carbohydrate Solutions segment, demand for starches and sweeteners remained solid with margins remaining steady across the entire portfolio. Strong export demand for ethanol helped offset higher industry production to minimize the imbalance between supply and demand.\nIn the Nutrition segment, demand was mixed in a few food and beverage product categories driven by shifts in consumer discretionary spend and preferences. Human Nutrition was impacted by inflation, which drove lower demand and decreased volumes for alternative proteins in some regions. Demand started to recover in the food, beverage, and dietary supplement categories. In Animal Nutrition, a soft amino acids market driven by price weakness in North America was partially offset by an improved market in EMEA. The global feed market saw some modest improvement with continued price weakness of main feed ration commodities, while key livestock prices remained steady. The feed additives market was impacted by volatility on vitamins due to supply disruptions, however overall it modestly improved, following the improvement in the feed sector.\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nProcessed volumes by product for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows (in metric tons):\n\nIn the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment, segment operating profit decreased 40%. The Ag Services subsegment operating profit was lower than 2023. South America Origination margins decreased driven by lower origination volumes and margin compression due to slow farmer selling and higher industry rail freight take or pay agreements. North America grain exports were not competitive with South America, leading to weak exports and costs from a carry market contributed to slow farmer selling, limiting trade opportunities in the first half of the year. Execution in destination marketing as well as effective risk management continued to deliver strong Global Trade results in 2024, though lower than 2023. The Crushing subsegment operating profit was lower than 2023, particularly in North America. Increased industry capacity pressured Crushing margins and an increased supply of competing low carbon intensity feedstocks, and the European Union's Deforestation Regulation delay negatively affected margins. For 2024, there were approximately $20 million of net positive mark-to-market timing effects, compared to approximately $185 million of net positive impacts in 2023. The Crushing subsegment current year operating results also included $76 million of insurance proceeds for the partial settlement of the Decatur East and West insurance claims related to incidents in 2023. The Refined Products and Other (RPO) subsegment operating profit was lower than 2023 as increased pre-treatment capacity at renewable diesel facilities, higher imports of used cooking oil, aggressive competition among food suppliers to serve customer demand, and biofuel policy uncertainty negatively impacted margins. There were net negative timing impact of approximately $430 million year-over-year.\nIn the Carbohydrate Solutions segment, segment operating profit was flat compared to the prior year. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment operating profit was higher year-over-year driven by improved cost position on higher utilization rates, higher joint-venture earnings, and $84 million of insurance proceeds for the partial settlement of the Decatur East and Decatur West insurance claims related to an incident that occurred in 2023. Strong margins and volumes in North America were offset by weaker domestic ethanol margins, co-product values, and margins in EMEA. The Vantage Corn Processors subsegment results decreased year-over-year driven by lower margins, due to higher industry production and inventory levels, partially offset by higher volumes driven by increased exports.\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn the Nutrition segment, segment operating profit decreased 9%. Human Nutrition results were lower than the prior year. Specialty Ingredients was impacted by unplanned downtime at Decatur East, higher costs of goods sold associated with the termination of an unfavorable supply agreement, and a normalizing texturants market negatively impacted margins, partially offset by\n\nRestructuring charges\nInterest expense-net increased $51 million driven by increased borrowings and higher interest rates on the Company’s commercial paper borrowing programs and increased interest expense relating to uncertain tax positions.\nUnallocated corporate costs increased $61 million driven by increases in legal and professional fees and securitization fees, offset by decreased incentive compensation driven by lower Company performance.\nRestructuring charges increased $17 million driven by $10 million relating to foreign restructuring charges.\nOther expense in the current year included railroad maintenance expenses of $64 million and net valuation losses of approximately $16 million in the Company’s ADM Ventures portfolio. Other income in the current year also included foreign exchange gains of $78 million and the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $18 million. Other expense in the prior year included the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $18 million and foreign exchange gains, partially offset by railroad maintenance expenses of $67 million and investment revaluation losses of $57 million.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses certa",
