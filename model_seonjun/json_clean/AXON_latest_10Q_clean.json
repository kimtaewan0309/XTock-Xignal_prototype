The increase in tax provision is driven by lower pre-tax book income in the current period, magnifying the impact of permanent and discrete items. The major driver of the increase in rate was the enactment of the OBBBA in the quarter, which resulted in a reduction of our R&D tax credit, partially offset by the net tax benefit related to stock-based compensation.\nProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nIncome before provision for income taxes\nProvision for income taxes\nWe recorded net loss of $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to net income of $67.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.
