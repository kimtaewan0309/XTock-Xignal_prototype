Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (\"Walmart,\" the \"Company,\" \"our,\" \"us\" or \"we\") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2026 (\"fiscal 2026\") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 (\"fiscal 2025\"), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six months ended July 31, 2025, and the accompanying notes included in\nRecent Developments, Macroeconomic Conditions and Potential Impacts\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nItem 5. Other Information\nIn July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted, introducing a series of corporate tax changes in the U.S., including 100% bonus depreciation on qualified property and full expensing for research and development expenditures. The impacts of the Tax Act are reflected in our results for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2025, and there was no material impact to our income tax expense or effective tax rate. We expect certain provisions will decrease cash taxes paid in the current fiscal year and may change the timing of cash tax payments in future periods.\nFor a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to \"\nResults of Operations\nCompany Performance Metrics\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows:\nGrowth - serve customers through a seamless omnichannel experience;\nMargin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and\nReturns - improve our Return on Investment through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend.\nOur objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through our omnichannel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club U.S. and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omnichannel initiatives that complement our strategy.\nComparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We focus on comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year.\nCalendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and six months ended July 31, 2025 and 2024, were as follows:\n\nComparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 4.4% and 3.8% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2025, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 4.7% and for 3.9% the three and six months ended July 31, 2025, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, reflecting strength in all merchandise categories. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce net sales positively contributed approximately 4.0% and 3.7% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2025, respectively. This growth reflects continued strength in customer and Walmart+ member engagement with omnichannel offerings, which was primarily driven by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery.\nComparable sales in the Sam's Club U.S. segment increased 3.3% and 3.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2025, respectively, driven by growth in unit volumes with strength in transactions, reflecting strong sales in grocery, health and wellness, and general merchandise. The Sam's Club U.S. segment's eCommerce net sales positively contributed approximately 3.4% to comparable sales for both the three and six months ended July 31, 2025, which outpaced the total segment growth as a result of lower fuel sales. This growth reflects continued strength in member engagement with omnichannel offerings.\nOur objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth by driving incremental margin accretion through a combination of productivity improvements, as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs, and we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") expenses. Additionally, we focus on our mix of businesses, including expanding our ecosystem in higher margin areas, such as digital advertising and marketplace. Our objective is to achieve operating income leverage, which we define as growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales.\nThree Months Ended July 31,\nSix Months Ended July 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\nPercentage change from comparable period\nPercentage change from comparable period\nPercentage of net sales\nGross profit defined as net sales less cost of sales.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\") increased 4 and 8 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2025, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to the Walmart U.S. segment, driven by disciplined inventory management and growth in higher margin businesses, partially offset by mix shifts into lower margin merchandise categories. Additionally, the increases were partially offset by ongoing channel and format mix shifts in the Walmart International segment.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 64 and 35 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2025, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, which reflect charges of $0.4 billion related to certain legal matters. The increases for the three and six months ended July 31, 2025 were also impacted by higher self-insured general liability claims expense in the U.S. of approximately $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, influenced by rising costs to resolve claims across retail and related industries.\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales decreased 58 and 27 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2025, respectively, primarily due to the factors described above.\nAs we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nReturn on Assets and Return on Investment\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\") and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess our return on capital. ROA is the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") while ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart deploys its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial metric because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in ROA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. ROA is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and averaged accrued liabilities for that period. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.\nThe calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:\n\nSix Months Ended July 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\nNet cash used in financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased slightly for the six months ended July 31, 2025, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to increased share repurchases, lower short-term borrowings in the current fiscal year and higher dividends paid, primarily offset by new long-term debt issued in the current fiscal year as well as lower debt repayments.\nIn April 2025, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-da"
