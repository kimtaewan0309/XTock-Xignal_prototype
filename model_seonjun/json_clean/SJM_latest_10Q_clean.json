Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(Dollars and shares in millions, unless otherwise noted, except per share data)\nThis discussion and analysis deals with comparisons of material changes in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024. All comparisons presented are to the corresponding period of the prior year, unless otherwise noted.\nOn March 3, 2025, we sold certain Sweet Baked Snacks value brands to JTM. The transaction included certain trademarks and licenses, a manufacturing facility in Chicago, Illinois, and approximately 400 employees who supported the business. Under our ownership, these Sweet Baked Snacks value brands generated net sales of approximately $48.4 in 2025, which were included in the Sweet Baked Snacks segment. Net proceeds from the divestiture were $34.6, inclusive of the final working capital adjustment and cash transaction costs. We recognized a pre-tax loss of $44.2 on this transaction, primarily during the third quarter of 2025.\nOn December 2, 2024, we sold the\nbusiness to Second Nature. The transaction included products sold under the\nbrand, inclusive of certain trademarks, a leased manufacturing facility in Burlington, Ontario, and approximately 300 employees who supported the business. Under our ownership, the\nbusiness generated net sales of approximately $86.3 in 2025, which were included in the Sweet Baked Snacks segment. Net proceeds from the divestiture were $291.4, inclusive of the final working capital adjustment and cash transaction costs. We recognized a pre-tax loss of $265.9 on this transaction, primarily during the second quarter of 2025.\nWe are the owner of all trademarks referenced herein, except for the following, which are used under license:\nis a trademark of DD IP Holder LLC used under three licenses (the “Dunkin’ Licenses”) for packaged coffee products, including K-Cup\npods, sold in retail channels, such as grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, e-commerce, and drug stores, as well as in certain away from home channels. The Dunkin’ Licenses do not pertain to coffee or other products for sale in\nis a trademark of Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., used with permission.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nDuring the first half of 2026, we continued to experience input cost inflation and a dynamic macroeconomic environment, inclusive of tariffs, regulatory and policy changes, and changes in consumer behaviors, which we anticipate will persist through the remainder of 2026. Further, the higher costs have required price increases across our business, and we anticipate the price elasticity of demand could remain elevated during 2026 as consumers continue to experience broader inflationary pressures and are selective in their spending. In response to the inflationary pressures, we continue to focus on the delivery of our company-wide transformation initiative to deliberately translate our continuous improvement mindset into sustainable productivity initiatives in order to grow our profit margins and reinvest in the Company to enable future growth and cost savings.\nIn addition, it is possible significant disruptions in our supply chain could occur if certain geopolitical events continue to impact markets around the world, including the impact of potential shipping delays due to supply and demand imbalances, as well as labor shortages and tariffs. We also continue to work closely with our customers and external business partners, taking additional actions to ensure safety and business continuity and to maximize product availability. We have maintained production at all our facilities and availability of appointments at distribution centers.\nAlthough we do not have any operations in Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Palestine, China, or Taiwan, we continue to monitor these environments, among others, for any significant escalation or expansion of economic or supply chain disruptions, including broader inflationary costs and the impact of tariffs, as well as regional or global economic recessions. Overall, broad-based supply chain disruptions and the impact of inflation remain uncertain. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent to which supply chain disruptions and inflation will impact our business, supply chain, including labor availability and attrition, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nResults of Operations\n\nSelling, distribution, and administrative expenses:\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal selling, distribution, and administrative expenses\nOther special project costs\nLoss (gain) on divestitures – net\nOther operating expense (income) – net\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nGross profit decreased $16.2, or 2 percent, in the second quarter of 2026, primarily driven by higher commodity costs, unfavorable volume/mix, tariffs, and the noncomparable impact of divestitures, partially offset by higher net price realization and a net favorable impact of derivative gains and losses.\nOperating income increased $248.8, or 147 percent, in the second quarter of 2026, primarily driven by lapping the $260.8 pre-tax loss on the\nbusiness disposal group classified as held for sale in the prior year, lower amortization expense, and a decrease in other special project costs, partially offset by the decrease in gross profit and an increase in selling, distribution, and administrative (“SD&A”) expenses.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets, special project costs, gains and losses on divestitures, the change in net cumulative unallocated derivative gains and losses, and other infrequently occurring items that do not directly reflect ongoing operating results. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this discussion and analysis for additional information. Gross profit excluding non-GAAP adjustments (“adjusted gross profit”) decreased $89.8, or 10 percent, as compared to the prior year second quarter, reflecting the exclusion of the change in net cumulative unallocated derivative gains and losses and special project costs as compared to GAAP gross profit. Adjusted operating income decreased $96.3, or 20 percent, as compared to the prior year second quarter, further reflecting the exclusion of the $260.8 pre-tax loss for the assets held for sale in the prior year, amortization expense, and other special project costs.\nGross profit decreased $338.7, or 20 percent, in the first six months of 2026, primarily driven by higher commodity costs, a net unfavorable impact of derivative gains and losses, unfavorable volume/mix, tariffs, and the noncomparable impact of divestitures, partially offset by higher net price realization.\nOperating income decreased $55.1, or 11 percent, in the first six months of 2026, primarily reflecting the decrease in gross profit, partially offset by lapping the $260.8 pre-tax loss on the\nbusiness disposal group classified as held for sale in the prior year, lower amortization expense, and decreases in other special project costs and SD&A expenses.\nAdjusted gross profit decreased $179.1, or 10 percent, as compared to the prior year, reflecting the exclusion of the change in net cumulative unallocated derivative gains and losses and special project costs as compared to GAAP gross profit. Adjusted operating income decreased $173.9, or 19 percent, as compared to the prior year, further reflecting the exclusion of the $260.8 pre-tax loss for the assets held for sale in the prior year, amortization expense, and other special project costs..\nNet interest expense was comparable to the prior year for the three and six months ended October 31, 2025. For additional information, refer to Note 7: Debt and Financing Arrangements.\nThe effective income tax rates for the three months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, were 24.2 and 136.7 percent, respectively, and for the six months ended October 31, 2025 and 2024, were 24.6 and 48.7 percent, respectively. During the current year, the effective income tax rates varied from the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21.0 percent, primarily due to state income taxes. During the prior year, the effective income tax rates varied from the U.S. statutory income tax rate of 21.0 percent, primarily due to unfavorable impacts of the classification of the\nbusiness as held for sale. We anticipate a full-year effective income tax rate for 2026 to be approximately 24.2 percent. For additional information, refer to Note 12: Income Taxes.\nSpecial Project Costs\n: Total divestiture costs incurred to date related to the\nand Canada condiment businesses that were divested in 2024 were $6.4, which included $4.3 and $2.1 of employee-related and other transition and termination costs, respectively, all of which were cash charges. We did not incur any divestiture costs during the three and six months ended October 31, 2025, and incurred divestiture costs of $0.1 and $0.4 during the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, primarily consisting of employee-related costs. We do not anticipate any additional costs to be incurred related to these divestiture activities.\nAs a result of our recent divestitures, we identified opportunities to address certain distribution inefficiencies. We anticipate incurring approximately $12.0 of costs related to these efforts, consisting primarily of other transition and termination charges. The majority of these costs are expected to be cash charges and incurred by the end of 2026. We have recognized total cumulative costs of $8.4, of which $1.6 and $1.9 were recognized during the three and six months ended October 31, 2025, respectively, and $0.8 and $0.9 during the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, respectively, primarily consisting of other transition and termination costs.\n: On November 7, 2023, we completed a cash and stock transaction to acquire Hostess B"
