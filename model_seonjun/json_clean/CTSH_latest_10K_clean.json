  "item1_clean": "Reportable Business Segments\nIn 2024, we went to market across seven industry-based operating segments, which are aggregated into four reportable business segments:\nHealth Sciences (HS)\n- This reportable business segment is comprised of a single operating segment of the same name.\nFinancial Services (FS)\nProducts and Resources (P&R)\nRetail and Consumer Goods\nManufacturing, Logistics, Energy and Utilities\nTravel and Hospitality\nCommunications, Media and Technology (CMT)\n- This reportable business segment is comprised of a single operating segment of the same name.\nBeginning in 2025, we go to market across four industry-based operating segments, which will match our four reportable business segments - (i) Health Sciences (ii) Financial Services (iii) Products and Resources and (iv) Communications, Media and Technology. These changes reflect how the operating segments will be managed and reported to the CODM but will not affect the reportable segments' financial results.\nOur clients seek to partner with service providers that have a deep understanding of their businesses, industry initiatives, customers, markets and cultures and the ability to create solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs. Across industries, our clients are confronted with the risk of being disrupted by nimble, digital-native competitors. Our clients increasingly feel the need to transform and are therefore redirecting their focus and investment to new operating models and embracing DevOps, AI and other key technologies that enable quick adjustments to shifts in their markets. We believe that our deep knowledge of our clients’ businesses and the industries we serve has been central to our growth and high client satisfaction, and we continue to develop and deploy our client-centric culture, innovating together to produce transformative outcomes.\nOur HS segment consists of healthcare providers and payers, and life sciences companies, including pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies. Demand in this segment is driven by emerging industry trends, including the shift towards consumerism, outcome-based care, digital health and delivering seamless, patient-centered experiences. These trends result in increased demand for services that drive operational improvements in areas such as clinical development, pharmacovigilance and manufacturing, as well as claims processing, enrollment, membership and revenue cycle management. Demand is also created by the adoption and integration of digital technologies such as AI and predictive data analytics to improve clinical trial designs, data security, patient engagement and care outcomes.\nOur FS segment includes banking, capital markets, payments and insurance companies. Demand in this segment is driven by our clients’ need to modernize legacy infrastructure and adopt digital technologies to serve their customers while complying with significant regulatory requirements and adapting to market changes. These technologies enable enhanced customer experience, through automation, analytics and AI-driven value creation in areas such as digital lending, hyper-personalized banking, fraud detection, underwriting and next-generation payments. Clients are also increasingly leveraging technology services partners as end-to-end orchestrators uniting hyperscalers, independent software vendors, fintech players, data providers, and enterprise and business process management\n\nprocess automation, AI adoption, operational efficiency, unified user experiences and the generation of new revenue streams. In response to this demand, our focus areas include network monetization, media supply chain transformation, product engineering, AI integration, verticalization, data modernization and customer experience design.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the distribution of our revenues across our four reportable business segments was as follows:\nThe services we provide are distributed among a number of clients in each of our reportable business segments. The volume of work performed for specific clients may vary significantly from year to year. A loss of a significant client or a few significant clients in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment. The services we provide to our larger clients are often critical to their operations and termination of our services would typically require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues.\nto our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to disaggregation of revenues by client location, service line and contract-type for each of our reportable business segments.\nServices and Solutions\nOur services include AI and other technology services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, quality engineering and assurance, application maintenance, infrastructure and security as well as business process services and automation. Additionally, we develop, license, implement and support proprietary and third-party software products and platforms. Central to our strategy to align with our clients’ need for continuous transformation is our sustained investment in new technologies, including new forms of AI, cloud, data modernization, automation, digital engineering and IoT. These capabilities enable clients to put AI at the core of their operations, improve the experiences they offer to their customers, tap into new revenue streams, automate operations, defend against digital- and AI-native competitors and reduce costs.\nIn most cases, our clients operate in hybrid technology environments, running critical new digital initiatives alongside essential legacy systems. In the AI era, our clients have an accelerated need to modernize their businesses, which has intensified demand for next-gen capabilities in AI, automation, digital commerce and secure distributed work. We believe our deep understanding of our clients' established systems and their digital ambitions provides us with a unique advantage as we work with them to architect solutions that are both transformative and practical.\nOur services and solutions are organized into six integrated practices, which help us deliver these capabilities in ways that align with each client’s specific transformation journey. These practices are Core Technologies and Insights, Enterprise Platform Services, Industry Solutions, Intuitive Operations and Automation, Software and Platform Engineer\ning, and Cognizant Moment, our new digital experience practice.\nOur consulting professionals have deep industry-specific expertise and work closely across our practices to create intuitive operating models that leverage a wide range of technologies across our clients’ enterprises to deliver higher levels of efficiency, new value for their customers and business outcomes that align to their industries.\n\nEnterprise Platform Services\nOur Enterprise Platform Services practice helps our clients transform multiple front- and back-office business processes, implementing enterprise-wide platforms that enable customer experience, customer relationship management, human capital management, supply chain management, enterprise resource planning and financial processes. Our services decrease time to market, drive efficiencies and deliver impactful experiences. Our clients can better share information, simplify IT processes, automate workflow and improve flexibility. This practice focuses on application services, which help enterprises engage their partner ecosystems more productively, and run their operations and financial organizations more efficiently while enabling improved employee and customer experiences. We work closely with partners including Adobe, Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Pegasystems, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Workday and many others.\nOur Industry Solutions practice was established in 2023 as part of Cognizant’s strategy to build differentiation at the industry level. The practice integrates industry technologists and thought leaders specialized in vertical micro-segments. These teams work with specialized partners to develop industry-specific products and services that enable clients to improve productivity, increase operational excellence and accelerate innovation.\nIntuitive Operations and Automation\nOur Intuitive Operations and Automation practice helps clients build and run modern operations through two main vehicles: AI-led automation, which includes advisory and process and IT automation solutions designed to simplify and accelerate automation adoption, and business process outsourcing services, which help deliver business outcomes including revenue growth, increased customer and employee satisfaction and cost savings.\n\nDigital Experience Services (Cognizant Moment)\nEstablished in 2024, Cognizant Moment is our digital experience practice, designed to help clients leverage the power of AI to reimagine customer experiences and engineer innovative strategies aimed at driving growth. Cognizant Moment delivers intelligent ecosystem orchestration, connecting experiences as well as their underlying data, technology and operations across the entire enterprise. This approach enables clients to leverage generative AI's content generation capabilities alongside human ingenuity to innovate and differentiate by informing and automating processes, and creating dynamic, hyper-personalized experiences for their customers.\nGlobal Delivery Model\nWe operate in an integrated global delivery model, with delivery centers worldwide to provide our full range of services to our clients. Our model leverages methodologies, tools, AI and other enablers to optimize delivery by enhancing people's capabilities through technology. We continue to modernize our delivery operations through lean processes, increased automation and integrated, AI-infused systems. Our employees are deployed at client sites, local or in-country delivery centers, regional delivery centers and offshore delivery centers, as required to best serve our clients. Our extensive facilities, technology and communications infrastructure are designed to enable the effective collaboration of our global workforce across locations and geographies.\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive, characterized by a large number of participants and subject to rapid change. Competitors may include systems integration firms, contract programming companies, application software companies, cloud computing service providers, traditional consulting firms, professional services groups of computer equipment companies, infrastructure management companies, outsourcing companies, boutique digital companies and clients' in-house technology resources, such as GCCs.

  "item7_clean": "A predominant portion of our costs in India are denominated in the Indian rupee, representing approximately 24% of our global operating costs during\nThese costs are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which have an impact on our results of operations. We enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. Including the impact of the hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee positively impacted our operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 by 44 basis points as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nExcluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 25 basis points in 2024. Each additional 1.0% change in exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 18 basis points (excluding the impact of our cash flow hedges). In 2024, the settlement of our cash flow hedges positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 6 basis points, compared to a negative impact of 13 basis points in 2023.\nSegment Operating Profit\nSegment operating profit and operating margin percentage were as follows:\nSegment operating profit\nSegment operating margin\nIn 2024, segment operating margins across all our segments were negatively impacted by increased compensation costs, partially offset by savings generated from our NextGen program and the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Segment operating profit in the Health Sciences and Communications, Media and Technology segments was negatively impacted by resales of third-party products in connection with our integrated offerings strategy and higher costs typical to the initial phases of several recently won large deals. Segment operating profit in the Products and Resources segment was negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of the Belcan acquisition. Segment operating profit in the Financial Services segment was positively impacted by reduced resales of third-party products in connection with our integrated offerings strategy.\nTotal segment operating profit was as follows for the year ended December 31:\n(Dollars in millions)\nIncrease / (Decrease)\nTotal segment operating profit\nLess: unallocated costs\nIncome from operations\nThe decrease in unallocated costs for 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily driven by lower corporate expenses as well as lower NextGen charges of $134 million in 2024 as compared to $229 million in 2023 (see\nto our consolidated financial statements).\n\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCognizant is one of the world’s leading professional services companies, engineering modern businesses and delivering strategic outcomes for our clients. We help clients modernize technology, reimagine processes and transform experiences so they can stay ahead in today's fast-changing world, where AI is beginning to reshape organizations in every field. We provide industry expertise and close client collaboration, combining critical perspective with a flexible engagement style. We tailor our services and solutions to specific industries with an integrated global delivery model that employs client service and delivery teams based at client locations and dedicated global and regional delivery centers. Our collaborative services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, quality engineering and assurance, engineering research and development, application maintenance, infrastructure and security as well as business process services and automation. Digital, AI-enhanced services continue to be an important part of our portfolio, aligning with our clients' focus on becoming data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses.\nAt the end of 2024, we completed our NextGen program, which was aimed at simplifying our operating model, optimizing corporate functions and consolidating and realigning office space to reflect the post-pandemic hybrid work environment. The savings generated by the program are funding continued investments in our people, revenue growth opportunities and the modernization of our office space. In 2024, we incurred $134 million of employee separation, facility exit and other costs related to the program, bringing the total costs incurred since inception to $363 million. See\nto our consolidated financial statements.\n2024 Financial Results\nIncome from Operations\nGAAP\nGAAP\nGAAP\nRevenue up $383 million or 2.0% from 2023; an increase of 1.9% in constant currency\nIncome from Operations up $203 million or 7.5% from 2023\nAdjusted Income from Operations\nup $108 million or 3.7% from 2023\nOperating margin up 80 basis points from 2023\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nup 20 basis points from 2023\nDiluted EPS up $0.30 or 7.1% from 2023\nAdjusted Diluted EPS\nup $0.20 or 4.4% from 2023\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, revenues increased by $383 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of 2.0%, or 1.9% on a constant currency basis\n. Our recently completed acquisitions contributed 200 basis points to revenue growth. Additionally, revenues were positively impacted by growth in our Health Sciences segment, partially offset by weakness primarily in our Products and Resources (excluding the impact of our recently completed acquisitions) and Financial Services segments.\nAdjusted Income From Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS and constant currency revenue growth are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nOur cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, project-related immigration and travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and costs of third-party products and services relating to revenues. The increase, as a percentage of revenues, was due to higher compensation costs, primarily as a result of a merit increase cycle, and the resale of third-party products in connection with our integrated offerings strategy, partially offset by the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements and operational efficiencies.\nSG&A Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense)\nSG&A expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, immigration, travel, marketing, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. The decrease, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily driven by the net savings generated from our NextGen program, partially offset by the impact of recently completed acquisitions, primarily as a result of transaction and integration related expenses.\n$29M\n0.5% as a % of revenues\n\nOur operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin\nincreased to 14.7% and 15.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024, from 13.9% and 15.1%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our 2024 GAAP and Adjusted Operating Margins were positively impacted by net savings generated from our NextGen program and the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements, while being negatively impacted by increased compensation costs, primarily as a result of a merit increase cycle completed during the third quarter of 2024, and the dilutive impact of recently completed acquisitions, primarily driven by transaction and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles. In addition, our GAAP operating margins for 2024 and 2023, were negatively impacted by the NextGen charges, as discussed in\nto our consolidated financial statements, which were excluded from our Adjusted Operating Margin.\nAs a global professional services company, we compete on the basis of the knowledge, experience, insights, skills and talent of our employees and the value they can provide to our clients. We closely monitor attrition trends focusing on the metric that we believe is most relevant to our business. For the year ended December 31, 2024 our Voluntary Attrition - Tech Services was 15.9% as compared to 13.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023. We finished 2024 with approximately 336,800 employees as compared to 347,700 employees at the end of 2023.\nSee \"Overview\" within\nPart I, Item 1. Business\nfor information on our strategic approach.\nWe continue to expect the focus of our clients to be on their transformation into AI-ready, technology-driven, data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. To support this transformation and drive greater business resiliency, we expect clients will continue to\ndemand services and solutions that can enhance productivity and deliver cost savings.\nWe believe clients will continue to contend with industry-specific changes driven by evolving digital technologies, uncertainty in the regulatory environment, industry consolidation and convergence as well as international trade policie\ns and other macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the uncertainty related to the global economy, which has affected and may continue to affect their demand for our services.\nWe increasingly use AI-based technologies, including GenAI, in our client offerings and our own internal operations. AI technologies and services are part of a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. We plan to make significant investments in our AI capabilities to meet the needs of our clients and harness AI's value in a flexible, secure, scalable and responsible way. As AI-based technologies or other forms of automation evolve, we expect that demand for some services that we currently perform for our clients may be reduced and our ability to obtain favorable pricing or other terms for our services may be diminished.\nPotential tax law and other regulatory changes, including possible U.S. corporate income tax reform and the Code on Social Security, 2020 in India, among other items, may impact our future results.\nWe expect that the Code on Social Security, 2020, if enacted as currently written, could result in a material one-time increase to our post-employment liability for past service and would also modestly increase our costs for employment and post-employment benefits prospectively.\nIn addition, in March 2024, India and Mauritius signed a Protocol to amend the India-Mauritius Income Tax Treaty. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the amendment, which, depending on its final terms when entered into force, could increase our effective income tax rate, as CTS India is a subsidiary of our wholly-owned Mauritius entity. For additional information, see\nPart I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we completed the acquisition of Belcan. See\nto our consolidated financial statements. This acquisition is expected to have a modest near-term dilutive impact to our 2025 operating margin, primarily due to integration-related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles.\nAdjusted Operating Margin is not a measurement of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges consist of costs related to the NextGen program. Restructuring charges were $134 million or 0.7%, as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $229 million or 1.2%, as a percentage of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2023. For further detail on our restructuring charges see\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by 1.9%, and was flat as a percentage of revenues, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase in amortization expense driven by intangible assets related to our recently completed acquisitions was partially offset by the decline of depreciation expense, which was driven by actions taken under our NextGen program.\nOperating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin\nThe increase in our 2024 GAAP operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin\nwas primarily driven by net savings generated from our NextGen program and the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements, partially offset by increased compensation costs, primarily as a result of a merit increase cycle, and the dilutive impact of recently completed acquisitions, primarily as a result of transaction and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles. In addition, our 2024 and 2023 GAAP operating margins were negatively impacted by the NextGen charges, as discussed in\nto our consolidated financial statements, which were excluded from our Adjusted Operating Margin\n\nPortions of our disclosure include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures set forth below should be carefully evaluated.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Income from Operations exclude unusual items, such as NextGen charges. Our non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Diluted EPS excludes unusual items, such as NextGen charges, and net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax impact of all the applicable adjustments. For further detail on the NextGen charges, see\nto our consolidated financial statements. The income tax impact of each item excluded from Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred. Constant currency revenue growth is defined as revenues for a given period restated at the comparative period’s foreign currency exchange rates measured against the comparative period's reported revenues. Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities net of purchases of property and equipment.\nWe believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the Company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results. For internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use various GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, to determine portions of the compensation for executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. We believe that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain costs, read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure, as applicable, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\nA limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial measures may exclude costs that are recurring such as net non-operating foreign currency exch",
