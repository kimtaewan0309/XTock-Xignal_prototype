The following table summarizes information for our reportable segments for the three months ended September 30, 2025 (dollars in thousands):\nAdjusted NOI by Reportable Segment\nCCRC\n_______________________________________\nOur Adjusted NOI for our reportable segments, which we also refer to as Total Portfolio Adjusted NOI for our reportable segments, includes results of operations from disposed properties through the disposition date. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of Adjusted NOI by reportable segment to income (loss) before income taxes and equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures. See our Segment Analysis below for additional information.\nFor a description of our significant activities during 2025, see “Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Company Highlights” in this report.\nOur strategy is to own, operate, and develop high-quality real estate focused on healthcare discovery and delivery. We manage our real estate portfolio for the long-term to maximize risk-adjusted returns and support the growth of our dividends. Our strategy consists of four core elements:\n: Our portfolio consists of high-quality properties in desirable locations. Our portfolio is focused on outpatient medical and lab buildings, favorable sectors that benefit from the universal desire for improved health. We have built scale and fostered deep industry relationships, two unique factors that provide us with a competitive advantage.\n: We maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet with ample liquidity as well as long-term fixed-rate debt financing with staggered maturities to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk.\n: We work with leading pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies, as well as healthcare delivery systems, specialty physician groups, and other healthcare service providers, to meet their real estate needs. We provide high-quality property management services to encourage tenants to renew, expand, and relocate into our properties, which drives increased occupancy, rental rates, and property values.\n: We have a people-first culture that we believe attracts, develops, and retains top talent. We continually strive to create and maintain an industry-leading platform, with systems and tools that allow us to effectively and efficiently manage our assets and investment activity.\nMarket Trends and Uncertainties\nOur operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by global and national economic and market conditions generally and by the local economic conditions where our properties are located.\nHigher interest rates and uncertainty in public and private equity and fixed income markets have led to increased costs and limitations on the availability of capital. In addition, higher interest rates have and could continue to adversely impact our borrowing costs, the fair value of our fixed rate instruments, transaction volume, and real estate values generally, including our real estate. We have also been affected by increased costs relating to tenant improvements and construction, which, together with higher costs of capital and tariff actions (or potential tariff actions), have adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, construction starts and the expected yields on our capital projects, including our developments and redevelopments.\nWe continuously monitor the effects of domestic and global events on our operations and financial position, and on the operations and financial position of our tenants, operators, and borrowers, to enable us to remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic changes in our operating environment. These events include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which could negatively impact our business: inflation; recession; interest rates; challenges in the financial markets; availability of private capital and funding in the life science industry; and actions by the U.S. political administration and regulatory agencies that affect healthcare policy, life science research and innovation, labor supply, procurement and construction costs, and general economic conditions (such as budget reconciliation actions, tariff actions, changes in healthcare regulation, decreases in government funding and staffing, and immigration reform).\nTo the extent our tenants and/or operators have experienced, or will experience, increased costs, liquidity constraints, and financing difficulties due to the foregoing macroeconomic and market conditions, they may be unable or unwilling to make payments or perform their obligations when due.\nReal Estate Transactions\nIn February 2025, we acquired: (i) a lab land parcel in Cambridge, Massachusetts for $20 million and (ii) a portfolio of three outpatient medical buildings in New York for $17 million.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2025, we sold one outpatient medical land parcel for $4 million.\nIn September 2025, we acquired a condominium interest in eight suites within an outpatient medical building in Atlanta, Georgia for $6 million.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2025, we sold two outpatient medical buildings for $27 million.\nDevelopment and Redevelopment Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the following projects were placed in service: (i) a portion of two outpatient medical development projects with total project costs of $32 million, (ii) two lab development buildings held in our unconsolidated Callan Ridge JV of which our share of total project costs was $63 million, (iii) one outpatient medical development project with total project costs of $38 million, (iv) a portion of one lab development project with total project costs of $36 million, (v) two lab redevelopment buildings held in our unconsolidated South San Francisco JVs of which our share of total project costs was $26 million, (vi) one outpatient medical redevelopment project with total project costs of $12 million, and (vii) two lab redevelopment projects with total project costs of $7 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn February 2025, we repaid $348 million aggregate principal amount of 3.40% senior unsecured notes at maturity.\nIn February 2025, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.38% senior unsecured notes due 2035.\nIn June 2025, we repaid $452 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured notes at maturity.\nIn August 2025, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due 2033.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased 5.09 million shares of our common stock under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program (as defined below) at a weighted average price of $18.50 per share for a total of $94 million.\nIn February 2025, we made a preferred equity investment in a joint venture that holds a lab campus under development in San Diego, California (the “HQ Point Preferred Equity Investment”). This investment is entitled to a preferred return, and we have committed to fund up to a total investment of $50 million. As of September 30, 2025, we have funded $45 million of our total commitment.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we (i) entered into secured loans with an aggregate principal balance of $120 million, $36 million of which was funded upon closing of the loans, and (ii) entered into and funded one $4 million mezzanine loan to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we entered into two outpatient medical development joint ventures.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we received full repayment of: (i) two seller financing loans receivable secured by senior housing assets with an aggregate principal balance of $106 million and (ii) the $15 million outstanding balance of one secured loan.\nThe following table summarizes our common stock cash dividends declared in 2025:\nDividend Payment Date\n_______________________________________\nOur Board of Directors declares our common stock cash dividends on a quarterly basis. Commencing in April 2025, our Board of Directors transitioned from paying the common stock cash dividend on a quarterly basis to a monthly basis.\nResults of Operations\nWe evaluate our business and allocate resources among our operating segments: (i) outpatient medical, (ii) lab, (iii) CCRC, (iv) an interest in our unconsolidated SWF SH JV, (v) loans receivable, and (vi) a preferred equity investment.
