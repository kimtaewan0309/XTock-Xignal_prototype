  "item1_clean": "Our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business. Similar to the majority of the lodging industry, we further categorize business within these broad groups based on characteristics they have in common as follows:\nTransient business broadly represents individual business and/or leisure travelers. Our hotels attract both business and leisure travelers; therefore, our hotels' performance as it relates to transient demand is driven by trends related to both of these customer types. The four key subcategories of rates offered to the transient business group are:\nThis is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the public. It typically is the rate charged to travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discounted rates. It includes the “rack rate,” which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available. Retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels (e.g., seasonality and weekday vs. weekend stays).\nNon-Qualified Discount:\nThis category includes special rates offered by the hotels, including packages, advance-purchase discounts and promotional offers. It also includes rooms booked through online travel agencies (OTAs).\n: This is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally. These rates typically are negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate. In addition, this category includes rates offered at the prevailing per diem for approved government travel.\n: This category encompasses all discount programs, such as AAA and AARP discounts, rooms booked through wholesale channels, frequent guest program redemptions, and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel.\nGroup business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together, usually with a minimum of 10 rooms. The three key sub-categories of the group business category are:\n: group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions.\n: group business related to corporate meetings (e.g., product launches, training programs, contract negotiations, and presentations).\n: group business predominately related to social, military, education, religious, fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams, otherwise known as SMERF business.\nContract business refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period at significantly discounted rates. Airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our airport hotels. Contract rates may be utilized by hotels that are in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand.\nManagers and Operational Agreements\nAll our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements, with some of such hotels also subject to separate franchise or license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operations under the designated brand. Under these agreements, the managers have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the day-to-day operation of the hotels, including establishing room rates, securing and processing reservations, procuring inventories, supplies and services, providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers’ technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels. The managers employ all managerial and other employees for the hotels, review hotel operations with a focus on improving revenues and managing expenses, review the maintenance of the hotels, prepare reports, budgets and projections, and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels. These support services include planning and policy services, divisional financial services, product planning and development, employee staffing and training, corporate executive management and certain in-house legal services. We have certain approval rights over budgets, capital expenditures, significant leases and contractual commitments, and various other matters.\nGeneral Terms and Provisions\n– Agreements governing our hotels that are managed by brand owners (Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, Four Seasons, 1 Hotels and AccorHotels) typically include the terms described below:\nTerm and fees for operational services\n. The initial term of our management and operating agreements generally is 10 to 25 years, with one or more renewal terms at the option of the manager. The majority of our management agreements condition the manager’s right to exercise options for specified renewal terms upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria. The manager typically receives compensation in the form of a base management fee, which is calculated as a percentage (generally 2-3%) of annual gross revenues, and an incentive management fee, which typically is calculated as a percentage (generally 10-20%) of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment in the hotel. In the case of our hotels operating under the W\nbrands and managed by Marriott following its acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. on September 23, 2016 (collectively, the “Starwood Hotels”), the base management fee is only 1% of annual gross revenues, but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable under a separate license agreement (as described below).\n. In the case of the Starwood Hotels, operations are governed by separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to the designated brand, including rights to use trademarks, service marks and logos, matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies, and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services. Although the term of these license agreements generally is coterminous with the corresponding operating agreements, the license agreements contemplate the potential for continued brand affiliation even in the event of a termination of the operating agreement (for instance, in the event the hotel is operated by an independent operator). Licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees (generally 5% of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2% of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales), which amounts supplement the lower base management fee of 1% of gross revenues received by Marriott under the operating agreements, as noted above.\nChain or system programs and services\n. Managers are required to provide chain or system programs and services generally that are furnished on a centralized basis. Such services include the development and operation of certain computer systems and reservation services, regional or other centralized management and administrative services, marketing and sales programs and services, training and other personnel services, and other centralized or regional services as may be determined to be more efficiently performed on a centralized, regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis. Costs and expenses incurred in providing these chain or system programs and services generally are allocated on a cost reimbursement basis among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates or that otherwise benefit from these services.\nWorking capital and fixed asset supplies\n. We are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies (for example, linen, china, glassware, silver and uniforms). We also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the\nfunds available from working capital are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels. For certain hotels, the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by the managers for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis, with managers being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the management or operating agreements.\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment replacements\n. We are required to provide the managers with all furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FF&E”) necessary for the operation of the hotels (including funding any required FF&E replacements). On an annual basis, the managers prepare budgets for FF&E to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the necessary funds, which budgets are subject to our review and approval. For purposes of funding such expenditures, a specified percentage (typically 4-5%) of the gross revenues of each hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow or reserve account in our name, to which the manager has access. For certain hotels, we have negotiated flexibility with the manager that reduces the funding commitment required as follows:\nFor certain of our Marriott-managed hotels, we have entered into an agreement with Marriott to allow for such expenditures to be funded from one pooled reserve account, rather than periodic reserve fund contributions being deposited into separate reserve accounts at each of the subject hotels, with the minimum required balance maintained on an ongoing basis in that pooled reserve account being significantly less than the amount that would have been maintained otherwise in such separate hotel reserve accounts. Upon sale, a hotel-level reserve account would be funded (either by the purchaser or by us, as the seller) in the full amount of the reserve balance associated with the subject hotel.\nFor certain of the Starwood Hotels, periodic reserve fund contributions, which otherwise would be deposited into reserve accounts maintained by managers at each hotel, are distributed to us and we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which otherwise would be funded from reserve accounts for each of the subject hotels. Upon sale, a hotel-level reserve account would be funded in the amount of the subject hotel’s pro rata share, if any, of the consolidated pooled reserve balance.\nBuilding alterations, improvements and renewals\n. The managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals and replacements to the structural, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and elevators of each hotel, along with alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required, in the manager’s reasonable judgment, to keep the hotel in a competitive, efficient and economical operating condition that is consistent with brand standards. We generally have approval rights over such budgets and expenditures, which we review and approve based on our manager’s recommendations and on our judgment. Expenditures for these major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building typically are funded directly by owners, although our agreements with Marriott in respect of the Starwood Hotels contemplate that certain such expenditures also may be funded from the FF&E reserve account.\nTreatment of additional owner funding\n. As additional owner funding becomes necessary, either for expenditures generally funded from the FF&E replacement funds, or for any major repairs or improvements to the hotel building which may be required to be funded directly by owners, most of our agreements provide for an economic benefit to us through an impact on the calculation of incentive management fees payable to our managers. One approach frequently utilized at some of our Marriott-managed hotels (excluding the Starwood Hotels) is to provide such owner funding through loans which are repaid, with interest, from operational revenues, with the repayment amounts reducing operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees. Another approach that is used at the Starwood Hotels, as well as wi",
  "item7_clean": "EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share and comparable hotel operating results (including hotel revenues and hotel EBITDA and margins) are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” for more information on these measures, including why we believe these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally, comparable hotel results and statistics are based on 78 comparable hotels as of December 31, 2024 and include adjustments for non-comparable hotels, dispositions and acquisitions. See \"Comparable Hotel RevPAR Overview\" for results of the portfolio based on our ownership period, without these adjustments.\nTotal revenues increased $373 million, or 7.0%, compared to 2023, benefiting from the 2024 acquisitions of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown, 1 Hotel Central Park and The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay and also the results of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed in the first half of 2023 as a result of Hurricane Ian. However, this was partially offset by the closure of The Don CeSar for the fourth quarter of 2024 following the impacts of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. In addition, continued growth in group business, building on its recovery in 2023, drove improvements in food and beverage revenues. Comparable hotel RevPAR increased 0.9%, compared to 2023, due to an increase in average room rates, as occupancy remained flat, reflecting continued strong group demand, tempered by continued imbalance in outbound travel from the U.S. compared to international inbound travel and the slow recovery in Maui following the August 2023 wildfires. In 2024, performance at our Maui hotels impacted comparable hotel RevPAR by approximately 160 basis points for the full year.\nComparable hotel Total RevPAR increased 2.1% for the year due primarily to improvements in food and beverage revenues driven by the strength in group business, as well as strong spa and other ancillary revenues. The growth was led by our Denver, Nashville and Northern Virginia markets with increases of 13.2%, 12.9% and 10.3%, respectively, compared to 2023, through a combination of rate and occupancy growth, driven by strong group demand. Our hotels in Jacksonville and New Orleans also outperformed our portfolio with comparable hotel Total RevPAR increases of 7.2% and 7.1%, respectively. These strong performances were offset by comparable hotel Total RevPAR declines at our Atlanta and San Francisco/San Jose markets of 9.4% and 5.3%, respectively. The declines were driven primarily by a decrease in business travel and short-term transient demand, with Atlanta also affected by disruption from renovations. In addition, comparable hotel Total RevPAR at our Maui market declined by 11.0% due to the continuing impacts of the August 2023 Maui wildfires (see “Statement of Operations Results and Trends”).\nAs expected, we faced higher wages and inflationary pressures compared to 2023. This, coupled with Maui performance, led to an operating profit margin (calculated based on GAAP operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenues) decline of 20 basis points to 15.4% in 2024, compared to 15.6% in 2023, despite an increase in net gains on insurance settlements. Operating profit margins under GAAP are also significantly affected by several items, including acquisitions, dispositions, depreciation expense and corporate expenses. Our comparable hotel EBITDA margins, which exclude these items, declined 60 basis points to 29.2% for the year, down from 29.8% in 2023 due to the trends discussed above.\nNet Income, Adjusted EBITDA\nand Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share\nNet income for Host Inc. was $707 million, a decrease of $45 million, or 6.0%, from the prior year, reflecting the decrease in gains on asset sales of $71 million and an increase in interest expense of $24 million, partially offset by an increase in net gains on insurance settlements of $24 million. These results led to a 4.8% decrease in diluted earnings per common share for Host Inc. to $0.99. Adjusted EBITDA\nwhich excludes gain on sale of assets and interest expense, among other items, increased 1.7% to $1,656 million as a result of operations from our acquisitions and the resumption of\noperations at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed during the first half of 2023, despite a $43 million decrease in business interruption gains. Adjusted FFO per diluted share increased 2.6% to $1.97 in 2024, reflecting the increase in Adjusted EBITDA\nas well as the impact of share repurchases in 2024 and 2023.\nThe trends and transactions described above for Host Inc. affected similarly the operating results for Host L.P., as the only significant difference between the Host Inc. and Host L.P. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the unaffiliated limited partners of Host L.P.\nThroughout 2024, group business at our properties continued to improve and group revenue on the books remains strong for 2025. Average rates remained elevated at our resorts compared to pre-pandemic levels, although they have moderated from post-pandemic highs. However, further growth has been hampered by the slow recovery from the wildfires in Maui, one of our largest markets by revenues, and the slower post-pandemic recovery of the San Francisco market. These trends are expected to continue into 2025.\nOn the macroeconomic front, the U.S. economy remained resilient during 2024 with real U.S. GDP growth of 2.8%, as unemployment remained at low levels and business investment grew at a robust 3.7%. U.S. lodging demand is correlated to changes in gross domestic product (GDP) and business investment, although the recovery of the industry post-pandemic has lagged that of the economy. Inflation moderated substantially during the year but remains a concern for 2025, with fewer rate cuts expected in the coming year. In addition, the new administration has brought heightened uncertainty due to anticipated changes to trade policy, tax policy and government spending. Other risks to economic growth remain, including geopolitical instability throughout the globe, high interest rates and volatile oil prices. As a result, leading indicators point toward slower economic growth in 2025. As of February 2025, Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus projects real U.S. GDP growth of 2.2%, reflecting a deceleration from 2024. Business investment growth is also anticipated to slow over the coming year, averaging 2.3%, down from 3.7% in 2024.\nHotel supply growth is anticipated to remain below the historical average, although we expect to see above-average growth in a few markets where our hotels are located, such as Nashville and Austin. Supply chain challenges have resulted in project delays across the U.S., and a tight lending environment has created construction financing challenges for future projects. We anticipate that the construction pipeline will remain modest until macroeconomic uncertainty moderates and interest rates decline further.\nBased on the trends noted, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR growth for the full year 2025 will be between 0.5% and 2.5%. In addition, we expect margins to decline in comparison to 2024, driven by higher wages and benefits, including increases driven by new union contracts in certain cities, as well as growth in insurance and real estate taxes.\nAs discussed above, the current outlook for the lodging industry remains uncertain, reflecting varying analyst assumptions surrounding the impact of higher interest rates, inflation, the recovery in Maui and escalating geopolitical conflicts. Therefore, there can be no assurances as to lodging demand performance for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, the slow recovery in Maui or deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. For more information on the risks that can affect our future results, see\nStrategic Initiatives\nFor 2025, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation to strengthen our portfolio and to deliver stockholder value through multiple levers, which may include, over time, acquiring hotels or investing in our portfolio. We intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to acquire upper-upscale and luxury properties, through single asset or portfolio acquisitions, that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive long-term value to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise. At the same time, we will opportunistically sell hotels when market conditions permit. We also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to seek to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate for its highest and best use.\nDuring 2024, we completed the following acquisitions:\nthe 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for $530 million;\nthe 234-room 1 Hotel Central Park for $265 million; and\nthe 450-room Turtle Bay Resort, including a 49-acre land parcel entitled for development, for a total purchase price of $680 million, which is net of $45 million in key money received from Marriott International as part of an agreement to transition management to Marriott and convert the property to The Ritz-Carlton brand. The property has been renamed The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay.\nWe continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements, including projects that are designed to increase the eco-efficiency of our hotels, incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology. During 2024, we spent approximately $548 million on capital expenditures, of which $260 million represented return on investment (“ROI”) capital expenditures, $252 million represented renewal and replacement projects and $36 million was for hurricane restoration work. This included completing the final steps of our restoration efforts following Hurricane Ian of bringing the permanent central energy plant online at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. For all properties impacted by Hurricane Ian, we estimate the total property reconstruction and remediation costs, including significant enhancements, was approximately $315 million, of which approximately 30% related to remediation costs. In 2024, we reached a final settlement with our insurance providers on covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian, which totaled $308 million. In total, $99 million of the insurance receipts were recognized as a gain on business interruption. Another major capital project completed during the year was the repositioning renovations at The Singer Oceanfront Resort, Curio Collection by Hilton, including rooms, public space, and food and beverage outlets.\nIn addition, hotels within certain regions are subject to environmental and weather-related events, including hurricanes, wildfires, floods, rising sea levels, mudslides, earthquakes, and other natural perils. To mitigate some of these physical risks, we execute capital expenditure projects, including replacements and restorations of exterior walls, doors and windows, roofs, grounds, relocated/elevated critical equipment and distributed energy systems to further increase the resilience of our hotels. A portion of our capital expenditures for 2024 include these types of projects, which we expect to continue in future years. While the number of projects and overall cost varies from year to year, on average approximately 6% our capital expenditures have related to these types of projects over the past six years. The enhanced resilience projects implemented during the reconstruction of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples were successful in minimizing damage to the resort during the two hurricanes that made landfall in 2024; however, no assurances can be made as to whether these enhanced resiliency projects will be successful in mitigating the damage from future environmental and weather-related events, especially as the frequency and severity of these events are expected to increase over time.\nIn collaboration with Hyatt, we initiated a transformational capital program in 2023 at six properties in our portfolio, the Grand Hyatt Atlanta in Buckhead, Grand Hyatt Washington, Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego, Hyatt Regency Austin, Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill, and Hyatt Regency Reston. These investments are intended to position the targeted hotels to compete better in their respective markets while seeking to enhance long-term performance. During 2024, we spent approximately $155 million on this program, which is included in ROI capital projects. The total investment is expected to be approximately $550 million to $600 million, two-thirds of which we were planning to invest as part of our capital plan over the next few years. We expect to invest between $125 million and $200 million per year on this program. Hyatt has agreed to provide additional priority returns on the agreed upon investments and operating profit guarantees totaling $40 million to offset expected business disruptions. We received approximately $9 million of the operating profit guarantees in 2024 from Hyatt and expect to receive approximately $27 million in 2025.\nFor 2025, we expect total capital expenditures of $580 million to $670 million, consisting of ROI projects of approximately $270 million to $315 million, renewal and replacement expenditures of $240 million to $275 million, and $70 million to $80 million for the restoration work from the damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The ROI projects include approximately $170 million to $180 million for the Hyatt transformational capital program.\nAlso in 2023, we announced and broke ground on a project to develop and sell 40 fee-simple condominiums on a five-acre development parcel to be Four Seasons-branded and managed residences at the Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World\nResort. Construction of the mid-rise building is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025 and the villas are expected to complete in the first half of 2026. In 2024, we spent $64 million in development costs for this project and began marketing the units, resulting in buyer commitments for nearly one-third of the units. For 2025, the development costs for this project are expected to be $75 million to $85 million.\nFinancing transactions\nOn April 1, 2024, we repaid $400 million of 3⅞% Series G senior notes at maturity.\nOn May 10, 2024, we issued $600 million of 5.700% Series K senior notes for proceeds of $584 million, net of original issue discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay all\noutstanding amounts then outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility. The Series K senior notes have been designated as green bonds, and an amount equal to the net proceeds was allocated to finance and/or refinance one or more eligible green projects.\nOn August 12, 2024, we issued $700 million of 5.500% Series L senior notes for proceeds of $683 million, net of\noriginal issue discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The net proceeds from this issuance were used in part to repay all $525 million of borrowings then outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility, including amounts borrowed in connection with the acquisitions of The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay and 1 Hotel Central Park.\nWe believe that our ability to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and well-laddered maturity schedule is an important factor in our investment strategy. As of December 31, 2024, we have a debt balance of $5.1 billion, our weighted average interest rate is 4.7%, and our weighted average debt maturity is 5.2 years.\nFor",
