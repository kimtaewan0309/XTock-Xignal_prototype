Other revenue included royalties and share of profits earned in connection with license agreements of $165.4 million and $90.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $353.0 million and $207.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n(In millions, except headcount data)\nResearch and development\nAcquired in-process research and development\nSelling, general, and administrative\nCost of collaboration and contract manufacturing\nOther operating (income) expense, net\nTotal operating expenses\nIncludes costs incurred net of any cost reimbursements from collaborators\nIncludes costs incurred in connection with manufacturing drug supplies for collaborators and others\nOperating expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $237.0 million and $225.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $744.4 million and $678.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table summarizes our direct research and development expenses by clinical development program and other significant categories of research and development expenses. Direct research and development expenses are comprised primarily of costs paid to third parties for clinical and product development activities, including costs related to preclinical research activities, clinical trials, and the portion of research and development expenses incurred by our collaborators that we are obligated to reimburse. Indirect research and development expenses have not been allocated directly to each program, and primarily consist of costs to compensate personnel, overhead and infrastructure costs to maintain our facilities, and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects. Clinical manufacturing costs primarily consist of costs to manufacture bulk drug product for clinical development purposes as well as related drug filling, packaging, and labeling costs. Clinical manufacturing costs also include pre-launch commercial supplies which did not meet the criteria to be capitalized as inventory. The table below also includes reimbursements of research and development expenses by collaborators, as when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of such expenses that we incur under a collaboration, we record those reimbursable amounts in the period in which such costs are incurred.\nDirect research and development expenses:\nOrdspono (odronextamab)\nLynozyfic (linvoseltamab)\nDupixent (dupilumab)\nEYLEA HD (aflibercept) 8 mg\nLibtayo (cemiplimab)\nOther product candidates in clinical development and other research programs\nTotal direct research and development expenses\nIndirect research and development expenses:\nPayroll and benefits\nLab supplies and other research and development costs\nOccupancy and other operating costs\nTotal indirect research and development expenses\nClinical manufacturing costs\nReimbursement of research and development expenses by collaborators\nTotal research and development expenses\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation\nResearch and development expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $125.1 million and $123.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $405.1 million and $369.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nThere are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development, uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties described in Part II, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors.\" There is also variability in the duration and costs necessary to develop a product candidate, potential opportunities and/or uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, and the estimated cost and scope of the projects. The lengthy process of seeking FDA and other applicable approvals, and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business. We are unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates in clinical development will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows.\nAcquired In-process Research and Development (\"IPR&D\") Expenses\nAcquired IPR&D expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 included an $80.0 million up-front payment in connection with our license agreement with Hansoh Pharmaceuticals Group Company Limited.\nAcquired IPR&D expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a $45.0 million development milestone in connection with our collaboration agreement with Sonoma Biotherapeutics, Inc.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024, primarily due to lower charitable contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization. Selling, general, and administrative expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $92.0 million and $83.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $279.0 million and $251.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n(In millions, except gross margin on net product sales)\nGross margin on net product sales\n\nPrograms in Clinical Development\nProduct candidates in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development, which are being developed by us and/or our collaborators, are summarized in the table below.\nThere are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development (including any post-approval studies), uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, changes to drug pricing and reimbursement regulations and requirements, and changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate. The planning, execution, and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results.\nRefer to Part II, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" for a description of risks and uncertainties that may affect our clinical programs. Any of such risks and uncertainties may, among other matters, negatively impact the development timelines set forth in the table below.\nEYLEA HD (aflibercept) 8 mg\n–RVO\n–RVO (U.S., EU, and Japan)\n–Every 4-week dosing "
