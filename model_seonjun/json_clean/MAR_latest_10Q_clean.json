Our development pipeline included over 250,000 rooms, or 42 percent, that were under construction or in the process of converting to our system at the end of the 2025 third quarter. Over half of the rooms in our quarter-end development pipeline are located outside U.S. & Canada.\nWe currently expect full year 2025 net rooms growth to approach 5 percent, including the rooms associated with the citizenM brand acquisition discussed in Note 2, which are not reflected in the property and room count or development pipeline discussed above.\nProperties and Rooms\nThe following table shows our properties and rooms by ownership type.\nvs. September 30, 2024\nvs. September 30, 2024\nFranchised/Licensed/Other\nIn addition to franchised, includes our timeshare properties, MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy, Design Hotels, and The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection.\nThe following tables present RevPAR, occupancy, and ADR statistics for comparable properties.

Also see the “Business Trends”\n\nOver the long term, our centralized programs and services are not designed to impact our economics, either positively or negatively.\nThe increase in cost reimbursements, net in the 2025 third quarter and 2025 first three quarters primarily reflected lower expenses related to our insurance program and higher Loyalty Program revenues, partially offset by higher expenses, net of revenues for many of our centralized programs and services.\nOther Operating Expenses\nChange 2025 vs. 2024\nChange 2025 vs. 2024\nDepreciation, amortization, and other\nGeneral, administrative, and other\nRestructuring and merger-related (recoveries) charges, and other\nGeneral, administrative, and other expenses decreased in the 2025 third quarter primarily due to lower guarantee reserves ($22 million). General, administrative, and other expenses decreased in the 2025 first three quarters primarily due to lower compensation costs ($32 million) and lower guarantee reserves ($21 million).\nRestructuring and merger-related (recoveries) charges, and other expenses changed in the 2025 third quarter and 2025 first three quarters primarily due to insurance recoveries related to the Data Security Incident discussed in Note 6.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense)\nChange 2025 vs. 2024\nChange 2025 vs. 2024\nGains and other income, net\nInterest expense increased in the 2025 third quarter and 2025 first three quarters primarily due to higher debt balances driven by Senior Notes issuances, net of maturities ($32 million and $100 million, respectively).\nChange 2025 vs. 2024\nChange 2025 vs. 2024\nProvision for income taxes\nProvision for income taxes increased in the 2025 third quarter primarily due to higher pre-tax income ($54 million).\nProvision for income taxes increased in the 2025 first three quarters primarily due to higher pre-tax income ($67 million) and a shift in earnings to jurisdictions with higher tax rates ($41 million), partially offset by the current year relea\ne of tax reserves ($91 million).\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nThe following discussion presents an analysis of the operating results of our reportable business segments for the 2025 third quarter compared to the 2024 third quarter and for the 2025 first three quarters compared to the 2024 first three quarters. Also see the “Business Trends” section above for further discussion.\nChange 2025 vs. 2024\nChange 2025 vs. 2024\nSegment net fee revenues\nEMEA\nSegment net fee revenues\nSegment net fee revenues\nAPEC\nSegment net fee revenues\nvs. September 30, 2024\nvs. September 30, 2024\nEMEA\nAPEC\nIn the 2025 first three quarters, segment net fee revenues grew in the U.S. & Canada, EMEA, and APEC, compared to 2024, primarily due to rooms growth and higher RevPAR (see the Lodging Statistics and Properties and Rooms tables above for more information).\nAdditionally, U.S. & Canada segment profits in the 2025 third quarter and 2025 first three quarters compared to the same periods in 2024 reflected higher cost reimbursement revenue, net of reimbursed expenses ($34 million and $28 million, respectively), higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses ($21 million and $24 million, respectively), and lower general, administrative, and other expenses ($19 million and $25 million, respectively). Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses increased primarily due to the inclusion of results from the Sheraton Grand Chicago hotel, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of the prior year. General, administrative, and other expenses decreased primarily due to lower guarantee reserves.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur long-term financial objectives include maintaining diversified financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. At the end of the 2025 third quarter, including the effect of interest rate swaps, our total long-term debt (current and noncurrent) had a weighted average interest rate of 4.6 percent, a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.6 years, and a ratio of fixed-rate to total long-term debt of 0.9 to 1.0.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe are party to a $4.5 billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement (as amended, the “Credit Facility”). Available borrowings under the Credit Facility support our commercial paper program and general corporate needs. U.S. dollar borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a spread based on our public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. We classify outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and outstanding commercial paper borrowings (which generally have short-term maturities of 45 days or less) as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis. The Credit Facility expires on December 14, 2027.\nThe Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4.5 to 1.0. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and liquidity needs.\nWe monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to fund our liquidity needs. We believe the Credit Facility, and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our liquidity requirements over the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nWe issue commercial paper in the U.S. Because we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. We do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and access to capital markets.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $694 million at September 30, 2025, an increase of $269 million from year-end 2024, primarily due to long-term debt issuances, net of repayments ($2,479 million), net cash provided by operating activities ($2,383 million), and issuances of common stock for our employee stock purchase\n, partially offset by share repurchases ($2,300 million), net commercial paper repayments ($960 million), dividends paid ($539 million), capital and technology expenditures ($432 million), the citizenM asset acquisition ($349 million), and financing outflows for employee stock-based compensation withholding taxes ($111 million).\nOur ratio of current assets to current liabilities was\n\nWe believe Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”), which we calculate by dividing property level room revenue by total rooms available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues, and should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (“ADR”), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance.
