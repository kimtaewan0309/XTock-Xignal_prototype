In addition to the two major business segments, Corporate and Other is also reported as a segment. For more detailed information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur fiscal quarterly periods are comprised of approximately 13 weeks, but the number of days per quarter may vary year-over-year. Our quarterly reporting periods usually end on the Saturday closest to the last day of March, June, and September. Our fourth quarter and fiscal year ends on December 31, regardless of the day of the week on which December 31 falls. For convenience, throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the 13-week periods comprising each fiscal quarter are denoted by the last day of the respective calendar quarter.\nWe sell our products and services through a combination of direct sales, distributors and company-owned stores. The demand for our products and services is seasonal and can be significantly impacted by the weather. Warmer than normal summer temperatures generate demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services, and colder than normal winter temperatures have a similar effect on heating products and services. Conversely, cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress the demand for HVACR products and services. In addition to weather, demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors, such as interest rates, the availability of financing, regional population and employment trends, new construction, general economic conditions, and consumer spending habits and confidence. A substantial portion of the sales in each of our business segments is attributable to replacement business, with the balance comprised of new construction business.\nThe principal elements of cost of goods sold are components, raw materials, factory overhead, labor, estimated costs of warranty expense, and freight and distribution costs. The principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, aluminum and copper. In recent years, pricing volatility for these commodities and related components has impacted us and the HVACR industry in general. We seek to mitigate the impact of certain commodity price volatility and tariffs through a combination of pricing actions, vendor contracts, improved production efficiency, and cost reduction initiatives. We also partially mitigate volatility in the prices of these commodities by entering into futures contracts and fixed forward contracts.\nResults for the third quarter of 2025 were mixed as our Home Comfort Solutions segment faced volume headwinds driven by market softness. Overall our net sales decreased 5% to $1.4 billion and our segment profit increased 2% to $310 million. For our Home Comfort Solutions segment, net sales decreased 12% and segment profit decreased $24 million. For our Building Climate Solutions segment, net sales increased 10% and segment profit increased $28 million. Segment loss decreased $2.4 million for our Corporate and Other segment.\nFinancial Highlights\nNet sales of $1,427 million in the third quarter of 2025 reflected a 5% decrease as compared to the same period in 2024.\nOperating income in the third quarter of 2025 increased $7 million to $310 million as favorable mix and price were partially offset by lower sales volumes, higher product costs, primarily related to inflationary pressures, including tariffs, and higher freight and distribution costs.\nNet income for the third quarter of 2025 was $246 million.\nDiluted earnings per share was $6.98 per share in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to $6.68 per share in the same period in 2024.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we returned $127 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $332 million of common stock through our share repurchase program.\nOn July 4, 2025, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” was signed into law, which includes significant changes to federal tax law and other regulatory provisions that may impact the Company. Based on an initial analysis of the relevant provisions, the impacts to our effective tax rate are immaterial, but several timing provisions are expected to result in material 2025 cash tax savings.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 - Consolidated Results\nThe following table provides a summary of our financial results, including information presented as a percentage of net sales:\n\n(Gains) losses and Other Expenses, Net\n(Gains) losses and other expenses, net for the third quarter of 2025 and 2024 included the following (in millions):\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\nForeign currency exchange (gains) losses\nLoss (gain) on disposal of fixed assets\nOther operating income\nNet change in unrealized losses (gains) on unsettled futures contracts\nEnvironmental liabilities and special litigation charges\n(Gains) losses and other expenses, net (pre-tax)\nIncome from Equity Method Investments\nInvestments over which we do not exercise control but have significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
