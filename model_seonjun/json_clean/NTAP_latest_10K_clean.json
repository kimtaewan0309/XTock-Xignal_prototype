If any of our key customers, resellers, or distributors changes its pricing practices, reduces the size or frequency of its orders, or stops purchasing our products altogether, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. Additionally, major customers may seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us, which could negatively impact our business, cash flow, and operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners, our revenues may be harmed.\nOur growth strategy relies on developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major third-party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and co-market them. Many of our strategic partners are industry leaders that provide us with expanded access to market segments where we do not directly participate. Strategic partnerships with public cloud providers and other cloud service vendors are particularly critical to the success of our cloud-based business.\nHowever, there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners, and these relationships may not be exclusive, may not generate significant revenues, and may be terminated on short notice. Some of our partners also collaborate with our competitors, which can increase the availability of competing solutions and hinder our ability to grow these relationships. Additionally, some partners, especially large and diversified technology companies, including major cloud providers, are also our competitors, complicating our relationships.\nIf we are unable to establish new or maintain current partnerships, if our strategic partners prioritize their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry, if our strategic partners seek to renegotiate or terminate our agreements, or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us, we could experience lower-than-expected revenues, delays in product development, and other adverse effects on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and periodically restructure our business, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nTo successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market, we need effective planning, forecasting, and management processes that allow us to scale and adjust our business in response to changing market opportunities and conditions.\nIn fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, we reorganized our sales resources, including changes and additions to our sales leadership team, to gain operational efficiencies and better align our resources with customer and market opportunities. However, such reorganization and ongoing adjustments to our go-to-market model could disrupt our sales cycles in the short- or long-term, may not yield the desired efficiencies and benefits, and could harm our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe have undertaken, and may in the future undertake, initiatives that include reorganizing our workforce, restructuring, discontinuing certain products, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, reducing facilities, or a combination of these actions, which could result in restructuring charges. Rapid changes in the size, alignment, or organization of our workforce, including our business unit structure, structure of our sales team, and sales account coverage, could impair our ability to develop, sell and deliver products and services as planned, or hinder our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives. Charges associated with these activities could harm our operating results.\nOur ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives depends on many estimates and assumptions, which are subject to uncertainties. If our estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nReduced U.S. government demand could materially harm our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe U.S. government is an important customer for us, but its demand is uncertain due to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints. Uncertainty related to the U.S. government budget and debt levels, changes to governmental agency structure, compliance with new initiatives and executive orders, and reductions in force have increased demand uncertainty for our products. Changes in administration may also lead to programs and initiatives moving in or out of favor, which may lead to varied perception of our company in the U.S. government market and may negatively impact our sales to the U.S. government. Additionally, the U.S. government, like other customers, may evaluate competing products and delay purchases during technology transitions in the storage\n\nProfessional Services\noffer specialized expertise to minimize risks and simplify designing, implementing, migrating, and integrating NetApp hybrid cloud solutions.

Our sales efforts are organized around the evolving needs of our current and targeted customers, and our marketing initiatives reflect this focus. NetApp uses a multichannel distribution strategy. We sell our products, solutions and services to end-user business customers and service providers through a direct sales force and an ecosystem of partners, including the leading cloud providers. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation, creating market awareness, communicating customer advantages and generating demand for our sales force and channel partners.\nOur diversified customer base spans industry segments and vertical markets such as energy, financial services, government, technology, internet, life sciences, healthcare services, manufacturing, media, entertainment, animation, video postproduction and telecommunications. NetApp focuses primarily on the enterprise storage and data management, cloud storage and cloud operations markets. We design our products to meet the evolving requirements of a hybrid, multicloud world, driven by digital transformation and cloud initiatives.\nOur partnerships with the industry’s leading cloud, infrastructure, consulting, application, and reseller partners are created with one goal in mind: the success of our customers. Global enterprises, local businesses, and government agencies look to NetApp and our ecosystem of partners to help maximize the business value of their IT and cloud investments.\nWe work with a wide range of partners for our customers, including technology partners, value-added resellers, system integrators, OEMs, service providers and distributors. During fiscal 2025, sales through our indirect channels represented 78% of our net revenues. Our global partner ecosystem is critical to NetApp’s growth and success. We are continually strengthening existing partnerships and investing in new ones to ensure we are meeting the evolving needs of our customers.\nAs of April 25, 2025, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 5,100 managers, sales representatives and technical support personnel. We have offices in approximately 26 countries. Sales to customers Arrow Electronics, Inc. and TD Synnex Corporation accounted for 21% and 24% of our net revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2025. Information about sales to and accounts receivables from our major customers, segment disclosures, foreign operations and net sales attributable to our geographic regions is included in Note 15 – Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\n\nTransition to consumption-based business models may adversely affect our revenues and profitability in other areas of our business, potentially harming our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe offer customers a variety of consumption models, including cloud-based storage services and storage as a service (STaaS) delivered on-premises. As these business models continue to evolve, we may face challenges in competing effectively, generating significant revenues, or maintaining the profitability of our consumption-based offerings. Additionally, the growing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may reduce overall demand for our traditional on-premises offerings sold through a capital expenditure (capex) model, which could negatively impact our revenues and cash flow, at least in the short term. Failure to successfully execute our consumption model strategy or anticipate customer needs could lead to a decline in our revenues and our profitability could decline.\nAs customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases, we will encounter differences in the timing of revenue recognition compared to our traditional purchase arrangements. Revenue from traditional purchases is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery, whereas revenue from consumption model offerings is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. We incur certain expenses related to the infrastructure and marketing of our consumption model offerings before we can recognize the associated revenues.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel to advance our corporate strategy and maintain key aspects of our corporate culture. As our future success relies on enhancing and introducing new products and features, we particularly need to attract and retain qualified engineers and technical talent, especially in emerging technology areas like AI and machine learning. To increase revenues, we must also increase the productivity of our sales force, which may require an increase in support infrastructure and personnel, to achieve adequate customer coverage.\nCompetition for qualified employees, particularly in the technology industry, is intense. We have periodically reduced our workforce, including restructuring plans announced in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2024, and fiscal 2",
