Lower average sales prices driven by lower demand resulted in a 2% decrease in revenues.\n—Cost of sales remained relatively unchanged, in 2024 compared to 2023. Fluctuations in our cost of sales are generally driven by changes in feedstock and energy costs. On an annual basis, feedstock and energy related costs generally represent approximately 75% to 80% of cost of sales. Other variable costs account for approximately 10% of cost of sales and fixed operating costs, consisting primarily of expenses associated with employee compensation, depreciation and amortization, and maintenance, account for the remainder.\n—During 2024, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $949 million, primarily consisting of impairments of property, plant and equipment of $892 million in our O&P-EAI and APS segments. During 2023, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $518 million, primarily consisting of a goodwill impairment charge of $252 million in our APS segment and an impairment charge of $192 million related to our European PO joint venture recognized in our I&D segment. See Notes 7, 8 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding impairment charges.\n—Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased by $106 million, or 7%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses.\n—Operating income decreased by $1,236 million, or 40%, in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2024, Operating income decreased for our O&P-EAI, Refining, and I&D segments by $848 million, $434 million and $311 million, respectively. Operating income for our APS, O&P-Americas and Technology segments increased by $213 million, $140 million and $4 million, respectively, in 2024 compared to 2023. Results for each of our business segments are discussed further in the Segment Analysis section below.\nGain on Sale of Business\n—In the second quarter of 2024, we completed the sale of our Ethylene Oxide & Derivatives (“EO&D”) business and associated production facilities located in Bayport, Texas and recognized a pre-tax gain of $284 million. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLoss from Equity Investments\n—Losses from equity investments increased $197 million, or 985%, in 2024 compared to 2023. Approximately 82% of the change was driven by our O&P-EAI segment, primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax valuation allowance charge by our Chinese joint venture. The remaining change was primarily driven by lower polypropylene margins at our Mexican joint venture in our O&P-Americas segment.\nOur effective income tax rates of 15.0% in 2024 and 19.1% in 2023 resulted in tax provisions of $240 million and $501 million, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for 2024 was primarily attributable to changes in earnings in countries with varying statutory tax rates, largely attributable to fourth quarter non-cash impairments decreasing the effective tax rate by 5.5% in comparison to 2023. There was a further decrease in the effective tax rate of 1.7% related to fluctuations in foreign exchange gains and losses, partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate of 2.6% related to reduced exempt income in 2024. For additional information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nComprehensive Income—\nComprehensive income decreased by $706 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a decrease in net income. The activities from the remaining components of Comprehensive income are discussed below.\nFinancial derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, primarily our commodity swaps, led to an increase in Comprehensive income of $195 million in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting commodity pricing volatility. Defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans led to an increase in Comprehensive income of $95 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to actuarial gains resulting from higher-than-expected asset returns offset by a decrease in discount rates. Foreign currency translations decreased Comprehensive income by $242 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro in 2024, offset by the effective portion of our net investment hedges. See Notes 13, 14 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions.\nWe use earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes. This measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of, and allocate resources to, our operating segments. Intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations, such as foreign exchange gains or losses and components of pension and other post-retirement benefits other than service costs, are included in “Other.” See the table below for a reconciliation of EBITDA to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measure.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA for each of the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\nIncome from continuing operations\nProvision for income taxes\nDepreciation and amortization\nInterest expense, net\nEBITDA\nOur continuing operations are managed through six reportable segments: O&P-Americas, O&P-EAI, I&D, APS, Refining and Technology. Revenues and other information for the periods presented are reflected in the tables below for our reportable segments:\nYear Ended December 31,\nSales and other operating revenues:\nO&P-Americas segment\nOther, including intersegment eliminations\nOperating income (loss):\nO&P-Americas segment\nOther, including intersegment eliminations\nYear Ended December 31,\nDepreciation and amortization:\nO&P-Americas segment\nIncome (loss) from equity investments:\nO&P-Americas segment\nO&P-Americas segment\nGain on sale of business:\nOther income (expense), net:\nO&P-Americas segment\nOther, including intersegment eliminations\nEBITDA:\nO&P-Americas segment\nOther, including intersegment eliminations\nOlefins and Polyolefins-Americas Segment\n—EBITDA increased in 2024 relative to 2023 primarily due to improved olefins margins, partially offset by lower polymer margins.\nIn calculating the impact of margin and volume on EBITDA, consistent with industry practice, management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene co-products against the cost to produce ethylene. Volume and price impacts of ethylene co-products are reported in margin.\nEthylene Raw Materials\n—Ethylene and its co-products are produced from two major raw material groups:\nnatural gas liquids (“NGLs”), principally ethane and propane, the prices of which are generally affected by natural gas prices; and\ncrude oil-based liquids (“liquids” or “heavy liquids”), including naphtha, condensates and gas oils, the prices of which are generally related to crude oil prices.\nWe have flexibility to vary the raw material mix and process conditions in our U.S. olefins plants in order to maximize profitability as market prices fluctuate for both feedstocks and products. Although prices of crude-based liquids and natural gas liquids are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices, during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly. Ethane made up approximately 75% and 70% of the raw materials used in our North American crackers in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth selected financial information for the O&P-Americas segment including Income from equity investments, which is a component of EBITDA.\n\nIn 2025, we are planning to invest approximately $1.9 billion in capital expenditures. Approximately $1.2 billion of the 2025 budget is planned for sustaining maintenance, with the remaining budget supporting profit-generating growth projects. Our profit-generating growth project budget includes approximately $350 million, for projects that support our sustainability goals, including investments in emissions reduction and our CLCS business. Our capital spending plans are aligned with our strategic pillars.\nCash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that may require us to make future cash payments under certain circumstances. Our cash requirements related to contractual and other obligations primarily consist of purchase obligations, principal and interest payments on outstanding debt, lease payments, pension and other post-retirement benefits and income taxes. For more information regarding our debt arrangements, lease obligations, pension and other post-retirement benefits and income taxes, see Notes 11, 12, 14 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.\nWe are party to obligations to purchase raw material\ns, utilities and industrial gases\nwhich are designed to ensure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements.\nThese purchase arrangements include provisions which state minimum purchase quantities or fixed-fees; however, in the event we do not take the contractual minimum volumes, we are obligated to compensate the vendor only for any resulting economic losses they suffer. No material fees were paid to vendors for such losses in 2024. Assuming that contractual minimum volumes are purchased at contract prices as of December 31, 2024, these commitments represent approximately 15% of our annual Cost of sales with a weighted average remaining term of 8 years.\nWe also have purchase obligations under take-or-pay agreements which require us to either buy and take delivery of a minimum quantity of goods or to pay for any shortfall. These arrangements largely relate to product off-take agreements with a joint venture located in Poland\nNo material shortfall was paid for quantities not taken under these contracts in 2024. When valued using a contract price as of December 31, 2024, these commitments represent approximately 5% of our annual Cost of sales with a weighted average remaining term of 14 years.\nCURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK\nIn 2025 we remain watchful and prepared for the macroeconomic catalysts that will eventually drive restocking of supply chains, improve demand for durable goods and support a more broad-based economic recovery. One indicator of recovery is that North American domestic demand for polyolefins rebounded in 2024, after two years of declines. Increased driving and summertime gasoline specifications should lead to typical seasonal improvements in oxyfuels margins. We expect a gradual recovery in oxyfuel margins over the summer months, with strong octane premiums and the relatively low cost of butane raw materials supportive of long-term oxyfuels fundamentals. Tariff and trade uncertainties are potential headwinds. Our refining operations will cease in the first quarter of 2025, a strategic milestone paving the way for continued growth in circular and low-carbon feedstocks and products. We are aligning our first quarter operating rates with global demand and expect to operate our O&P-Americas, O&P-EAI and I&D assets at approximately 80%, 75% and 80%, respectively.\nValue Enhancement Program (“VEP”)\nDuring 2022, we introduced our VEP, which expands capacity through low-cost debottlenecks and improved reliability, reduces costs and emissions by saving energy and increases margins through improvements in procurement, logistics and customer service. We estimate Net income and recurring annual EBITDA benefits for the VEP based on 2017 through 2019 mid-cycle margins and modest inflation relative to a 2021 baseline year. We believe recurring annual EBITDA is useful to investors because it represents a key measure used by management to assess progress towards our strategy of value creation.\nAt the end of 2024, we estimated VEP benefits to have a year-end annual run rate of approximately $610 million of Net income which, after adding back income taxes and depreciation and amortization of $155 million and $35 million, respectively, results in approximately $800 million of recurring annual EBITDA. We incurred one-time costs of approximately $200 million per year in 2023 and 2024 related to our Value Enhancement Program.\nWe anticipate that our VEP will achieve a 2025 year-end annual run rate of approximately $760 million of Net income, which, after adding back income taxes and depreciation and amortization of approximately $190 million and $50 million, respectively, results in approximately $1,000 million of recurring annual EBITDA. We estimate incurring one-time costs of $200 million in 2025 related to our Value Enhancement Program.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nWe have related party transactions with our joint ventures. We believe that such transactions are affected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arm’s length basis. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional related party disclosures.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nManagement applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management and updated periodically based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment.\nManagement believes the following accounting policies and estimates, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are critical in understanding our reported operating results and financial condition.\n—We account for our raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods inventories using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting.\nThe cost of raw materials, which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses, and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil and/or natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors, including changes in economic conditions.\nSince our inventory consists of manufactured products derived from crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and correlated materials, as well as the associated feedstocks and intermediate chemicals, our inventory market values are generally influenced by changes in the benchmark of crude oil and heavy liquid values and prices for manufactured finished goods. The degree of influence of a particular benchmark may vary from period to period, as the composition of the dollar value LIFO pools change. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is performed at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on our estimates of expected inventory levels and costs at the end of the year.\nLIFO value is measured at the total pool level. The impact of the measurement of each LIFO pool at the lower of cost or market value (“LCM”) is a fu",
