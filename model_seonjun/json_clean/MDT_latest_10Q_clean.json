Exit of business-related charges primarily relate to the impending separation of the Diabetes business and costs associated with the Company's June 2021 decision to stop the distribution and sale of the Medtronic HVAD System.\nWe exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on our minority investments as we do not believe that these components of income or expense have a direct correlation to our ongoing or future business operations.\nReflects adjustments to the Company's Italian payback accruals resulting from the two July 22, 2024 rulings by the Constitutional Court and the Legislative Decree published by the Italian government on June 30, 2025 for certain prior years since 2015.\nThe net benefit for the six months ended October 24, 2025 primarily includes a tax benefit recognized due to a change in estimate of accrued interest on uncertain tax positions, partially offset by amortization of previously established deferred tax assets arising from intercompany intellectual property transactions. The charges for the six months ended October 25, 2024 includes amortization of previously established deferred tax assets arising from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\nThe charges represent incremental costs of complying with the new European Union (E.U.) medical device regulations for previously registered products and primarily include charges for contractors supporting the project and other direct third-party expenses. We consider these costs to be duplicative of previously incurred costs and/or one-time costs.\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by subtracting additions to property, plant, and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. Free cash flow should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) and free cash flow are as follows:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nAdditions to property, plant, and equipment\nRefer to the Summary of Cash Flows section for drivers of the change in cash provided by operating activities.\nMacroeconomic Trends\nLooking ahead, a number of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could negatively impact our business, including without limitation:\nCompetitive product launches and pricing pressure, geographic macroeconomic developments including changes in global trade policies and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, general price inflation, changes in interest rates, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, delays in product registration approvals, national and provincial tender pricing for certain products, particularly in China, replacement cycle challenges, and supply chain challenges from time to time.\nRecent developments in global trade policy have introduced new uncertainties for our business. The U.S., China, and other jurisdictions have recently imposed or proposed additional tariffs on imported goods. Based on current rates as of November 18, 2025, we estimate the pre-tax net tariff impact to be $185 million in fiscal year 2026, with the majority recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the second half of the fiscal year. The actual amount could vary based on changes in tariff rates, duration of tariffs, scope of tariffs, and potential countermeasures or mitigation actions. While we are taking proactive steps to mitigate the effects of these tariffs, the evolving nature of international trade policy continues to present a risk to our cost structure and financial performance. Further escalation or expansion of trade barriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe sanctions and other measures being imposed in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict are having and could continue to have impacts on revenue and supply chain. The financial impact of the conflict for the three and six months ended October 24, 2025, including on accounts receivable and inventory reserves, was not material. For the three and six months ended October 24, 2025, the business of the Company in these countries represented less than 1% of the Company's consolidated revenues and assets.\nAlthough the long-term implications of Israel's conflict are difficult to predict at this time, the financial and operational impact of the conflict for the three and six months ended October 24, 2025, including on accounts receivable and inventory reserves, was not material. As of October 24, 2025, the Company had 6 facilities and approximately 1,300 employees in Israel and the business of the Company represented less than 1% of the Company's consolidated revenues and assets.\nNET SALES\nThe charts below illustrate the percent of net sales by segment for the three months ended October 24, 2025 and October 25, 2024:\nThe table below illustrates net sales by segment and division and market geography for the three and six months ended October 24, 2025 and October 25, 2024:\n\nThroughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we present certain financial measures that facilitate management's review of the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning; however, such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) (U.S. GAAP). These financial measures are considered \"non-GAAP financial measures\" and are intended to supplement, and should not be considered as superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the Company's underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry.\nAs presented in the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations section on the following pages, our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets and certain charges or benefits that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods (Non-GAAP Adjustments).\nIn the event there is a Non-GAAP Adjustment recognized in our operating results, the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported. Because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the Non-GAAP Adjustments that take place during the period, we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the non-GAAP nominal tax rate (Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate). The Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate is calculated as the income tax provision, adjusted for the impact of Non-GAAP Adjustments, as a percentage of income before income taxes, excluding Non-GAAP Adjustments.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting property, plant, and equipment additions from operating cash flows.\nRefer to the “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations,\" \"Income Taxes,\" and \"Free Cash Flow\" sections for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nEXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW\nMedtronic is the leading global healthcare technology company — alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for millions of people around the world.
