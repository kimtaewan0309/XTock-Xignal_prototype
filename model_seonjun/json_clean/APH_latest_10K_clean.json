The Company’s sales to distributors represented approximately 18% and 17% of the Company’s net sales in 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition to product design teams and collaborative initiatives with customers, the Company uses key account managers to manage certain customer relationships on a global basis so that it can bring to bear its total resources to meet the worldwide needs of its multinational customers.\nThe Company is a global manufacturer employing advanced manufacturing processes including molding, stamping, plating, turning, computer numerical control (CNC) machining, 3D printing, extruding, die casting, certain other manufacturing, automation and assembly operations and proprietary process technology for connectors, specialty and coaxial cable production, antenna and sensor fabrication. Outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes is used when cost-effective. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing facilities operate under certification to management system standards of globally recognized, industry certification organizations. Many of our facilities are certified to quality management systems, primarily ISO9001, but also may include ISO13485, AS9100, and IATF16949. In addition, approximately half of our facilities are also certified to environmental or occupational health and safety management systems, including ISO14001 and ISO45001.\nThe Company’s manufacturing facilities are generally vertically integrated operations from the initial design stage through final design and manufacturing. The Company designs, manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in approximately 40 countries around the world. Our global coverage positions us near many of our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production and logistics costs. In addition, the Company generally relies on local management in every region, which we believe creates a high degree of organizational stability and operational agility, as well as a deeper understanding of local markets. We believe our broad and balanced geographic distribution lowers our exposure to particular geographies. This was evident in recent years, as we were generally able to support our customers even if pandemic-related restrictions and other challenges were present in a particular geography. The Company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage, as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers, while at the same time offering a level of resiliency and diversification against local risks and challenges that may emerge in any single geography.\nThe Company employs a global manufacturing strategy to provide proximity and reliable service to customers, while also lowering production and logistics costs. Our strategy is to maintain strong cost and quality controls in our manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company evaluates and adjusts its expense levels and workforce to reflect current business conditions and attempts to maximize operating profitability as well as the return on capital investments. This strategy has been, and continues to be, critical to the Company’s ability to mitigate any potential supply chain constraints. The Company sources materials and components for its products on a worldwide basis. To better serve certain high-volume customers, the Company has established facilities near these major customers. The Company seeks to position its manufacturing and assembly facilities in order to serve local markets while coordinating, as appropriate, product design and manufacturing responsibility with the Company’s other operations around the world. For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s global operations, refer to the subsection titled “Risks Related to our Global Operations” included in Part I, Item 1A.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company’s product development strategy is to rely on product design teams at most of our business units around the world working collaboratively with customers, which often results in the Company obtaining approved vendor status for its customers’ new products and programs. The Company focuses its research and development efforts primarily on those product areas that it believes have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period. The Company seeks to have its products become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other potential customers, which the Company believes will provide additional sources of future revenue. At the end of 2024, our research, development and engineering efforts, which relate to the creation of new and improved products and processes, were supported by approximately 4,600 of our employees and were performed primarily by individual business units focused on specific markets and product technologies.\n\nIntellectual Property\nWe own a significant portfolio of patents that principally relate to mechanical, electrical, radio frequency, optical and electronic features of interconnect, antenna and sensor products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon the laws of various jurisdictions and the use of the trademarks.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in disputes with third parties regarding the Company’s or such third party’s intellectual property assets, particularly patents. While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by the loss of any single patent or group of related patents, or by a third party’s successful enforcement of its patents against us or any of our products. For a discussion of certain risks related to the Company’s intellectual property, refer to the risk factor titled “\nWe may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others\n” in Part I, Item 1A.\nThe Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials for the manufacture of its products, including (i) precious metals such as gold, silver and palladium, (ii) aluminum, steel, copper, titanium and metal alloy products and (iii) plastic materials. The Company also purchases a wide variety of mechanical and electronic components for the manufacturing of its products. Such raw materials and components are generally available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of suppliers. The Company is generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or components or, if one source is used, the Company generally attempts to protect itself through long-term supply agreements. From time to time, the Company has encountered, and in the future may encounter, difficulties in obtaining certain raw materials or components necessary for production at reasonable costs due to supply chain constraints and logistical challenges, which may include regulatory restrictions and the imposition of additional tariffs. These difficulties may also negatively impact the pricing of materials and components sourced or used by the Company. While the Company does not currently anticipate significant, broad-based difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components necessary for production, inflationary pressures and increased commodity prices may impact the cost and availability of certain raw materials and components used by the Company and result in supply shortages for discrete raw materials or components. For a discussion of certain risks related to the availability of and dependence on raw materials and components, refer to the risk factor titled “\nThe Company and certain of its suppliers and customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, difficulties obtaining certain raw materials and components, and the cost of certain of the Company’s raw materials and components may increase\n” in Part I, Item 1A.\nherein. Information regarding our obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services is disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company encounters competition in all areas of its business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. Primary competitors include Aptiv, Belden, CommScope, Eaton, Foxconn, Glenair, HARTING, Hirose, HUBER+SUHNER, ICT Luxshare, JAE, Jonhon, JST, Molex, Phoenix Contact, Radiall, Rosenberger, Sensata, TE Connectivity and Yazaki, among others. In addition, the Company competes with a large number of smaller companies who compete in specific geographies, markets or products. For a discussion of certain risks related to competition, refer to the risk factor titled “\nThe Company encounters competition in all areas of our business\n” in Part I, Item 1A.\n\nAmphenol Corporation is one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors and interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial, high-speed and specialty cable. The Company estimates, based on recent reports of industry analysts, that worldwide sales of interconnect and sensor-related products were approximately $250 billion in 2024.\nCertain predecessor businesses of the Company were founded in 1932, and the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1986. The Company’s Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991.\nReportable Business Segments\nThe Company’s strategy is to provide our customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of quality and service on a worldwide basis, while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. The Company aligns its businesses into three reportable business segments:\nHarsh Environment Solutions\nCommunications Solutions\n\nThe Company’s overall strategy is to provide our customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of quality and service on a worldwide basis, while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. Specifically, our business strategy is as follows:\nPursue broad market diversification\n- The Company constantly strives to increase the diversity of its markets, customers, applications and products. Due to the tremendous variety of opportunities in the electronics industry, management believes that it is important to participate wherever significant growth opportunities are available. This diversification positions us to proliferate our technologies across the broadest array of opportunities and reduces our exposure to any one particular market, t",
