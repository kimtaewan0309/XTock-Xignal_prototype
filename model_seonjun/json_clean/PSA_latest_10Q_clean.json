All of our forward-looking statements, including those in this report, are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, new estimates, or other factors, events or circumstances after the date of these forward-looking statements, except when expressly required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, neither as predictions of future events nor guarantees of future performance.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances to determine reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nOur self-storage operations generate most of our net income, and our earnings growth is impacted by the levels of organic growth within our Same Store Facilities (as defined below) as well as within our Acquired Facilities and Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities (both as defined below).\nRevenues generated by our Same Store Facilities remained relatively unchanged for three months ended September 30, 2025 and increased 0.1% ($2.8 million) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same periods in 2024. Cost of operations for Same Store Facilities remained relatively unchanged for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and increased by 1.0% ($7.2 million) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same periods in 2024. For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, realized annual rent per occupied square foot for our Same Store Facilities increased by 0.6%, while average occupancy decreased by 0.5%, as compared to the same periods in 2024.\nWe have grown and plan to continue to grow through the acquisition and development of new facilities and expansion of our existing self-storage facilities. Since the beginning of 2023, we acquired a total of 260 facilities with 19.0 million net rentable square feet for $3.8 billion. Within our non-same store portfolio as of September 30, 2025, our Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities include a total of 103 self-storage facilities with 12.4 million net rentable square feet. For development and expansions completed by September 30, 2025, we incurred a total cost of $1.5 billion. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, combined net operating income generated by our Acquired Facilities and Newly Developed and Expanded Facilities increased 31.1% ($18.6 million) and 22.8% ($39.1 million), respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2024.\nWe have embarked on a solar program under which we plan to install solar panels on over 1,500 of our self-storage facilities. We have completed the installations on 1,108 facilities through September 30, 2025. We spent approximately $49 million on the program in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and expect to spend approximately $75 million over 2025 on this effort.\nOn June 30, 2025, PSOC completed a public offering of $875 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, including $475 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes bearing interest at an annual rate of 4.375% maturing on July 1, 2030 and $400 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes bearing interest at an annual rate of 5.000% maturing on July 1, 2035. In connection with the offering of senior notes due July 1, 2030, we entered into five-year interest rate swaps in order to manage our variable rate assets. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges, which convert the debt’s fixed interest rate to variable rate. Using the proceeds from this offering we repaid PSOC’s outstanding $400 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes bearing interest at a rate of Compounded SOFR + 0.60% at maturity on July 25, 2025. We plan to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to make investments in self-storage facilities.\nOn October 3, 2025, PSOC completed a public offering of €425 million principal amount of senior notes, bearing interest at an annual rate of 3.500% and maturing on January 20, 2034. The senior notes are guaranteed by Public Storage. We received €420.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance. We plan to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay the outstanding €242 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.175% senior notes due November 2025 and for general corporate purposes, described above.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $461.4 million or $2.62 per diluted common share, compared to $380.7 million or $2.16 per diluted common share for the same period in 2024, representing an increase of $80.7 million or $0.46 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $71.5 million increase in foreign currency gain primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable and (ii) a $21.7 million increase in self-storage net operating income, partially offset by (iii) a $10.0 million increase in depreciation expense and (iv) a $5.4 million increase in interest expense.\nThe $21.7 million increase in self-storage net operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024 is a result of a $21.5 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below) reflecting the impact of newly acquired facilities and the lease-up of development/expansion properties.\nOperating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 and 2024\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1.1 billion or $6.42 per diluted common share, compared to $1.3 billion or $7.43 per diluted common share for the same period in 2024, representing a decrease of $179.7 million or $1.01 per diluted common share. The decrease is due primarily to (i) a $193.3 million increase in foreign currency exchange losses primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable, and (ii) a $10.4 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities partially offset by (iii) a $42.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income.\nThe $42.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024 is a result of a $47.0 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities, partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease attributable to our Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 0.1% or $2.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot offset by a decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 1.0% or $7.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, due primarily to increased property tax expense and centralized management costs, partially offset by decreased on-site property manager payroll expense and marketing. The increase in net operating income of $47.0 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of newly acquired properties and the lease-up of development/expansion properties.\nFunds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per diluted common share (“FFO per share”) are non-GAAP measures defined by Nareit. We believe that FFO and FFO per share are useful to REIT investors and analysts in measuring our performance because Nareit’s definition of FFO excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating and financial performance. FFO represents net income before real estate-related depreciation and amortization, which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges, which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, FFO was $4.33 per diluted common share as compared to $3.80 per diluted common share for the same period in 2024, representing an increase of 13.9%, or $0.53 per diluted common share.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2025, FFO was $11.48 per diluted common share as compared to $12.34 pe"
