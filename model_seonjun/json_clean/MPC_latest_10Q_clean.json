demand and by gasoline and distillate inventory levels in the U.S. that were at or below five-year averages during the quarter. Longer term, global demand growth is expected to outpace the net impact of refining capacity additions and rationalizations through the end of the decade. We anticipate these fundamentals, as well as the U.S. refining industry’s current structural advantages over the rest of the world, will support a constructive environment for U.S. refiners.\nOur Midstream segment contributed strong results and continued growth in the third quarter of 2025, benefitting from the expansion of its Permian to Gulf Coast natural gas and NGL value chains with the acquisition of Northwind Delaware Holdings LLC and BANGL, LLC and progression of long-haul pipeline growth projects. We believe our Midstream business is well positioned and has significant opportunities to support the development plans of its producer customers.\nMidstream Transactions\nNorthwind Midstream Acquisition\nOn August 29, 2025, MPLX completed the $2.4 billion acquisition of Northwind Delaware Holdings LLC (the “Northwind Midstream Acquisition”), which provides sour gas gathering and treating services in Lea County, New Mexico, enhancing MPLX’s Permian natural gas and NGL value chain. The Northwind Midstream Acquisition provides optionality to direct volumes through our integrated system to accelerate growth opportunities in the Permian. The Northwind Midstream Acquisition was financed, and the incremental capital expenditures associated with in-process expansion projects will be funded, with the net proceeds from MPLX's $4.5 billion senior notes issued in August 2025.\nSee Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on this transaction.\nAnnounced Divestiture of Rockies Operations\nOn August 26, 2025, MPLX entered into a definitive agreement to divest its Rockies operations to a subsidiary of Harvest Midstream (“Harvest”) for $1.0 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments.\nThe assets and liabilities to be sold as part of this transaction are shown on the consolidated balance sheet as assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale, r"
