We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. We orient our business strategy and invest for future growth by focusing on the following key priorities:\nExpand relationships with existing customers.\nWe see significant opportunities to deepen existing customer relationships through cross-selling and upselling our service offerings. For example, we continue to focus on driving multiple service offering adoption, which provides our customers with a one-stop-shop for their front-office business technology needs. As our customers realize the benefits of our entire suite of service offerings, we aim to upgrade the customers’ experience with new products and features and gain additional subscriptions by targeting new functional areas and business units. Finally, we aim to expand our relationships with existing customers through our additional support offerings.\nIncrease geographic reach.\nBy extending our go-to-market capabilities globally, we aim to grow our business by selling to new customers in new regions. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in most major markets globally. We also plan to continue to develop distribution channels through new and existing marketplaces and partners for our solutions around the globe and new go-to-market strategies. We continue to invest in our domestic and international operations and infrastructure to deliver the highest-quality service to our customers around the world.\nFocus on industries and new products.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative and value-driven solutions in new categories based on our existing and potential customers’ needs. For example, we provide out-of-the-box solutions specifically built for customers in certain industries, such as financial services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing and more. In addition, through direct discussions and strategic engagements with our customers, we are able to deliver the innovations and enhancements that align with the needs of our customers. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, the agentic layer of the Salesforce Platform for deploying autonomous AI agents across any business function. Agentforce includes a set of tools to create and customize AI agents, as well as a library of ready-to-use skills for any use case across sales, service, marketing and commerce, Tableau, Slack, partners and more.\nLeverage our partner ecosystem.\nThe Salesforce Platform enables customers, independent software vendors (“ISVs”) and third-party developers to create, test and deliver cloud-based applications. These applications can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our enterprise cloud marketplace, or sold directly by software vendors. In addition, we rely on our consulting partners to deliver technology solutions and expertise to customers, from large-scale implementations to more limited solutions that help businesses run more efficiently. We continue to work with and invest in our partner ecosystem, including these ISVs and system integrators (“SIs”), to accelerate our reach into new markets and industries.\nPromote strong customer adoption and reduce customer attrition.\nWe believe that we have the people, processes and proven innovation to help companies transform successfully. Our customer success programs, including success management resources, advisory services, technical architects and business strategists, help enable and accelerate our customers’ digital transformations. In addition, we have free, curated resources such as Trailhead to help companies learn our systems and a community of Trailblazers who drive innovation. With these programs and resources, we aim to reduce attrition and secure renewals of existing customer subscriptions.\nMergers and Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\nWe evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property to complement our organic innovation and advance the development of our Salesforce Platform. Our evaluation seeks to confirm that any potential acquisition accelerates our strategy, represents an attractive customer opportunity, provides a pathway to effectively monetize the acquired products and drive significant operational efficiencies and presents a clear timeline for value accretion. Our acquisitions can range in size and complexity, from those that enhance or complement existing products and accelerate development of features to large-scale acquisitions that result in new service offerings. Our goal is to prioritize the use of our balance sheet, through cash and debt, to complete acquisitions.\nWe also manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and SIs. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company’s initial public offering. We invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives, including AI. We plan to continue making these types of strategic investments as opportunities arise that we find attractive, including investments in companies representing targeted businesses, technological initiatives and geographies. Our strategy includes growing our strategic investment portfolio, in part, by reinvesting proceeds from the sa",
  "item7_clean": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSalesforce is a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology, enabling companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers through the power of data, artificial intelligence (“AI”), CRM and trust. Founded in 1999, we bring humans together with AI agents to drive customer success on one deeply unified platform.\nOur platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth and integrated AI, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized experiences across every channel and increase productivity. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, a new layer of our trusted platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. We continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative and agentic AI across all products, which we believe will change how our customers help their customers, and continuously look to expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry.\nWe continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and expanding our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average.\nIn addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026. We have started to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales a\nnd marketing expense and general and administrative expenses. Over the long term, we expect to see additional operating expense improvements, which could include various restructuring initiatives or measured hiring initiatives to drive operational efficiencies.\nHighlights from Fiscal 2025\nFor fiscal 2025, revenue was\nIncome from Operations:\nFor fiscal 2025, income from operations was\nfrom a year ago. Operating margin, which represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue, increased to approximately\nfor fiscal 2025 compared to approximately\nNet Income per Share:\n, diluted net income per share was\nas compared to diluted net income per share of $4.20 from a year ago.\nCash provided by operations for fiscal 2025 was $13.1 billion, an increase of 28 percent y\near-over-year. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2025 was\n\nRemaining Performance Obligation:\nTotal remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenue under contract yet to be recognized, as of January 31, 2025 was approximately\n$63.4 billion, an increase of 11 percent year-over-year\n. Current remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2025 was approximately\nShare Repurchase Program:\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we repurchased approximately 30 million shares of our common stock for approximately $7.8 billion.\n: During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends.\nIn the second half of fiscal 2025, we continued seeing increasing momentum for Agentforce and other AI service offerings. Outside of the demand for AI, the buying environment trends seen over the past two fiscal years have stabilized. A reemergence of slower growth in new and renewal business could impact our remaining performance obligation, revenues and our ability to meet financial guidance and long-term targets.\nIn addition, the expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. Total revenues in the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2025 were minimally impacted by foreign currency\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\nOur current remaining performance obligatio\nn growth as of January 31, 2025 compared to January 31, 2024 was negatively impacted by two percent compared to what would have been reported using constant currency rates. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations could impact our near-term results and ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. The impact of these fluctuations can also be compounded by the seasonality of our business in which our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals.\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025.\nWe operate as one segment. See Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately\nof our total revenues for fiscal 2025.\nSubscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, “Cloud Services”), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses, and support revenues from the sale of support and updates beyond the basic subscription fees or related to the sales of software licenses. Our Cloud Services allow customers to use our multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from support and updates is recognized as such support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term. Changes in contract duration for multi-year term software licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront. Revenues from term software licenses represent less than\nof total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2025.\nThe revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings, as described below in “Results of Operations,” fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. Additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and, as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. In addition, some of our Cloud Service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use our Sales, Service or Platform service offerings to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage.\nOur growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. Attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. We calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of each month. In general, we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until they are fully\nintegrated into our customer success organization. As of January 31, 2025, our attrition rate, excluding Slack self-service, was approximately eight percent.\nWe continue to maintain a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues.\nSeasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow\nUnearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Generally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter\nUnearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity.\nRemaining Performance Obligation\nOur remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.\nRemaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation.\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses\nCost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to our employee-related costs, which includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, and allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts. Also included in the cost of subscription and support revenues are expenses incurred supporting the free user base of Slack, including third-party hosting costs and employee-related costs specific to customer experience and technical operations.\nCost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. We believe that our professional services organization facilitates the adoption of our service offerings, helps us to secure larger subscription revenue contracts and supports our customers’ success. The cost of professional services may exceed revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our engineering staff associated with product development, as well as allocated overhead.\n\nFiscal Year Ended January 31,\nAs a % of Total Revenues\nAs a % of Total Revenues\nResearch and development\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal operating expenses\nFor fiscal 2025, the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense. Research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal 2025 increased by one percent from the same period a year ago primarily due to an increase in relative employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense. Our research and development headcount increased by 13 percent during fiscal 2025, primarily in lower cost regions.\nWe expect that research and development expenses will likely remain consistent as a percentage of revenue over time as we continue to invest in technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies, including AI, agents and our Data Cloud service offerings, and the integration of acquired technologies.\nFor fiscal 2025, the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, including stock-ba",
