  "item1_clean": "stores—Ross Dress for Less\n(“Ross”) and dd’s DISCOUNTS\nRoss is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with 1,831 locations in 43 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, as of February 1, 2025. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices every day. Ross’ target customers are primarily from middle income households.\nWe also operate 355 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 22 states as of February 1, 2025. dd’s DISCOUNTS features more moderately-priced first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day. The typical dd’s DISCOUNTS store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood, and its target customers typically come from households with lower to more moderate incomes.\nBoth our Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS brands target value-driven customers. The decisions we make, from merchandising, purchasing, and pricing, to the locations of our stores, are based on these customer profiles. We believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories, in organized and easy-to-shop in-store environments.\nOur mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives:\nMaintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands, labels, and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store.\nMeet customer needs on a local basis.\nDeliver an in-store shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the off-price customer.\nManage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets.\nOur fiscal years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024, and January 28, 2023 are referred to as fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, respectively. Fiscal 2023 was a 53-week year. Fiscal 2024 and 2022 were each 52-week years.\nMerchandising, Purchasing, and Pricing\nWe seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of first-quality, in-season, brand name and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices every day at Ross, and 20% to 70% below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s DISCOUNTS. We aim to sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is on trend and fashionable in each category. New merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis, enabling them to respond to selling trends and buying opportunities in the market. Our merchandising strategy is reflected in our marketing, which emphasizes a strong value message. Our stores offer a “treasure-hunt” shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home.\nOur merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of off-price buying techniques to purchase advance-of-season, in-season, and past-season merchandise for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. We believe merchandise with nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success. We generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell.\nWe establish merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers. We generally offer a large selection within each classification of our merchandise, with a wide assortment of vendors, labels, prices, colors, styles, and fabrics within each size or item. Our merchandise offerings include apparel, footwear, home accents and furniture, bed and bath, beauty, accessories, toys, gourmet food, luggage, electronics, pet accessories, jewelry and watches, and cookware.\nWe have a large network of merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS, and believe we have adequate sources of first-quality merchandise to meet our requirements. We purchase the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers.\nWe believe our ability to effectively execute certain off-price buying strategies is a key factor in our success. Our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day relative to department and specialty stores for Ross, and to moderate department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS. By purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department, specialty, and discount stores, we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products.\nWe typically do not require that vendors or manufacturers provide promotional allowances, co-op advertising allowances, return privileges, drop shipments to stores, or delayed deliveries of merchandise. For most orders, delivery is made to one of our distribution centers. These flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on purchases.\nThe merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer and brand overruns and canceled orders, both during and at the end of a season (“close-out” purchases), and production direct from brands and factories (“upfront” purchases). We also source merchandise under in-house brands or vendor brands. Upon receipt, merchandise can be shipped to stores in-season or can be stored in our warehouses as “packaway” merchandise.\nPackaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months.\nIn fiscal 2024, we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace. As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, packaway accounted for approximately 41% and 40% of total inventories, respectively.\nOur primary buying offices are located in New York City and Los Angeles, the nation’s two largest apparel markets. We also operate a smaller buying office located in Boston.\nThese strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market frequently, sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers. Thes\ne locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our off-price buying strategies.\nAt the end of fiscal 2024, we had over 800 merchants for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS combined. The Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS buying organizations are separate and distinct, with each organization led by its own chief merchandising officer with a team of merchandise management, buyers, and assistant buyers. Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS buyers have on average over seven years of experience, including merchandising positions with other retailers. We expect to make continued investments in our merchant organization to further develop our relationships with our manufacturers and vendors. Our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts.\nThe off-price buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase Ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores, and to purchase dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores.\nWe sell brand name merchandise at Ross that is priced 20% to 60% below most department and specialty store regular prices. At dd’s DISCOUNTS, we sell more moderate brand name merchandise that is priced 20% to 70% below most moderate department and discount store regular prices. Our pricing is reflected on most of our price tags, which display our selling price as well as the comparable value for that item in department and specialty stores for Ross merchandise, or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise.\nOur pricing strategy at Ross differs from that of a department or specialty store. We purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store. This strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and compelling value. Our buyers review their departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale on a weekly basis, as well as at the end of fashion seasons, to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product to our stores. A similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s DISCOUNTS where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores.\nAs of February 1, 2025, we operated a total of 2,186 stores, comprised of 1,831 Ross stores and 355 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas. Where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit, our real estate strategy is to cluster Ross stores with the objective to increase our market penetration and to benefit from economies of scale in advertising, distribution, field management, and other costs. When evaluating a new store location, we consider factors such as the availability and quality of potential sites, demographic characteristics, competition, and population density of the local trade area. In addition, we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions. Where possible, we obtain sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations, allowing us to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time and at reasonable costs in a given market. We do the same for dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.\nWe believe a key element of our success at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS is our organized and easy-to-shop in-store environment, which allows customers to shop at their own pace. While our stores promote a self-service, treasure-hunt shopping experience, the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation, dressing rooms, checkout, and merchandise return areas. Our store’s sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout. A customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department. We enable our customers to select among sizes and styles through prominent category and sizing markers. Our stores have shopping carts and/or baskets available at the entrance for customer convenience. Cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing.\nWe accept a variety of payment methods. We provide refunds or store credit on all merchandise (not used, worn, or altered) returned with a receipt within 30 days. Merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit.\nConsistent with the other aspects of our business strategy, we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible. Among the factors which have enabled us to do this are: labor costs that are generally lower th",
  "item7_clean": "Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2024 increased $458.9 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the 3% comparable store sales increase and higher sales from the opening of 77 net new stores during fiscal 2024.\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2024 decreased approximately 40 basis points from fiscal 2023 primarily due to a 45 basis point decrease in buying costs mainly due to lower incentive compensation expense, a 45 basis point decrease in distribution costs, and a 30 basis point decrease in domestic freight costs. Partially offsetting these items was a 60 basis point decrease in merchandise margin primarily due to our continued efforts to offer more sharply priced branded bargains and a 20 basis point increase in occupancy costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses.\nFor fiscal 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased $15.5 million compared to the prior year. In December 2024, we completed the sale of a packaway warehouse facility and recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of $61.6 million. This sale, along with lower incentive compensation expense, partially offset the increase in SG&A which was primarily driven by the opening of 77 net new stores during fiscal 2024.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2024 decreased 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to the gain recognized from the previously mentioned packaway facility sale and lower incentive compensation expense.\nOperating income as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2024 increased 90 basis points compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower cost of goods sold and lower SG&A expenses.\nIn fiscal 2025, we expect operating income as a percentage of sales to be impacted by sales deleverage, higher distribution costs, and lower incentive compensation expense.\nInterest (income) expense, net\n\nCash used in investing activities\nCash used in financing activities\nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.4 billion in fiscal 2024. This was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and the gain on sale of property (i.e., packaway warehouse facility), partially offset by the payment of fiscal 2023 incentive bonuses in fiscal 2024. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion in fiscal 2023. This was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization, and\nstock-based compensation. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in fiscal\nThis was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, and an increase in deferred income taxes, partially offset by merchandise inventory payments and payment of fiscal 2021 incentive bonuses.\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by\nhigher incentive compensation payments, partially offset by higher net earnings.\nAccounts payable leverage\n(defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory)\n89% as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024\nThe decrease in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts and related payments versus last year.\nAs a regular part of our business, packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling merchandise purchase opportunities in the marketplace and our decisions on the timing for release of that inventory to our stores. Packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage for less than six months. We expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers.\nChanges in packaway inventory levels affect our operating cash flow. Packaway inventory was 41% of total inventory at the end of fiscal 2024, compared to 40% at the end of fiscal 2023.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $637 million, $763 million, and $654 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022\nrespectively, and was primarily related to our capital expenditures. In fiscal 2024, capital expenditures were partially offset by cash proceeds from the sale of the packaway warehouse facility. Our capital expenditures include costs to build, expand, and improve distribution centers, open new stores and improve existing stores, and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems and buying and corporate offices.\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 related to our new Buckeye, Arizona distribution center and cash proceeds from the sale of the packaway facility, partially offset by the purchase of land and the start of construction for our next distribution center.\nOur capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below:\nDistribution and transportation\n\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. Our self-insurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required. A five percent increase or decrease in our insurance reserves would not have materially impacted our net earnings in fiscal 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRoss Stores, Inc. operates two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores—Ross Dress for Less\n(“Ross”) and dd’s DISCOUNTS\n. Ross is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with 1,831 locations in 43 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam, as of February 1, 2025. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices every day. We also operate 355 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 22 states as of February 1, 2025 that feature a more moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day.\nOur primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing off-price strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term. Macroeconomic pressures and uncertainties continue to impact both consumer confidence and discretionary spending. We are closely monitoring these external factors, along with market share trends for the off-price industry. We believe that our flexible business model better positions us to navigate through uncertainty, and we plan to continue to focus on strong execution of our key initiatives. We believe that our market share gains can continue to grow through our continued focus on bringing value and convenience to our customers.\nOur merchandising strategies emphasize consistently offering a wide assortment of quality branded bargains for our customers. We believe that our merchandising and operational strategies enable us to deliver the most competitive bargains available to meet our customers’ ongoing demand for quality branded goods for the family and home at compelling discounts every day. Additionally, we anticipate the current retail environment will result in more opportunities for us to obtain close-out merchandise and to deliver even greater values on branded goods. We believe that staying diligently focused on executing our merchandising strategies is an important driver of our ability to gain market share in fiscal 2025 and the long term.\nThe fiscal years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024, and January 28, 2023 are referred to as fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, respectively. Fiscal 2023 was a 53-week year. Fiscal 2024 and 2022 were each 52-week years.\n\nInterest (income) expense, net\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 was approximately 24%. Our effective tax rate represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in tax law and accounting guidance, location of new stores, level of earnings, tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, and the resolution of tax positions with various tax authorities.\nDiluted earnings per share in fiscal 2024 was\ncompared to $5.56 in the prior year. Fiscal 2024 earnings include a per share benefit of approximately $0.14 from the sale of the packaway warehouse facility. Fiscal\nearnings include a per share benefit of approximatel\ny $0.20 from the 53rd week\nuted earnings per share in fiscal 2024 was primarily attributab\nle to a 12% increase in net earnings and a 2% reduction in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding largely due to stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and short-term trade credit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, operating and variable lease costs, taxes, capital expenditures related to our new and existing stores, and investments in distribution centers, information systems, and buying and corporate offices. We also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs, pay dividends, and repay debt as it becomes due. In September 2024, we repaid at maturity the $250 million principal amount of the 3.375% Senior Notes. As of February 1, 2025, we had $700 million principal amount of 4.600% Senior Notes that will reach maturity in 2025.\nCash provided by operating activities\n\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2025 are projected to be approximately $855 million. Our planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 are for costs to open new stores and improve existing stores, investments in our supply chain to support long-term growth, including construction of our next distribution centers, investments in our information technology systems, and for various other expenditures related to our stores, distribution centers, and buying and corporate offices. We expect to fund capital expenditures with available cash. The increase in our planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 is primarily driven by investments in our next distribution centers, new and existing store improvements, and various investments in our information technology systems.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.9 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.4 billion in fiscal 2024, 2023\n, and 2022, respectively, primarily resulting from stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and dividend payments. In fiscal\nrepaid the $250 million principal amount of the\nSenior Notes in September 2024.\nRevolving credit facilities.\nWe have a $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”). As of\n, we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility, t\nCredit Facility remained in place and available, and\nwe were in compliance with the financial covenant. Refer to Note D: Debt\n\nTotal stores open at the end of fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 were 2,186, 2,109, and 2,015, respectively. The number of stores at the end of fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 increased by 4%, 5%, and 5% from the respective prior years. In fiscal 2024,\nLooking forward to 2025, we expect to open approximately 90 new stores. Our long-term strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store profitability, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria. We continue to believe that consumers’ focus on value and convenience provide opportunities for us to gain market share.\nThe following table summarizes the stores opened and closed during fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022:\nBeginning of the period\n\nAmount excludes excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, we also acquired 0.6 million, 0.5 million, and 0.5 million shares of treasury stock, respectively, from our employee equity incentive plans for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $86.1 million, $48.6 million, and $48.9 million, respectively.\nOn March 4, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4050 per common share, payable on March 31, 2025.\nOur Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.3675 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2024. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.3350 per common share in February, May, August, and November 2023, and a cash dividend of $0.3100 per common share in March, May, August, and November 2022.\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, we paid dividends of $488.7 million, $454.8 million, and $431.3 million, respectively.\nShort-term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for our merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade credit, bank credit facility, and other credit sources to meet our capital and liquidity requirements.\nDuring fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations.\nWe ended fiscal 2024 with $4.7 billion of unrestricted cash balances, which were held primarily in overnight money market funds invested in U.S. treasury and government instruments across a highly diversified set of banks and other financial institutions. We also have $1.3 billion available under our Credit Facility. We estimate that existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows from operations, our bank credit facility, and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned capital investments, debt repayments, interest payments, common stock repurchases, and quarterly dividend payments for at least the next 12 months.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of February 1, 2025:\nRecorded contractual obligations:\nNew York buying office ground lease\nUnrecorded contractual obligations:\nReal estate obligations\nInterest payment obligations\nPurchase obligations\nTotal contractual obligations\nWe have a $61.3 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits that is included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
