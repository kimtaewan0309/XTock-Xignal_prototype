Demand increased across the Growth Portfolio and for\n, which was offset by the impact of generics across the remainder of the Legacy Portfolio\nAdditionally, year-to-date revenues were impacted by the redesign of the U.S. Medicare Part D program.\nThe $0.48 increase in GAAP EPS for the third quarter of 2025 was primarily due to the impact of certain specified items, including lower amortization of acquired intangible assets, and cost savings from our ongoing strategic productivity initiative in 2025, partially offset by higher one-time Acquired IPRD charges. After adjusting for specified items, the $0.17 decrease in non-GAAP EPS was primarily due to higher one-time Acquired IPRD charges, partially offset by costs savings from our ongoing strategic productivity initiative in 2025.\nThe $7.38 increase in GAAP EPS year-to-date was primarily due to lower one-time Acquired IPRD charges, the impact of certain specified items, including lower amortization of acquired intangible assets, and cost savings from our ongoing strategic productivity initiative in 2025. After adjusting for specified items, the $5.42 increase in non-GAAP EPS was primarily due to lower one-time Acquired IPRD charges and cost savings from our ongoing strategic productivity initiative in 2025.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude specified items that represent certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other items impacting the comparability of financial results. For further information and reconciliations relating to our non-GAAP financial measures refer to \"—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nEconomic and Market Factors\nGovernmental Actions\nAs regulators continue to focus on prescription drugs, our products are facing increased pressures across the portfolio. These pressures stem from legislative and policy changes, including price controls, pharmaceutical market access, discounting, changes to tax and importation laws and other restrictions in the U.S., EU and other regions around the world. These pressures have resulted in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and smaller populations for whom payers will reimburse, which can negatively impact our results of operations (including intangible asset impairment charges), operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. In August 2024, as part of the first round of government price setting pursuant to the IRA, the HHS announced the \"maximum fair price\" for a 30-day equivalent supply of\n, which applies to the U.S. Medicare channel effective January 1, 2026. In January 2025, the HHS selected\nas a medicine subject to \"negotiation\" for government-set prices beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products could be selected in future years based upon the selection criteria currently utilized by the HHS or potentially expanded future criteria. This could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiry of intellectual property protections. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our results of operations, and it is possible that these changes may result in a material impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn May 2025, President Trump issued an executive order entitled, \"Delivering Most-Favored Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to American Patients,\" which, among various proposals, directs the HHS to facilitate direct-to-consumer purchasing programs for pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell their products to American patients at the most-favored-nation price and to communicate most-favored-nation price targets to manufacturers and propose a rulemaking plan to impose most-favored-nation pricing if “significant progress” is not made towards achieving such pricing. On July 31, 2025, the Trump administration sent letters to several pharmaceutical manufacturers, including BMS, which outlined steps that such manufacturers should take to advance certain objectives of the executive order. While there is significant uncertainty around the potential implementation of this executive order and related rule-making, it could result in reduced prices and reimbursement for certain of our U.S. products and may significantly impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\nIn July 2025, the OBBBA was enacted which, among other things, aims to achieve efficiencies in U.S. federal government healthcare spending over the next decade, primarily within Medicaid. Additionally, this legislation makes permanent many provisions of the TCJA and modifies certain rules, including within the international tax framework, thereby offering increased certainty for future business planning. The OBBBA also permits businesses to immediately deduct up to 100% of their qualifying domestic R&D expenses in the year they are incurred for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024, and allows businesses to accelerate deductions (over a one- or two-year period) of domestic R&D expenses that were deferred from 2022 to 2024. We are continuing to assess the full scope of this legislation and its potential commercial implications, and it is possible that these changes may impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nAt the state level, multiple states have passed, are pursuing or are considering government action via legislation or regulations to change drug pricing and reimbursement (e.g., establishing prescription drug affordability boards, implementing manufacturer mandates tied to the Federal Public Health Service Act drug pricing program, etc.). Some of these state-level actions may also influence federal and other state policies and legislation. Given the current uncertainty surrounding the adoption, timing and implementation of many of these measures, as well as pending litigation challenging such laws, we are unable to predict their full impact on our business. However, such measures could modify or decrease access, coverage, or reimbursement of our products, or result in significant changes to our sales or pricing practices, which could have a material impact on our revenues and results of operations. With respect to the Federal Public Health Service Act drug pricing program, certain states have enacted laws regulating manufacturer pricing obligations under the program to date. Several additional states are considering similar potential legislation or other government actions, and we expect other states may do the same in the future.\nThe United States and other countries have recently imposed, and may continue to impose, new tariffs. While pharmaceuticals are largely exempt from the recently imposed U.S. tariffs, such exemptions may be terminated or may not apply to any future tariffs. Additionally, pharmaceuticals are not exempt from certain tariffs recently imposed outside of the United States. We continue to evaluate the impacts of tariffs on our business and results of operations, and it is possible that these changes, or any future changes, may result in a material impact on our business and results of operations.\nSignificant Product and Pipeline Approvals\nThe following is a summary of the significant approvals received in 2025 as of October 30, 2025:\nJapan’s Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare approval of\nfor the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent microsatellite instability-high (MSI-High) colorectal cancer.\nJapan’s Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare approval of\nfor the treatment of unresectable HCC.\nJapan’s Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare approval of\nfor the treatment of myelofibrosis.\nfor use across multiple adult solid tumors as monotherapy, monotherapy maintenance following completion of intravenous\ncombination therapy, or in combination with chemotherapy or cabozantinib.\nEC approval for perioperative regimen of neoadjuvant\nand chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant\nfor the treatment of resectable NSCLC at high-risk of recurrence in adult patients whose tumors have PD-L1 expression ≥1%.\nas a first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC.\nas a first-line treatment of adult and pediatric patients (12 years and older) with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient CRC.\nJapan’s Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare approval of\nfor the treatment of oHCM.\nfor the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL after two or more lines of systemic therapy.\nfor the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or advanced HCC.\nas a treatment for adult patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC and for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with NTRK-positive solid tumors.\nRefer to \"—Product and Pipeline Developments\" for a listing of other developments in our marketed products and late-stage pipeline since the start of the third quarter of 2025.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements\nRefer to \"Item 1.
