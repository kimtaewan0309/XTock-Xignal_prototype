Linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide and is a major technological innovator in the industrial gases industry. Its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, and acetylene, etc.). The company also designs and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants.\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\nLinde’s sales were $33,005 million, $32,854 million, and $33,364 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Refer to\n, Management's Discussion and Analysis, for a discussion of consolidated sales and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Linde’s reportable segments.\nIndustrial Gases Products and Manufacturing Processes\nAtmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by Linde. Using ambient air as feedstock, Linde produces oxygen, nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent. Linde is the market leader in the field of non-cryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases. As part of this process Linde also produces rare gases, such as krypton, neon, and xenon. As a pioneer and leader in industrial gases, Linde is continuously developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and technologies to produce, store, distribute and increase usage of its gases. These technologies open important new markets and provide customers with opportunities to reduce costs, by increasing their operational efficiencies, including vacuum pressure swing adsorption (“VPSA”) and membrane separation technology to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen on-site.\nProcess gases, including hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, specialty gases and acetylene are produced by other production methods.\nHydrogen is produced from a range of different feedstocks using a wide portfolio of technologies. Today, carbon intensity is used to designate and differentiate between the production processes and the respective feedstocks used to produce the molecule. The majority of conventional hydrogen currently produced by Linde is derived from natural gas or methane, using steam methane reformation (SMR) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) technology. Linde has a range of technologies to produce low-carbon hydrogen from fossil feedstocks, or renewable hydrogen from renewable energy (non-fossil feedstock). Both products are considered sources of clean energy. Low-carbon (blue) hydrogen is produced primarily from methane, by capturing carbon emissions from a hydrogen production plant and sequestering them subsurface for the long term. Renewable (green) hydrogen is produced by electrolysis using renewable energy and water as feedstock. Other sources of low-carbon hydrogen are existing chemical and petrochemical processes, out of which Linde recovers hydrogen for subsequent treatment and cleaning to achieve ultra-high purity levels.\nCarbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming (SMR) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of natural gas or other feedstock such as naphtha, a by-product in the petrochemical industry. Most carbon dioxide comes as an industrial by-product, that is sourced from chemical plants, refineries and other processes or is recovered from natural carbon dioxide sources. Raw carbon dioxide is processed and purified in Linde’s plants to produce commercial and food-grade carbon dioxide. Helium is sourced from certain helium-rich natural gas streams in the United States, with additional supplies being acquired from outside the United States. Acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical by-product, but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water.\nIndustrial Gases Distribution\nThere are three basic distribution methods for industrial gases: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. These distribution methods are often integrated, with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant. The method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer’s needs, depending upon factors such as volume requirements, purity, pattern of usage, and the form in which the product is used (as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid).\nCustomers that require the largest volumes of product (typically oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen) and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Air separation technologies also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\nThe merchant business is generally associated with distributable liquid oxygen, nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, helium and carbon dioxide. The deliveries generally are made from Linde’s plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site which are usually owned and maintained by Linde and leased to the customer. Due to distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to seven-year requirement contracts.\nCustomers requiring small volumes are supplied products in metal containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Packaged gases include atmospheric gases, hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, acetylene and related products. Linde also produces and distributes in cylinders a wide range of specialty gases and mixtures. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and through purchase orders.\nLinde’s Engineering business has a global presence, with its focus on market segments such as air separation, hydrogen, synthesis, olefin and natural gas plants. The company utilizes its extensive process engineering expertise in the planning, design and construction of highly efficient plants for the production and processing of gases. With its state-of-the-art sustainable technologies Engineering also helps customers avoid, capture and utilize carbon dioxide emissions. Its technology portfolio covers the entire value chain for production, liquefaction, storage, distribution and application of hydrogen which supports the transition to clean energy. Its digital services and solutions increase plant efficiency and performance.\nLinde's plants are used in a wide variety of fields: in the petrochemical and chemical industries, in refineries and fertilizer plants, to recover air gases, to produce synthesis gases, to treat natural gas and to produce noble gases. The Engineering business either supplies plant components directly to the customer or to the industrial gas business of Linde which operates the plants under a long-term gases supply contract.\n– Linde carries inventories of merchant and cylinder gases and hardgoods to supply products to its customers on a reasonable delivery schedule. On-site plants and pipeline complexes have limited inventory.\nventory obsolescence is not material to Linde’s business.\n– Linde is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers.\n– Linde is a global enterprise with approximately 65% of its 2024 sales outside of the United States. The company also has majority or wholly owned subsidiaries that operate in approximately 45 European, Middle Eastern and African countries (including Germany, the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, Sweden, and the Republic of South Africa); approximately 20 Asian and South Pacific countries (including China, Australia, India and South Korea); and approximately 20 countries in North and South America (including U.S., Canada, Mexico and Brazil).\nThe company also has equity method investments operating in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\nLinde’s non-U.S. business is subject to risks customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, import and export controls, and other economic, political and regulatory policies of local governments. Also, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nLinde’s business is generally not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any significant extent.\nResearch and Development\n– Linde’s research and development is directed toward development of gas processing, separation and liquefaction technologies, and clean energy technologies; improving distribution of industrial gases and the development of new markets and applications for these gases. This results in the development of new advanced air separation, hydrogen, synthesis gas, natural gas, adsorption and chemical process technologies; novel clean energy and carbon management solutions; as well as the frequent introduction of new industrial gas applications. Research and\ndevelopment is primarily conducted in Pullach, Germany, Tonawanda, New York, Burr Ridge, Illinois and Shanghai, China.\nPatents and Trademarks\n– Linde owns or licenses a large number of patents that relate to a wide variety of products and processes. Linde’s patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. While these patents and licenses are considered important to its individual businesses, Linde does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any one particular patent, or patent license, or family of patents. Linde also owns a large number of trademarks, of which the \"Linde\" trademark is the most significant.\nRaw Materials and Energy Costs\n– Energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases. Most of Linde’s energy requirements are in the form of electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution. The company mitigates electricity, natural gas, and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, cost pass–through and tolling arrangements.\nThe supply of energy has not typically been a significant issue in the geographic areas where the company conducts business. However, energy availability and price is unpredictable and may pose future risks.\nFor hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and specialty gases, raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources. Linde has contracts or commitments for, or readily available sources of, most of these raw materials; however, their long-term availability and prices are subject to market conditions.\n– Linde participates in highly competitive markets in industrial gases and engineering, which are characterized by a mixture of local, regional and global players, all of which exert competitive pressure on the parties. In locations where Linde has pipeline networks, which enable the company to provide reliable a",
  "item7_clean": "year versus 2023. Sales grew 2% from higher price attainment. Volumes were flat, as new project start-ups were largely offset by base volume declines. Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers decreased sales by 1%, with minimal impact on operating profit. Currency translation decreased sales by 1%, primarily due to the weakening of the Brazilian real, Chinese yuan, and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased $349 million, or 2%, for the year primarily due to lower cost pass-through and productivity gains, which more than offset cost inflation. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was 51.9% and 53.2% of sales, in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher pricing and lower cost pass-through.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&A\") increased $42 million, or 1%, from $3,295 million in 2023 to $3,337 million in 2024 driven by higher costs. SG&A was 10.1% of sales in 2024 versus 10.0% in 2023. Currency impacts decreased SG&A by approximately $28 million in 2024.\nDepreciation and amortization\nReported depreciation and amortization expense decreased $36 million, or 1%, versus 2023. The decrease is due to lower depreciation and amortization of assets acquired in the merger partially offset by the net impact of new project start ups.\nOn an adjusted basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased $32 million, or 1%, versus 2023. Currency impacts decreased depreciation and amortization by $17 million in 2024. Excluding currency, underlying depreciation and amortization increased due to the net impact of new project start ups.\nCost reduction program and other charges\nCost reduction program and other charge\ns were $145 million and $40 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. 2024 includes severance charges of $165 million, other cost reduction charges of $23 million, and other benefit of $43 million related to a divestiture in APAC. In 2023, the costs primarily related to severance in the Engineering segment and expenses incurred due to the intercompany reorganization.\nOn an adjusted basis, these charges have been excluded in both periods.\nOther income (expense) - net\nReported other income (expense) - net was a benefit of $185 million in 2024 and expense of $41 million in 2023. In 2024, other income included a benefit of $41 million related to a settlement with a supplier in the Americas and $45 million in insurance recoveries primarily within the Other segment (Note 7).\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%. The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\nInterest expense - net\nReported interest expense – net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\nNet pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company’s uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\nIncome from equity investments\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\nNoncontrolling interests\nAt December 31, 2024, noncontrolling interests consisted primarily of noncontrolling shareholders’ investments in APAC (primarily in China). Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nNet Income - Linde plc\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\nDiluted earnings per share\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023,\ndriven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC\nOther Financial Data\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632 million partially offset by gains related to change in funded status of retirement plans of $519 million. The translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency\nforeign subsidiary financial statements to U.S. dollars, and are largely driven by the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the Euro, British pound and the Chinese yuan. See the \"Currency\" section of the MD&A for exchange rates used for translation purposes and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by segment.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe company’s related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates. The company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties.\nEnvironmental Matters\nLinde’s principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases, many of which are used to help customers reduce their emissions. Worldwide costs relating to environmental protection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations. In addition, Linde may face physical risks from climate change and extreme weather.\nLinde operates in jurisdictions that have, or are developing, laws and/or regulations to reduce or mitigate the adverse effects of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions and therefore faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area. Linde continues to evaluate ongoing regulatory changes and assess appropriate response. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") has promulgated rules requiring reporting of GHG emissions to which Linde, its suppliers and customers are subject to. EPA has also promulgated regulations to restrict GHG emissions, including final rules regulating GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities, including some of Linde’s suppliers and customers. In addition to these developments in the United States, several other countries worldwide have implemented carbon taxation or trading systems which impact the company and its customers, including regulations in China, Singapore and the European Union. Among other impacts, such regulations are expected to affect the cost of energy, which is a significant cost for Linde. Nevertheless, Linde's long-term customer contracts typically provide rights to recover increased electricity, natural gas, and other costs that are incurred by the company as a result of climate change regulation.\nLinde anticipates continued growth in hydrogen sales due to increased focus on decarbonization projects. Traditionally, hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity-generating plants have been identified as sources of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to cap-and-trade regulations in jurisdictions including California and the European Union. Linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts. However, legislation that limits GHG emissions may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and/or decreasing demand.\nTo manage business risks from current and potential GHG emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change, Linde actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. Among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; maintaining contingency plans; obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating GHG provisions in commercial agreements; and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. Although there are considerable uncertainties, Linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. Additionally, Linde’s plant design, operations, and risk management teams are engaged to manage and mitigate losses from physical climate change, and the company does not anticipate material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change.\nLinde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and GHG emissions through research and development in customer applications and operational energy efficiency, sourcing low-carbon source energy, and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible. Linde tracks GHG emission performance versus targets and reports regularly to business management and annually to Linde's Board of Directors. The Sustainability Committee is responsible for oversight of the Company's programs and policies related to environmental matters, including climate change, greenhouse gas reduction goals and decarbonization solutions, such as clean energy and carbon management.\nAt the same time, external factors may provide Linde with future business opportunities. Examples include current legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S., which provides for investments in production of clean hydrogen and decarbonization technologies. Other factors include governmental regulation of GHG and other emissions; uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources; the development of renewable energy alternatives; and new technologies that help extract natural gas, improve air quality, increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Linde\ncontinues to develop new applications that can help customers lower emissions by reducing energy consumption and increasing product throughput. Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. can create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\nCosts Relating to the Protection of the Environment\nThe environmental protection costs incurred in 2024 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2024, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations. Based on historical results and current estimates, management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.\nThe net periodic benefit cost (benefit) was a benefit of $106 million, $80 million and $110 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe funded status (pension benefit obligation (\"PBO\") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a surplus of $86 million and deficit of $137 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The funded status for non-U.S. plans was a surplus of $464 million and deficit of $207 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024, the U.S. and non U.S plans derived a benefit from actuarial gains due to higher discount rate environment.\nGlobal pension contributions were $35 million in 2024, $46 million in 2023, and $51 million in 2022. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the U.S.). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2025 are currently expected to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million.\nLinde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2025 of 7.00% and\n\nCash flows from operations was $9,423 million, an increase of $118 million from 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net income, which was partially offset by higher net working capital requirements, including lower inflows for contract liabilities from engineering customer advance payments, and higher cash taxes.\nNet cash used for investing activities was $4,644 million in 2024 compared to $4,670 million in 2023. The decrease was due to lower acquisition spend and higher proceeds from divestiture and asset sales, which more than offset higher capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures in 2024 were $4,497 million, an increase of $710 million from 2023. Capital expenditures during 2024 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for backlog growth requirements.\nApproximately 58% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 22% in the APAC segment and the rest largely in the EMEA segment.\nAt De",
