Also contributing to the decrease in earnings in the steel mills segment in 2024 as compared to 2023 was the increase in pre-operating and start-up costs related to several growth investments that are in various stages of construction or start-up within the segment. Earnings in the raw materials segment decreased in 2024 as compared to 2023 due to the decreased profitability of DJJ’s scrap processing operations and the impact of an $83 million impairment charge of a long-term note receivable that management determined was no longer collectible.\n\nNucor management considerations include maintaining an appropriate balance of spot and contract tons based on market projections and appropriately supporting our diversified customer base. The percentage of tons that is placed under contract also depends on the overall market dynamics and customer negotiations. In years of strengthening demand, we typically see an increase in the percentage of sheet sales sold under contract as our customers have an expectation that transaction prices will rapidly rise, and available capacity will quickly be sold out. To mitigate this risk, customers prefer to enter into contracts in order to obtain committed volumes of supply from the mills. The vast majority of our contracts include a method of adjusting prices on a periodic basis to reflect changes in the market pricing for steel and/or scrap. Market indices for steel generally trend with scrap pricing changes, but, during periods of steel market weakness, the more intensified competitive steel market environment can cause the sales price indices to decrease resulting in reduced gross margins and profitability. Furthermore, since the selling price adjustments are not immediate, there will always be a timing difference between changes in the prices we pay for raw materials and the adjustments we make to our contract selling prices. Contract sales typically have terms ranging from six to 12 months.\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the valuation allowances for receivables, the carrying value of non-current assets and reserves for environmental obligations and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Accordingly, actual costs could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe also focus on both dollar and percentage changes in gross margins, which are key drivers of our profitability, and the reasons for such changes. There are many factors from period to period that can affect our gross margins. One consistent area of focus for us is changes in “metal margins,” which is the difference between the selling price of steel and the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes. Increases or decreases in the cost of scrap and scrap substitutes that are not offset by changes in the selling price of steel can quickly compress or expand our margins and reduce or increase our profitability.\n\nA major component of marketing, administrative and other expenses is profit sharing and other incentive compensation costs. These costs, which are based upon and fluctuate with Nucor’s financial performance, decreased from 2023 to 2024 due to the decreased profitability of the Company. In 2024, profit sharing costs consisted of $298 million, including the Company’s matching contribution, made to the Company’s Profit Sharing and Retirement Savings Plan for qualified employees ($611 million in 2023). Other employee bonus costs also fluctuate based on Nucor’s achievement of certain financial performance goals, including achieving record earnings, and comparisons of Nucor’s financial performance to peers in the steel industry and other companies. Stock-based compensation included in marketing, administrative and other expenses decreased by 4% to $52 million in 2024 compared with $54 million in 2023 and includes expenses associated with vesting of stock awards granted in prior years.\n\nDuring periods of stronger or rapidly improving steel market conditions, we are more likely to be able to pass through to our customers, relatively quickly, the increased costs of ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes, protecting our gross margins from significant erosion. During periods of weaker or rapidly deteriorating steel market conditions, weak steel demand, low industry utilization rates and the impact of imports create an even more intensified competitive environment and increased pricing pressure. All of those factors, to some degree, impact pricing, which increases the likelihood that Nucor will experience lower gross margins.\n\nGross margins in the steel mills segment decreased 2024 compared to 2023 due to decreased metal margins. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per gross ton used decreased 6% from $421 in 2023 to $394 in 2024. Despite the decrease in average scrap and scrap substitute costs in 2024 compared to 2023, metal margins decreased as the decrease in average selling prices was greater than the decrease in average scrap and scrap substitute costs.\nScrap prices are driven by the global supply and demand for scrap and other iron-based raw materials used to make steel. Scrap prices are stable as we begin 2025.\n\nis necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. In these instances, a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the current estimated fair value of these reporting units. Significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit as part of our annual testing (and any required interim testing) include: (i) expected cash flow for the five-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, raw materials and other costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (ii) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; (iii) a discount rate based on management’s best estimate of the after-tax weighted-average cost of capital; and (iv) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to certain scenarios based on the likelihood of occurrence. Management considers historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. Those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate.\n\nChanges in marketing, administrative and other expenses, particularly profit sharing and other variable incentive-based payment costs, can have a material effect on our results of operations for a reporting period as well. These costs vary significantly from period to period as they are based upon changes in our pre-tax earnings and other profitability metrics that are a reflection of our pay-for-performance system that is closely tied to our levels of production.\n\nKey assumptions used to determine the fair value of our equity method investments include: (i) expected cash flow for the five-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, raw materials and other costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (ii) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the investment; (iii) a discount rate based on management’s best estimate of the after-tax weighted-average cost of capital; and (iv) a probability-weighted scenario approach by which varying cash flows are assigned to certain scenarios based on the likelihood of occurrence. Management considers historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its investments are estimated. Those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate.\n\nAn uncertainty we continue to face in our business is the price of our principal raw material, ferrous scrap, which is volatile and often increases or decreases rapidly in response to changes in domestic demand, unanticipated events that affect the flow of scrap into scrap yards, the availability of scrap substitutes, currency fluctuations and changes in foreign demand for scrap. In periods of rapidly increasing raw material prices in the industry, which are often also associated with periods of stronger or rapidly improving steel market conditions, being able to increase our prices for the products we sell quickly enough to offset increases in the prices we pay for ferrous scrap is challenging but critical to maintaining our profitability. We attempt to mitigate the scrap price risk by managing scrap inventory levels at the steel mills to match the anticipated demand over the next several weeks. Certain scrap\n\nPre-operating and start-up costs of new facilities increased to approximately $594 million in 2024 as compared to approximately $400 million in 2023. Pre-operating and start-up costs in 2024 primarily related to the plate mill in Kentucky, the sheet mill being built in West Virginia, and the melt shop being built in Arizona. Pre-operating and start-up costs in 2023 primarily related to the plate mill then being built in Kentucky, the sheet mill being built in West Virginia, and the micro mill being built in North Carolina. Nucor defines pre-operating and start-up costs, all of which are expensed, as the losses attributable to facilities or major projects that are either under construction or in the early stages of operation. Once these facilities or projects have attained a utilization rate that is consistent with our similar operating facilities, they are no longer considered by Nucor to be in start-up.\n\nThe primary uses of cash were: (i) stock repurchases of $2.22 billion in 2024 as compared to $1.55 billion in 2023, an increase of $663 million; (ii) cash dividends to stockholders of $522 million in 2024 as compared to $515 million in 2023; and (iii) distributions to noncontrolling interests of $352 million in 2024 as compared to $435 million in 2023, a decrease of $83 million. In 2022, Nucor issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes, $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes, $550 million aggregate principal amount of the 2032 Notes and $550 million aggregate principal amount of the 2052 Notes. On April 25, 2022, Nucor redeemed all $500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2023 Notes. On August 15, 2022, Nucor redeemed all $600 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2022 Notes.\n\nrates; (10) significant changes in laws or government regulations affecting environmental compliance, including legislation and regulations that result in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that could increase our energy costs, capital expenditures and operating costs or cause one or more of our permits to be revoked or make it more difficult to obtain permit modifications; (11) the cyclical nature of the steel industry; (12) capital investments and their impact on our performance; (13) our safety performance; (14) our ability to integrate businesses we acquire; (15) the impact of any pandemic or public health situation; and (16) the risks discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this report.\n\nOur fourth quarter 2024 annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge. Management does not believe that future impairment of these reporting units is probable. However, the performance of certain businesses that comprise our reporting units requires continued improvement. An increase of approximately 50 basis points in the discount rate, a critical assumption in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value, would not result in an impairment charge. See Note 8 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the results of the Company’s 2024 annual goodwill impairment analysis.\n\nFor 2024 compared to 2023, the $3.13 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease in net earnings and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net earnings decreased $2.59 billion over the prior year, which included $137 million of non-cash losses and impairments of assets in 2024 (none in 2023). The changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net inflow of $156 million and $858 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The changes in working capital were primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories from year-end 2023 to year-end 2024. Accounts receivable at the end of 2024 decreased from the prior year-end resulting in a cash inflow of $319 million due to a decrease in the sales volumes and price per ton compared to the prior year. From year-end 2023 to year-end 2024, inventories decreased resulting in an inflow of $518 million due primarily to an 18% decrease in raw material tons. This compares to inventories at year-end 2023 increasing from year-end 2022 and resulting in a $75 million cash outflow. Salaries, wages and related accruals decreased $385 million due to lower current year profit sharing accrual and other benefit related accruals. Accounts payable decreased resulting in a $321 million cash outflow due to the decreases in inventory mentioned previously.\n\nWe evaluate our property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment on an individual asset basis or at the lowest level asset grouping for which cash flows can be independently identified. Asset impairments are assessed whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of those productive assets could exceed their projected undiscounted cash flows. In developing estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations, we utilize judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce. When it is determined that an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to estimated fair market value. Certain long-lived asset groupings were tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2024. Undiscounted cash flows for each asset grouping were estimated using management’s long-range estimates of market conditions associated with each asset grouping over the estimated useful life of the principal asset within the group. Our undiscounted cash flow analysis indicated that the tested long-lived asset groupings were recoverable as of December 31, 2024. Management determined that no long-lived asset impairment testing was required in 2023.\n\nInvestments in joint ventures in which Nucor shares control over the financial and operating decisions but in which Nucor is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method. Each of the Company’s equity method investments is subject to a review for impairment if, and when",
