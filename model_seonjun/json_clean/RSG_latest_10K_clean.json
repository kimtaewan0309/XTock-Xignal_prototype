  "item1_clean": "Our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local requirements that regulate, among other things, the environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use. Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations, recycling centers, certain waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and other equipment and facilities that we own or operate. These permits are subject to denial, revocation, modification and renewal in certain circumstances. Any revocation, modification or denial of permits could have a material\nadverse effect on us. Federal, state and local laws and regulations vary, but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges, air emissions, the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement, which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits, obtain injunctions, or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations, including criminal penalties. The United States EPA and various other federal, state, provincial and local authorities administer these regulations. Regulations with respect to hazardous waste are particularly relevant for our Group 3 reportable segment that provides treatment, recycling and disposal of hazardous waste.\nIn order to comply with these regulations, we must incur substantial capital expenditures relating to our vehicles, landfills, transfer stations, recycling centers and other assets, and in connection with our capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities. Compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements, including changes relating to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (commonly referred to as PFAS) and other chemicals of emerging concern, and limitations or bans on disposal of certain types of wastes or on the transportation of waste, could increase our costs to operate or require additional capital expenditures.\nA decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry for our competitors. Further, we compete with counties and municipalities that operate their own collection and disposal facilities, and have the benefits of tax revenue and greater opportunities for tax-exempt financing.\nWe strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and permits. However, from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines, penalties or settlements. Citations and notices may be issued in the future, notwithstanding our strong regulatory compliance efforts. We have established final capping, closure, post-closure and remediation reserves that we believe, based on currently available information, will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs; however, actual costs may exceed our reserves.\nThe following summarizes the primary federal, environmental and occupational health and safety-related statutes that affect our facilities and operations:\nThe Solid Waste Disposal Act, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\n(RCRA). RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste, and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills.\nSubtitle C of RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of hazardous waste, and Subtitle D of RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste. Regulations under Subtitle C set requirements for hazardous waste generators, transporters and treatment, storage and disposal facilities. Regulations under Subtitle D currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines, including location restrictions, facility design and operating criteria, final capping, closure and post-closure requirements, financial assurance standards, groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards. The EPA may authorize states to implement certain hazardous waste requirements of Subtitle C, and if a state program does not exist, the EPA directly implements the hazardous waste requirements. Nearly all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to RCRA and Subtitles C and D. These state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of Subtitles C and D. Our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit, which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits, reduced revenue from lost operational time and increased third party disposal costs.\nAll of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed Subtitles C and D requirements, as applicable. Operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations. Compliance with Subtitles C and D regulations has resulted in increased capital expenditures and operating costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities.\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980\n(CERCLA). CERCLA, among other things, provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment. CERCLA may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site, parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of, parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site. Under the authority of CERCLA and its implementing regulations, detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of\nfacilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only hazardous wastes, but also can be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700 substances currently characterized by the EPA as hazardous, many of which are found in common household waste. The EPA may also designate additional substances as hazardous; in 2024, the EPA finalized a rule that designated two PFAS as hazardous substances. Among other things, CERCLA authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment, or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves. In addition, the EPA has established a National Priorities List of sites at which hazardous substances have been, or are threatened to be, released and which require investigation or cleanup.\nCERCLA liability is strict liability. It can be founded upon the release or threatened release, even as a result of unintentional, non-negligent or lawful action, of hazardous substances, including very small quantities of such substances. Thus, even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances, it is possible that hazardous substances have been deposited or released at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated, or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste. Therefore, we could be liable under CERCLA for the cost of cleaning up, or protecting against the release of, such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources, even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them. The costs of a CERCLA cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriately-licensed facilities. Given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability, any such liability could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972\n(the Clean Water Act). This act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources, including solid waste disposal sites, into streams, rivers and other waters of the United States. Runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters through discrete conveyances must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under certain circumstances, to reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. Storm water discharge regulations under the Clean Water Act require a permit for certain construction activities and for runoff from industrial operations and facilities, which may affect our operations. If a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly-owned treatment works, the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works. In addition, states may adopt groundwater protection programs under the Clean Water Act or the Safe Drinking Water Act that could affect the manner in which our landfills monitor and control their waste management activities. Furthermore, if development at any of our facilities alters or affects wetlands, we may be required to secure permits before such development starts. In these situations, permitting agencies may require mitigation of wetland impacts.\nThe Clean Air Act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources, including landfills. In 1996, the EPA promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems along with landfill gas control systems unless emissions are below established thresholds. These regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction or modification on or after May 30, 1991, and, principally, to landfills that can accommodate 2.5 million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste. The regulations apply whether the landfills are active or closed. The date by which each affected landfill must have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill. In July 2016, the EPA issued final amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or after July 17, 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain non-methane gases, which are recognized as greenhouse gases. In a separate rule finalized at the same time, the EPA issued updates to its 1996 Emission Guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills. Both actions were part of the Obama Administration's Climate Action Plan - Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions. As part of the Biden Administration's focus on climate change, the EPA has taken further steps to implement these regulations. These and other efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems, with resulting capital or operating costs.

We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from some of our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized due to limitations on these loss carryforwards in certain states. In recognition of this risk, as of December 31, 2024, we have provided a valuation allowance of\nFor additional discussion and detail regarding our income taxes, see Note 11,\nOur senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through three field groups, referred to as Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3. Group 1 is our recycling and waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the western United States. Group 2 is our recycling and waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the southeastern and mid-western United States, the eastern seaboard of the United States, and Canada. Group 3 is our environmental solutions business operating primarily in geographic areas located across the United States and Canada. These groups are presented below as our reportable segments, which each provide integrated environmental services, including but not limited to collection, transfer, recycling and disposal.\nCorporate entities and other include marketing, operations support, business development, legal, tax, treasury, information technology, risk management, human resources and other administrative functions. National Accounts revenue included in Corporate entities and other represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide and regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations. Revenue and overhead costs of Corporate entities and other are either specifically assigned or allocated on a rational and consistent basis among our reportable segments to calculate adjusted EBITDA by reportable segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA is the single financial measure our chief operating decision maker (CODM) uses to evaluate operating segment profitability and determine resource allocations. Cost of operations and selling, general and administrative are significant segment expenses used in the evaluation. Summarized financial information regarding our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions of dollars) follows. For totals as well as further detail regarding our reportable segments and the adjustments used to calculate adjusted EBITDA for each segment, see Note 15,\nRecycling & Waste Subtotal\n(Environmental Solutions)\nCorporate entities and other\nIntercompany Revenue\nSG&A\nCapital Expenditures\nRecycling & Waste Subtotal(1)\n(Environmental Solutions)\nCorporate entities and other\nIntercompany Revenue\nSG&A\nCapital Expenditures\n(1) The Recycling & Waste Subtotal represents the combined results of our Group 1 and Group 2 reportable segments.\nSignificant changes in the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of our reportable segments for 2024 compared to 2023 are discussed below.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Group 1 increased from $2,135 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $2,353 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe most significant items impacting adjusted EBITDA in Group 1 during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 include:\nNet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 7.9% from 2023 due to an increase in average yield in all lines of business partially offset by volume declines in our large container collection and landfill lines of business.\nCost of operations increased due to an increase in labor and third party maintenance costs due to inflationary pressures. The unfavorable impact was partially offset by decreases in fuel costs due to a decrease in average fuel cost per gallon.\nTotal assets increased primarily due to additions in property and equipment.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Group 2 increased from $1,964 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $2,190 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2024.\nThe most significant items impacting adjusted EBITDA in Group 2 during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 include:\nNet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 4.9% from 2023 due to an increase in average yield in all lines of business and increased volume in our landfill line of business. These increases were partially offset by decreased volume in our collection and transfer lines of business.\nCost of operations increased due to an increase in labor and maintenance costs due to inflationary pressures. The unfavorable impact was partially offset by decreases in fuel costs due to a decrease in average fuel cost per gallon.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Group 3 increased from $348 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $436 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe most significant items impacting adjusted EBITDA in Group 3 during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 include:\nNet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased due to acquisition-related growth, favorable pricing, and an increase in event-based volumes.\nCost of operations increased primarily due to an increase in labor costs and the impact of acquisitions.\nLandfill and Environmental Matters\nOur landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure and post-closure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses include leachate treatment, transportation and disposal costs, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance costs, interim cap maintenance costs and costs associated with applying daily cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the units-of-consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site, including excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the site. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post-closure are capitalized and amortized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed.\nCost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. Our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in cost estimates, available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted. Changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information.\n, we owned or operated 208 active landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 5 billion in-place cubic yards. For these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity and remaining capacity, as measured in cubic yards of airspace as of\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\nCubic yards (in millions):\nProbable expansion airspace\nTotal cubic yards (in millions)\nProbable expansion airspace\nThe following table reflects changes in capacity and remaining capacity for these landfills, as measured in cubic yards of airspace, as of December 31, 2023\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nCubic yards (in millions):\nProbable expansion airspace\nTotal cubic yards (in millions)\nProbable expansion airspace\nTotal available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. Engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion criteria. See Note 2,\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\nLandfill and Environmental Costs\nCritical Accounting Judgments and Estimates\nsection of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, 14 of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes, these 14 landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 49 years, including probable expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 56 years. We have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace.\nThe following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of December 31, 2024:\nFinal Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs\nRemediation and Other Charges for Landfill Matters\nIt is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust our accrued landfill and environmental liabilities to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent that such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor a description of our significant remediation matters, see Note 8,\nLandfill and Environmental Costs,\nInvestment in Landfills\nAs of December 31, 2024, we expect to spend an estimated additional $12 billion on existing landfills, primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures, over their remaining lives. Our total expected investment, excluding non-depletable land, estimated to be\nper cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the units-of-consumption method.\nThe following table reflects our future expected investment as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\nNon-depletable landfill land\nLandfill development costs\nConstruction-in-progress – landfill\nAccumulated depletion and amortization\nNet investment in landfill land and development costs\nThe following table reflects our net investment in our landfills, excluding non-depletable land, and our depletion, amortization and accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nNumber of landfills owned or operated\nNet investment, excluding non-depletable land (in millions)\nTotal estimated available disposal capacity (in millions of cubic yards)\nNet investment per cubic yard\nLandfill depletion and amortization expense (in millions)\nAccretion expense (in millions)\nAirspace consumed (in millions of cubic yards)\nDepletion, amortization and accretion expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed\nDuring 2024 and 2023, our average compaction rate was approximately 2,000 pounds per cubic yard based primarily on a three-year historical moving average.\nProperty and Equipment\nThe following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the year ended December 31, 2024 (in millions of dollars):\nGross Property and Equipment\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\nLandfill development costs\nVehicles and equipment\nBuildings and improvements\nConstruction-in-progress - landfill\nConstruction-in-progress - other\nAccumulated Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\nLandfill development costs\nVehicles and equipment\nBuildings and improvements\nThe following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the year ended December 31, 2023 (in millions of dollars):\nGross Property and Equipment\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nLandfill development costs\nVehicles and equipment\nBuildings and improvements\nConstruction-in-progress - landfill\nConstruction-in-progress - other\nAccumulated Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nLandfill development costs\nVehicles and equipment\nBuildings and improvements\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and marketable securities balances as of December 31:\nCash and cash equivalents\nRestricted cash and marketable securities\nLess: restricted marketable securities\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents\nOur restricted cash and marketable securities include amounts pledged to regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts and permits, and relating to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations at our landfills as well as restricted cash and marketable securities related to our insurance obligations.\nThe following table summarizes our restricted cash and marketable securities as of December 31:\nCapping, closure and post-closure obligations\nTotal restricted cash and marketable securities\nMaterial Cash Requirements and Intended Uses of Cash\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
