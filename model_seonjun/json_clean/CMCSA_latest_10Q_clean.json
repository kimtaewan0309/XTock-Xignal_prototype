International Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships represent customers receiving Sky services in the United Kingdom and Italy. Because each of our services includes a variety of product tiers, which may change from time to time, net additions or losses in any one period will reflect a mix of customers at various tiers.\nBusiness Services Connectivity customer metrics are generally counted based on the number of connections receiving services, including connections within our network in the United States, as well as connections outside of our network both in the United States and internationally. Certain arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our network are also generally counted based on the number of connections served.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, Business Services Connectivity customer relationships and Domestic Broadband Business customers include connections from the acquisition of Nitel and other conforming changes, resulting in an increase of 124,000 Business Services Connectivity customer relationships and 123,000 domestic broadband business customers as of April 1, 2025. Because these adjustments were made as of April 1, 2025, they are not reflected in prior period customer metrics or in net additions/(losses) in prior and current year periods.\nDomestic wireless lines represent the number of residential and business customers\nwireless devices. An individual customer relationship may have multiple wireless lines.\nConnectivity & Platforms domestic homes and businesses are considered passed if we can connect them to our network in the United States without further extending the transmission lines. Homes and businesses passed is an estimate based on the best available information.\nPenetration is calculated by dividing the number of domestic customers located within our network by the number of domestic homes and businesses passed.\nConstant Currency Change\nConstant Currency Change\nAverage monthly total Connectivity & Platforms revenue per customer relationship\nAverage monthly total Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship\nConstant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 24 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of constant currency amounts.\nAverage monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business customers, as well as changes in advertising and other revenue and in foreign currency exchange rates. While revenue from our individual service offerings is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses.\nConnectivity & Platforms — Supplemental Costs and Expenses Information\nConnectivity & Platforms supplemental costs and expenses information in the table below is presented on an aggregate basis across the Connectivity & Platforms segments as the segments use certain shared infrastructure, including our network in the United States. Costs and expenses information reported separately for the Residential Connectivity & Platforms and Business Services Connectivity segments includes each segment’s direct costs and an allocation of shared costs.\n\nDomestic advertising revenue\ndecreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to the Paris Olympics in the third quarter of 2024. Excluding the incremental revenue associated with this event, domestic advertising revenue increased for the three months ended September 30, 2025 primarily due to an increase in revenue at Peacock, and it decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily due to a decrease in revenue at our linear television networks, partially offset by an increase in revenue at Peacock.\nDomestic distribution revenue\ndecreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to the Paris Olympics in the third quarter of 2024. Excluding the incremental revenue associated with this event, domestic distribution revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily due to increases in revenue at Peacock, partially offset by decreases in revenue at our linear television networks. The decreases at our linear television networks were primarily due to declines in the number of subscribers, partially offset by contractual rate increases.\nInternational networks revenue\nincreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to increases in revenue associated with the distribution of sports networks and the positive impact of foreign currency.\nMedia segment total revenue included $1.4 billion and $3.8 billion related to Peacock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively. Media segment total revenue included $1.5 billion and $3.6 billion related to Peacock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, including amounts related to the Paris Olympics. We had 41 million and 36 million paid subscribers of Peacock as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Peacock paid subscribers represent customers from which we recognize distribution revenue, including both customers that pay us directly and customers receiving the service through arrangements with companies who sell Peacock on our behalf. In these arrangements, paid subscribers are counted based on the terms of the arrangement when the related revenue is recognized. As a result, certain customers are counted when they activate their account, while other customers are counted when the Peacock service is made available to them as part of their bundled service offering regardless of whether it is activated. The increase in paid subscribers in 2025 is mainly due to the availability of Peacock through a third-party’s bundled service offering.\nMedia Segment – Costs and Expenses\nProgramming and production costs\ndecreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to costs associated with the Paris Olympics in the prior year period and a decrease in other sports programming costs at our domestic television networks, mainly reflecting lower sports volumes compared to the prior year period. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sports programming costs for our international television networks.\nProgramming and production costs decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to costs associated with the Paris Olympics in the prior year period, a decrease in other sports programming costs at our domestic television networks, mainly reflecting lower sports volumes compared to the prior year period, and lower programming costs at Peacock. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sports programming costs for our international television networks and an increase in entertainment content costs for our domestic television networks.\nMarketing and promotion expenses\ndecreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to costs associated with the Paris Olympics in the prior year periods and lower costs related to marketing for Peacock.\nMedia segment total costs and expenses included $1.6 billion and\n\nMedia Segment – Revenue\nRevenue decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to the Paris Olympics in the third quarter of 2024. Excluding incremental revenue associated with the Paris Olympics, revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased primarily due to increases in international networks, domestic advertising and domestic distribution revenue. Excluding incremental revenue associated with the Paris Olympics, revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased primarily due to increases in international networks and domestic distribution revenue, partially offset by a decrease in domestic advertising revenue.\n\nPercentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.
