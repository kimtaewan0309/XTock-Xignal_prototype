We distribute natural gas through sales and transportation arrangements to over 3.3 million residential, commercial, public authority, and industrial customers throughout our six distribution divisions, which at June 30, 2025 covered service areas located in eight states. In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our distribution and pipeline systems.\nWe manage and review our consolidated operations through the following reportable segments:\ndistribution segment\nis comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states.\npipeline and storage segment\nis comprised primarily of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana.\nOur vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services. Our commitment to this vision requires significant levels of capital spending to modernize our natural gas distribution system and operating costs to deliver natural gas safely and reliably and in full compliance with the various safety regulations impacting our business. We have the ability to begin recovering a significant portion of our expenditures timely through rate designs and mechanisms that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns. The execution of our capital spending program, the ability to recover these expenditures timely, and our ability to access the capital markets to satisfy our financing needs are the primary drivers that affect our financial performance.\nWe anticipate making significant capital expenditures for the foreseeable future to modernize our distribution and transmission system, to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas in which we operate, and to prepare to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve. Between fiscal years 2025 and 2029, we anticipate spending approximately $24 billion, with more than 80 percent dedicated to safety and reliability spending. The magnitude and allocation of these expenditures may be affected by factors such as new policy and regulations, population growth, and increased labor and materials costs. Although we believe these costs are ultimately recoverable through our rates based on the regulatory frameworks currently available to us, full recovery is not assured.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes, and the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Actual results may differ from such estimates.\nPension and other postretirement plans\nOur critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. There were no significant changes to these critical accounting policies during the nine months ended June 30, 2025.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2025, we recorded net income of $1,023.9 million, or $6.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $908.9 million, or $6.00 per diluted share for the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\nThe 13 percent year-over-year increase in net income largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending, partially offset by higher bad debt expense, depreciation and property tax expenses, and higher spending on certain operating expenses.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2025, we implemented, or received approval to implement, ratemaking regulatory actions which resulted in an increase in annual operating income of $321.8 million. Additionally, as of June 30, 2025, we had ratemaking efforts in progress seeking a total increase in annual operating income of $248.7 million.\nCapital expenditures for the nine months ended June 30, 2025 were $2,597.8 million. Approximately 86 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation systems, with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce lag to six months or less.\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2025, we completed approximately $1.7 billion of long-term debt and equity financing. As of June 30, 2025, our equity capitalization was 60.0 percent. As of June 30, 2025, we had approximately $5.5 billion in total liquidity, consisting of $709.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $1,684.4 million in funds available through equity forward sales agreements and $3,094.4 million in undrawn capacity under our credit facilities.\nThe following discusses the results of operations for each of our operating segments.\nDistribution Segment\nThe distribution segment is comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states. The primary factors that impact the results of this segment are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, competitive factors in the energy industry, and economic conditions in our service areas.\nOur ability to earn our authorized rates of return is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and, ultimately, separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. Under our current rate design, approximately 70 percent of our distribution segment revenues are earned through the first six months of the fiscal year. Additionally, we currently recover approximately 50 percent of our distribution segment revenue, excluding gas costs, through the base customer charge, which partially separates the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns.\nSeasonal weather patterns can also affect our distribution operations. However, the effect of weather that is above or below normal is substantially offset through weather normalization adjustments, known as WNA, which have been approved by state regulatory commissions for approximately 97 percent of our residential and commercial revenues in the following states for the following time periods:\nKentucky, Mississippi, Mid-Tex\nOur distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas. We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; therefore, increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Revenues in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income.\nThe cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our operating income because these costs are recovered through our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. However, higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense. This risk is currently mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 89 percent of our residential and commercial revenues. Additionally, higher gas costs may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities, resulting in higher interest expense. Finally, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources.\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2025 compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2024\nFinancial and operational highlights for our distribution segment for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 are presented below.\n\n(In thousands, unless otherwise noted)\nOther non-operating income\nIncome before income taxes\nConsolidated distribution sales volumes — MMcf\nConsolidated distribution transportation volumes — MMcf\nTotal consolidated distribution throughput — MMcf\nConsolidated distribution average cost of gas per Mcf sold\nOperating income for our distribution segment increased 14.9 percent. Key drivers for the change in operating income include:\na $33.4 million increase in rate adjustments, primarily in our Mid-Tex Division.\na $7.2 million increase related to residential customer growth, primarily in our Mid-Tex Division, and increased industrial load.\nan $8.1 million decrease in refunds of excess deferred taxes to customers, which is substantially offset in income tax expense.\nPartially offset by:\na $19.2 million increase in depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments.\na $4.9 million increase in employee-related costs primarily due to "
