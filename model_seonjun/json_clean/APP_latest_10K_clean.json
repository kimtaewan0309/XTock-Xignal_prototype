  "item1_clean": "We calculate daily active users as the average number of unique device identities that open a mobile app (whether that mobile app our own or a third party’s) which has our software development kit (SDK) on each day in a period. We measure this figure through our SDK. An individual who uses an app in more than one country on a particular day will be counted as more than one unique device identity; however, if an individual uses more than one app in the same day, such individual is only counted once. This figure does not include any users who have opted out of allowing apps to track on their mobile phone\nOur system is built around optimizing to the advertisers revenue so our algorithms automatically adjust based on the likelihood users will engage.

Our studios have developed and published games across a number of genres including: casual, match-three, card/casino, mid-core, and hyper-casual. A large portion of our portfolio are casual, match-three and card/casino games that have a lower risk of development and generally have more predictable revenue streams and return. These games can be played a few minutes at a time and appeal to a wide range of users across many highly attractive demographics. Our studios leverage live ops to quickly iterate and increase in-game monetization by optimizing app economies and improving in-game conversion on items and offers. The studios operating our portfolio of Apps utilize our Advertising solutions to market, scale, and monetize our Apps.\nOn February 12, 2025, we announced that we had entered into a term sheet for the sale of our mobile gaming business to a privately held company for total consideration of $900.0 million, consisting of $400.0 million in shares of the acquirer’s common equity and $500.0 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. For additional information, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments\".\nOur Strategy for Growth\nWe have a comprehensive strategy to continue our growth and further enhance our market position in the advertising ecosystem:\nExisting market expansion:\nWe continue to have an attractive market opportunity within our current mobile app segment, which we intend to address through the optimization of our Advertising solutions.\nEnhance and extend AI-based technologies:\nAs we increase our scale and reach, our customers benefit from compounding improvements to AXON, our AI-powered advertising engine, which in turn improves the efficacy and growth of our Advertising solutions.\nNew market expansion:\nWe are confident our technology and expertise are applicable to other market segments and geographies we have not historically addressed, including:\nNon-gaming mobile app segments and industries:\nOne of our long-term objectives is to provide critical tools to mobile app developers across multiple verticals, including, for example, e-commerce and social media. We have made our Advertising solutions available to e-commerce advertisers, and while we are early in this market expansion, our e-commerce customers to date have experienced positive results, demonstrating the flexibility and future growth potential of our Advertising solutions.\nOther content industries:\nWe believe our deep expertise and capabilities will allow us to successfully apply our solutions to tangential sectors, including with mobile OEMs and carriers through our Array product initiative, as well as the growing CTV industry through Wurl. We continue to expand our CTV business through the addition of new content advertisers and supply channels as well as through the application of AXON to CTV.\nIndustry partnerships:\nWe plan to further invest in our sales and marketing teams to increase penetration among new and existing clients, including in expansion markets we are targeting.\nAttracting and retaining the best talent:\nOur employees are at the core of our technology and success. We intend to continue to invest in attracting and retaining exceptional talent who share our values and will drive our future growth.\nPursue strategic investments and partnerships:\nGiven our proven track record in strategic transactions, and our long-standing relationships with key industry players, we have earned a reputation as a partner of choice, and will continue to consider and leverage strategic acquisitions, partnerships, and investment opportunities to accelerate our growth.\nOur Customers and Developer Community\nOur globally diverse customers range from the largest enterprises to small and independent businesses and individuals across a variety of industries. Our customers comprise multiple groups within the advertising ecosystem including advertisers leveraging our platform to find users and advertising networks using our mediation solution to purchase advertising inventory. Our Apps also work with advertising networks who purchase advertising inventory and consumers who purchase in-app products. We also work with the mobile app publisher community who leverage our mediation solution to monetize their advertising inventory. The scale and breadth of our customers in terms of size and industry provides us with a competitive advantage.\nWe operate in a fragmented advertising ecosystem composed of divisions of large, well-established companies as well as privately-held companies. The large companies in our advertising and mobile app ecosystems may play multiple different roles given the breadth of their businesses.\nAdvertisers typically engage with several advertising platforms and networks to purchase advertisements on mobile apps, devices, and on CTV, looking to optimize their marketing investments. Such advertising companies vary in size and include Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Unity Software, as well as various private companies, several of which are also our partners and clients.\nThere are many companies that develop online and mobile games and other mobile apps. The larger gaming companies in our gaming ecosystem include Activision Blizzard (Microsoft), Tencent, and Zynga (Take-Two Interactive), as well as other public and private companies, many of which are also our partners and clients. We also expect new developers to enter the market and existing companies to allocate more resources to develop and market more mobile games and apps.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are:\nthe ability to enhance and improve technologies and offerings;\nknowledge, expertise, and experience in the advertising ecosystem;\nrelationships with thir",
  "item7_clean": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur mission is to create meaningful connections between companies and their ideal customers. We provide end-to-end software and AI-powered solutions for businesses to reach, monetize and grow their global audience. We also operate a portfolio of owned mobile apps and accelerated our market penetration through an active acquisition and partnership strategy. Our scaled business model is intricately linked to the advertising ecosystem, providing a durable competitive advantage. We generate revenue when our advertisers achieve their return on spend targets with our Advertising solutions, ensuring that their success directly fuels our growth.\nSince our founding in 2011, we have been focused on building Advertising solutions for advertisers to improve the marketing and monetization of their content. Our founders, who were mobile app developers themselves, quickly realized the real impediment to success and growth in the advertising ecosystem was a discovery and monetization problem—breaking through the congested app stores to efficiently find users and successfully grow their business. Their first-hand experience with these challenges led to the development of our infrastructure and Advertising solutions. We capitalized on our success and understanding of the mobile app ecosystem by entering into the mobile game apps industry in 2018. Our global diversified portfolio of apps now consist of over 200 free-to-play mobile games across five genres, run by ten studios.\nFor 2024, our revenue grew 43% year-over-year from 2023, from $3.3 billion in 2023 to $4.7 billion in 2024. For 2023, our revenue grew 17% year-over-year from 2022, from $2.8 billion in 2022 to $3.3 billion in 2023. We generated net income of $1.6 billion in 2024, net income of $356.7 million in 2023, and net loss of $192.9 million in 2022. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.1 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Additionally, we have generated strong cash flows, with net cash provided by operating activities of $2.1 billion, $1.1 billion, and $412.8 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Given our strong financial position, we have been able to reinvest in our expansion and growth, and repurchase and withhold shares of our Class A common stock. See the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nOn February 12, 2025, we announced that we entered into a term sheet for the sale of our mobile gaming business to a privately held company (the “Acquirer”) for total consideration of $900.0 million (the “Term Sheet”). The Term Sheet provides for the total consideration to consist of $400.0 million in shares of the Acquirer’s common equity and $500.0 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The Term Sheet also provides that the Acquirer will borrow up to $250.0 million of the cash portion of the total consideration and that, if the Acquirer is unable to obtain such financing, we agree to provide financing in such amount to the Acquirer through the issuance of a promissory note. The Term Sheet is non-binding, except with respect to an agreement by the parties to use commercially reasonable best efforts in good faith to negotiate and finalize definitive agreements for the proposed transaction, a prohibition on us from engaging in discussions or negotiations with any third party other than the Acquirer regarding the sale of our mobile gaming business for a specified period, and customary terms such as fees and expenses, governing law, and termination.\nWe collect revenue from Advertising and our Apps. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, Advertising Revenue represented 68% of total revenue and Apps Revenue represented 32% of total revenue.\nWe report our operating results through two reportable segments: Advertising and Apps.\nOur CODM, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance of each segment based on several factors, of which the financial measures are segment revenue and segment adjusted EBITDA, as defined in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Advertising and Apps segments provide a view into the organization of our business and generate revenue as follows:\nWe primarily generate Advertising Revenue from fees paid by advertisers who use our Advertising solutions to grow and monetize their content. We are able to grow our Advertising Revenue by improving our various technologies.\nAdvertising clients include a wide variety of advertisers, from indie developer studios to some of the largest global internet platforms, such as Facebook and Google. We see multiple opportunities to gain new Advertising clients, and to increase spend from existing clients, as we help them grow their businesses and make them more successful.\nOur Advertising solutions include AppDiscovery, MAX, Adjust, and Wurl. Clients use AppDiscovery to automate, optimize, and manage their user acquisition investments. They set marketing and user growth goals, and AppDiscovery optimizes their ad spend in an effort to achieve their return on advertising spend targets and other marketing objectives. AppDiscovery comprises the vast majority of Advertising Revenue. Revenue is generated from our advertisers, typically on a performance-basis, and shared with our advertising publishers, typically on a cost per impression model.\nAdvertising clients use MAX to optimize purchases of app advertising inventory. The MAX tool provides insights to manage against key performance indicators, understand the long-term value of users, and help manage profitability. Revenue from MAX is generated based on a percentage of client spend. As more advertising networks move to in-app real-time bidding, we expect growth in the adoption of, and revenue from, MAX.\nAdvertising clients use Adjust's measurement and analytics marketing platform to better understand their users' journey while allowing marketers to make smarter decisions through measurement, attribution and fraud prevention. Revenue from Adjust is primarily generated from an annual software subscription fee.\nAdvertising clients use Wurl's CTV platform to distribute streaming video, maximize Advertising Revenue, and acquire and retain viewers or subscribers. Revenue from Wurl is primarily generated from content companies, typically on a usage-based model.\nApps Revenue is generated when a user of one of our Apps makes an in-app purchase (“IAP\") and when clients purchase the digital advertising inventory of our portfolio of Apps (\"IAA\"). We are able to grow our Apps Revenue by adding more apps to our Apps portfolio and increasing engagement on our existing Apps.\nOur Apps are generally free-to-play mobile games and generate IAP Revenue through IAPs. IAPs consist of virtual goods used to enhance gameplay, accelerate access to certain features or levels, and augment other mobile game progression opportunities for the user. IAPs drive more engagement and better economics from our Apps. The vast majority of our IAP Revenue flows through two app stores, Apple App Store and Google Play, which charge us a standard commission on IAPs. IAP Revenue represented 68% of total Apps Revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we had an average of 1.6 million Monthly Active Payers (\"MAPs\") across our portfolio of Apps. Over that period, we had an Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (\"ARPMAP\") of $51. See “Key Metrics” below for additional information on how we calculate MAPs and ARPMAP.\nIAA clients that purchase advertising inventory from our Apps are able to target highly relevant users from our diverse and global portfolio of over 200 mobile games. Our clients leverage a broad set of high-performing mobile ad formats, including playable and rewarded video, and are able to match these ads with relevant users resulting in a better return on their advertising\nspend. By increasing the number of users and their engagement, as well as better matching ads with the appropriate target audience, we are able to increase our revenue from IAA clients that purchase advertising inventory from our Apps. IAA Revenue represented 32% of total Apps Revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.\nWe review the following key metrics on a regular basis in order to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions.\nMonthly Active Payers (\"MAPs\").\nWe define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our Apps in a month that completed at least one IAP during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate Apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners.\nAverage Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (\"ARPMAP\").\nWe define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP.\nThe following table shows our Monthly Active Payers and Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\nMonthly Active Payers (millions)\nAverage Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer\nOur key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, other income, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonus, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, loss on disposal of long-lived assets, and non-operating foreign exchange (gain) losses. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. In addition, these measures are frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate and assess performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures and are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table provides our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2024, 2023, and 2022, and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nAdjusted as follows:\nInterest expense and loss on settlement of debt\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\nAmortization, depreciation and write-offs\nLoss on disposal of long-lived assets\nNon-operating foreign exchange (gain) loss\nStock-based compensation\nAcquisition-related expense and transaction bonus\nMoPub acquisition transition services\nNet income (loss) margin\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\nExcludes recurring operational foreign exchange gains and losses.\nIn association with the MoPub acquisition, we incurred certain costs to incentivize publishers to migrate to our MAX mediation solution, including existing publishers of MoPub as well as publishers on other competitor offerings. We have not historically incurred significant publisher migration costs, nor do we currently intend to incur significant publisher migration costs in the future. As such, we have removed the impact of these costs from Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nReflects one-time transition services provided by Twitter to AppLovin.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payment of finance leases. We use Free Cash Flow to help manage the health of our business, prepare budgets and for capital allocation purposes. We believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect our future contractual commitments. Our definition may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish Free Cash Flow or similar metrics. Thus, our Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table provides our Free Cash Flow for 2024, 2023, and 2022, and a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:\nYear Ended December 31,\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nPurchase of property and equipment\nPrincipal payments of finance leases\nNet cash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that the future success of our business depends on many factors, including the factors described below. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to continue to grow profitably while maintaining strong cash flow.\nContinue to invest in innovation\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, significant investments in our",
