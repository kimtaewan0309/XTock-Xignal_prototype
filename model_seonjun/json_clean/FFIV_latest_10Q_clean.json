Our cloud, software, and hardware solutions enable our customers to deliver fast, available, and secure digital experiences to their customers at scale. Our enterprise-grade application services are available as hardware, software, and software-as-a-service, and software-only solutions optimized for hybrid, multicloud environments, with modules that can run independently, or as part of an integrated solution on our high-performance appliances. We market and sell our products primarily through multiple indirect sales channels in the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and the Asia Pacific region (APAC). Enterprise customers (Fortune 1000 or Business Week Global 1000 companies) in the technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education, manufacturing and health care industries, along with government customers, continue to make up the largest percentage of our customer base.\nOur management team monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance on a consolidated basis. Those indicators include:\nOur revenue is derived from the sales of both products and services. The majority of our product revenues are derived from sales of our application delivery and security solutions including our BIG-IP software and systems, F5 NGINX software, and our F5 Distributed Cloud Services offerings. Our BIG-IP software solutions are sold both on a perpetual license and a subscription basis. We sell F5 NGINX on a subscription basis. F5 Distributed Cloud Services provides security, multicloud networking, and edge-based computing solutions and are offered on a subscription basis, under a unified software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") and managed service platform. Our services revenue includes annual maintenance contracts, training and consulting services.\nWe monitor the sales mix of our revenues within each reporting period. We believe customer acceptance rates of our new products, feature enhancements and consumption models are indicators of future trends. We also consider overall revenue concentration by geographic region as an additional indicator of current and future trends. Over the course of fiscal 2024, uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment began to stabilize and we saw improvements in customer demand during the second half of fiscal 2024, which has continued in fiscal 2025.\nCost of revenues and gross margins.\nWe strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain our gross margins. Significant items impacting cost of revenues are hardware costs paid to our contract manufacturers, third-party software license fees, software-as-a-service infrastructure costs, amortization of developed technology and personnel and overhead expenses. In addition, factors such as sales price, product and services mix, inventory obsolescence, returns, component price increases, warranty costs, and global supply chain constraints could significantly impact our gross margins.\nOperating expenses are substantially driven by personnel and related overhead expenses. Existing headcount and future hiring plans are the predominant factors in analyzing and forecasting future operating expense trends. Other significant operating expenses that we monitor include marketing and promotions, travel, professional fees, technology costs related to the development of new products and provision of services, facilities and depreciation expenses.\nLiquidity and cash flows.\nOur financial condition remains strong with significant cash and investments. The increase in cash and investments for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025 was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $741.6 million, partially offset by $377.1 million of cash used for the repurchase of outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program, including excise taxes. Going forward, we believe the primary driver of cash flows will be net income from operations. We will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of, or investments in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe are strategic, which may require the use of cash. Additionally, on January 31, 2020, we entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\") that provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). On January 31, 2025, the Revolving Credit Facility expired. At the time of expiration, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe view cash, short-term and long-term investments, deferred revenue, accounts receivable balances and days sales outstanding as important indicators of our financial health. Deferred revenues increased to $1.96 billion as of June 30, 2025 from $1.80 billion as of September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in maintenance renewal contracts related to our existing product installation base, in addition to increased deferred revenue associated with subscription offerings. Our days sales outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 was 42. Days sales outstanding is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable by revenue per day for a given quarter.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments and estimates that may have a significant impact on our financial results. We believe that, of our significant accounting policies, revenue recognition requires estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective judgments by management, which can materially impact reported results. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nImpact of Macroeconomic Conditions\nResults of Operations\n\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nResearch and development\nGeneral and administrative\nRestructuring charges\nOperating expenses (as a percentage of net revenue)\nResearch and development\nGeneral and administrative\nRestructuring charges\nSales and Marketing.\nSales and marketing expenses consist of the salaries, commissions and related benefits of our sales and marketing staff, the costs of our marketing programs, including public relations, advertising and trade shows, travel, facilities and depreciation expenses.
