However, some components and sub-assemblies are currently available from only a limited number of suppliers for which we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible. We also believe these conditions affect our competitors.\nRemaining Performance Obligations and Backlog\nRemaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of firm orders for which work has not been performed, excluding unexercised contract options. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, total remaining performance obligations were $4,754.9 and $4,612.6, respectively.\nBacklog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months. Backlog was $3,105.4 at December 31, 2024 and $3,156.6 at December 31, 2023.\nDistribution and Sales\nDistribution and sales occur primarily through direct sales offices, manufacturers’ representatives, resellers, and distributors.\nGovernmental Regulations\nWe face extensive government regulation around the world relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale, and distribution of our software, services, and products. The following sections describe certain significant regulations to which we are subject, but these are not the only regulations with which our businesses must comply. For a description of risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nPrivacy and Data Security\nWe are subject to privacy and data security laws around the world that may impose operational burdens on our businesses. In 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became effective in the European Union (“EU”) and United Kingdom (“UK”) and imposed restrictions on how companies use, process, and protect personal information. Additionally, repeated legal challenges to the way regulators implemented GDPR provisions relating to international data transfers have created additional operational burdens and legal risks for companies when transferring personal data back and forth from the EU to many other countries, most notably the U.S. and India. In the U.S., at least 20 states have individually passed comprehensive privacy legislation, which imposes restrictions similar (but not identical) to GDPR on companies conducting business or serving customers in those states. For example, in 2020 the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) became effective and required companies to make disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use, and sharing practices; allowed consumers to exercise control over the use and sharing of their personal data; and provided a limited private right of action for data breaches. Changes to the CCPA which became effective in 2023 have added to the processing restrictions and notifications requirements – particularly when companies engage in online advertising. Canada (Quebec) has also significantly updated its privacy laws. The compliance and other burdens on our businesses imposed by these privacy laws and regulations may be substantial as we work to comply with differing legal and implementation requirements across multiple jurisdictions.\nHealthcare Regulations\nThe manufacture, sale, lease, and service of medical diagnostic and surgical devices intended for commercial use are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the U.S. and by a variety of regulatory agencies in other countries for some of our businesses. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, known as the FD&C Act, manufacturers of medical products and devices must comply with certain regulations governing the design, testing, manufacturing, packaging, servicing, and marketing of medical products. FDA product approvals may be withdrawn or suspended if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, and foreign laws which broadly relate to our interactions with healthcare practitioners and other participants in the healthcare system, including, among others, anti-kickback law, and laws regulating the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released and/or collected, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and the GDPR.\nAnti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Laws and Regulations\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and anti-corruption laws, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. Any violation of these laws by us or our agents or distributors could create substantial liability for us, subject our officers and directors to personal liability, and cause a loss of reputation in the market. Increased business in higher risk countries could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability. In addition, becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with laws, rules, and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigating and protecting against corruption risks could be quite costly.\nExport Controls and Trade Policies\nWe are subject to numerous domestic and foreign regulations relating to our operations worldwide. In particular, our sales activities must comply with restrictions relating to the export of controlled technology and sales to denied or sanctioned parties contained in the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (OFAC). Our businesses may also be impacted by additional domestic or foreign trade regulations, including trade restrictions, trade agreements, tariffs (including new, expanded, or retaliatory tariffs), and sanctions.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nOur operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management, and workplace safety. We use, generate, and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and related claims. We are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. In connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of, or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities.\nDuring 2024, no customer accounted for 10% or more of any segment or total Company net revenues.\nGenerally, our products and solutions face significant competition, although in certain niche markets there are a limited number of competitors. We believe that we are a leader in most of our markets, and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product li",
  "item7_clean": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAll currency amounts are in millions unless specified\nRoper Technologies, Inc. (“Roper,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a diversified technology company. Roper has a proven, long-term, successful track record of compounding cash flow and increasing shareholder value. We operate market leading businesses that design and develop vertical software and technology enabled products for a variety of defensible niche markets.\nWe pursue consistent and sustainable growth in revenue, earnings, and cash flow by enabling continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring businesses that offer high value-added software, services, technology-enabled products, and solutions that we believe are capable of realizing growth while maintaining high margins.\nIn November 2022, Roper completed the divestiture of a majority equity stake in its industrial businesses, including its entire historical Process Technologies reportable segment and the industrial businesses within its historical Measurement & Analytical Solutions reportable segment (collectively “Indicor”), to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC. Following the sale of the majority equity stake, Roper retained a minority equity interest in Indicor. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding Roper’s minority equity interest in Indicor.\nDuring 2021, Roper entered into definitive agreements to divest its TransCore, Zetec, and CIVCO Radiotherapy businesses (“2021 Divestitures”). Roper completed the 2021 Divestitures by March 2022.\nThe financial results of Indicor and the 2021 Divestitures are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, discussion within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations relates to continuing operations. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further information regarding discontinued operations.\nRoper’s segment reporting structure is based on business model and delivery of performance obligations. The three reportable segments are as follows:\n–Application Software\n—Aderant, Clinisys, Data Innovations, Deltek, Frontline, IntelliTrans, PowerPlan, Procare, Strata, Transact/CBORD, Vertafore\n—ConstructConnect, DAT, Foundry, iPipeline, iTradeNetwork, Loadlink, MHA, SHP, SoftWriters\n–Technology Enabled Products\n—CIVCO Medical Solutions, FMI, Inovonics, IPA, Neptune, Northern Digital, rf IDEAS, Verathon\nFinancial information about our reportable segments is presented in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 included in this Annual Report.\nGAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. Other than the changes during 2023 as further described in Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to the methodology used to value our equity investment in Indicor, we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and other supplemental disclosures.\nThe development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch-up adjustment.\nOur most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of income taxes, valuation of other intangible assets, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles impairment analyses, and valuation of our equity investment in Indicor. Estimates are considered to be significant if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to have a material financial impact from period-to-period.\nIncome taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how, and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. If there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the tax law changes are unfavorable, there could be a resulting increase to income tax expense and the effective tax rate.\nOur 2024 effective income tax rate was 21.2% and our 2023 effective income tax rate was 21.5%.\nWe expect the effective tax rate for 2025 to be approximately\nWe account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value).\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. Under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events, and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying value. We also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit.\nWe also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative assessment utilizes the equal weighting of both an income approach (discounted cash flow) and a market approach (consisting of a comparable public company earnings multiples methodology) to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, a non-cash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess.\nKey assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the projected revenue growth rates, future operating margins, discount rates, terminal values, and earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.\nRecently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise. Negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures, and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units.\nAs of the annual impairment test, Roper has 23 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from $17.5 to $3,363.7. In 2024, the Company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units. The Company conducted its analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair values of these reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. The Company determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in any of its reporting units and thus was not required to perform a quantitative assessment for these reporting units as of October 1, 2024.\nTrade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. We first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name is less than its carrying amount. If necessary, we conduct a quantitative assessment using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the royalty rates, projected revenue growth rates, discount rates, and terminal values. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches, or other variables. Trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise.\nThe assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. Although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment applied in determining the expected results attributable to the businesses and/or reporting units. Changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.\nThe most significant identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives recognized from our acquisitions are customer relationships. The fair value for customer relationships is determined as of the acquisition date using the excess earnings method. Under this methodology the fair value is determined based on the estimated future after-tax cash flows arising from the acquired customer relationships over their estimated useful lives after considering customer attrition and contributory asset charges. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the customer attrition rates, projected customer revenue growth rates, margins, contributory asset charges, and discount rates. When testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. In evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical customer attrition patterns.\nWe evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Roper held a 45.5% and 47.3% minority equity interest in Indicor Equity, LLC, respectively. This equity interest provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. We elected to apply the fair value option as we believe this is the most reasonable method to value this equity investment. This investment is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as valuation of the investment reflects management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the equity interest. Any changes to the valuation estimates or assumptions, as described further in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, could produce significantly different results. The fair value of our equity investment in Indicor is estimated on a quarterly basis and the change in fair value is reported as a component of “Equity investments gain, net” in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nResults of Continuing Operations\nAll currency amounts are in millions unless specified, percentages are of net revenues\nPercentages may not sum due to rounding.\nThe following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated:\n\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $7,039.2 as compared to $6,177.8 for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 13.9%.
