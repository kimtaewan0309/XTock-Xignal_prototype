Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(U.S. dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in\nHowmet is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Howmet’s innovative, multi-material products, which include nickel, titanium, aluminum, and cobalt, are used worldwide in the aerospace (commercial and defense), commercial transportation, and industrial and other markets.\nIn the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company derived approximately 69% of its revenue from products sold to the commercial and defense aerospace markets. Aircraft production in the aerospace industry continues to grow based on increases in demand for new aircraft and engine spares. Aircraft backlogs remain at record levels. We expect our aerospace demand to continue to grow, including engine spares. The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) has been gradually increasing its production rates over the past several months, and Airbus SE (“Airbus”) has also signaled that its production rates are increasing, particularly in narrow body aircraft. In October 2025, Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration jointly agreed to production rate increases for the Boeing 737 MAX from 38 aircraft per month to 42 aircraft per month. Boeing and Airbus are the primary original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of aircraft airframes, and these companies’ production levels have had and are expected to have a material impact on the financial performance of Howmet. The timing and level of future aircraft builds by OEMs are subject to changes and uncertainties, which may cause our future results to differ from prior periods due to changes in product mix in certain segments.\nRecent, ongoing changes in U.S. and international government policies, including executive orders on tariffs and retaliatory trade measures, are expected to impact the pricing of our products, disrupt supply chains, and increase our costs. The timing, extent, application, and level of tariffs by various governments and our ability to recover tariffs are subject to changes and uncertainties in all segments. While the tariff situation remains fluid, we expect to pass along the costs associated with tariffs to our customers in the form of a cost pass through mechanism. There may be a delay between an increase in our costs and our ability to recover the higher costs that could impact our margins.\nResults of Operations\nSales were $2,089 in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $1,835 in the third quarter of 2024, and $6,084 in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $5,539 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase of $254, or 14%, in the third quarter of 2025 and the increase of $545, or 10%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to growth in the commercial aerospace, defense aerospace, and industrial and other markets, including engine spares, favorable product pricing, and cost pass through, partially offset by lower volumes in the commercial transportation market. Product price increases are in excess of material and inflationary cost pass through to our customers.\nCost of goods sold (“COGS”).\nCOGS as a percentage of Sales was 65.3% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 68.3% in the third quarter of 2024 and 66.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 69.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily due to higher volumes and favorable product pricing, partially offset by increased net headcount, primarily in the Engine Products segment, in support of expected revenue increases. The decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to higher volumes, favorable product pricing, and productivity gains, partially offset by increased net headcount, primarily in the Engine Products segment, in support of expected revenue increases. The Company had no COGS net insurance reimbursements in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to $6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the insurance claim related to substantial equipment damage at the Forged Wheels’ cast house in Barberton, Ohio from a mechanical failure (the “Barberton Cast House Incident”) that was settled in the second quarter of 2024.\nSelling, general administrative, and other expenses (“SG&A”).\nSG&A expenses were $100 in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $85 in the third quarter of 2024 and $274 in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $270 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase of $15, or 18%, in the third quarter of 2025 and $4, or 1%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily driven by higher employment costs and timing of other administrative expenses.\nRestructuring and other charges (credits)\n. Restructuring and other credits were less than $1 in the third quarter of 2025 compared to Restructuring and other credits of $1 in the third quarter of 2024. Restructuring and other credits were $4 in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to Restructuring and other charges of $21 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Restructuring and other credits for the third quarter of 2025 were primarily due to a gain related to post-closing adjustments from the May 2024 sale of a small U.K. manufacturing facility in Engineered Structures of $1 partially offset by exit related costs, including accelerated depreciation, of $1. Restructuring and other credits for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 were primarily due to a gain on the sale of assets at a small U.K. manufacturing facility in Engineered Structures of $3, a gain on the sale of assets at a previously closed facility in Forged Wheels of $2, a reversal of $2 for a layoff reserve related to a prior period, and a gain related to post-closing adjustments from the May 2024 sale of a small U.K. manufacturing facility in Engineered Structures of $1, partially offset by a charge for layoff costs of $3, and exit related costs, including accelerated depreciation, of $1. Restructuring and other credits for the third quarter of 2024 were primarily due to a $1 gain related to post-closing adjustments from the May 2024 sale of a small U.K. manufacturing facility in Engineered Structures. Restructuring and other charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to a net loss on the sale of a small U.K. manufacturing facility in Engineered Structures of $13 and layoff costs of $8.\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nInterest expense, net\n. Interest expense, net was $37 in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $44 in the third quarter of 2024 and $114 in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $142 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease of $7, or 16%, in the third quarter of 2025 and $28, or 20%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to the early redemptions of the\nNotes due May 2025 and the 5.125% Notes due October 2024 during various periods in 2024, and the early prepayment of its USD Term Loan Facility during various periods in 2025, partially offset by the August 2024 issuance of $500 aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes, net of the cross-currency swap that synthetically converted the 2031 Notes into a lower fixed-interest-rate Euro liability. On an annual basis, the debt reduction activities in 2025 will decrease Interest expense, net by approximately $8.\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nLoss on debt redemption.\nDebt redemption or tender premiums include the cost to redeem or repurchase certain of the Company’s notes at a price which may be equal to the greater of the principal amount or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, discounted using a defined treasury rate plus a spread, or a price based on the market price of its notes. Loss on debt redemption was less than $1 in the third quarter of 2025 and in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $6 in the third quarter of 2024 and in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the debt redemption premiums paid in the third quarter of 2024 on the early redemption of the 2025 Notes.\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nOther expense, net was $10 in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $17 in the third quarter of 2024 and $33 in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $49 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in expense of $7 in the third quarter of 2025 was primarily due to an increase of foreign currency translation gains, net of $3, and a decrease in deferred compensation of $2. The decrease in expense of $16 in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to an increase of foreign currency translation gains, net of $13. Non-service related net periodic benefit costs related to defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans is expected to be relatively flat for the full year 2025 versus 2024.\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nProvision for income taxes.\nThe estimated annual effective tax rate, before discrete items, applied to ordinary income was 21.4% in both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 20.9% in both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The tax rate including discrete items was 22.2% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to 6.2% in the third quarter of 2024. A discrete net tax benefit of $1 was recorded in the third quarter of 2025 compared to a discrete net "
