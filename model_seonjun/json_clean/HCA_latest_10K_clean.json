These discount programs generally limit our ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.” For services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, patients are generally responsible for any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amounts of such exclusions, deductibles and coinsurance continue to increase. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from government health care programs or other third-party payers. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or for financial relief under our charity care policy. We may provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care under our charity care policy. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.\n\nGenerally, other hospitals and facilities in the communities we serve provide services similar to those we offer. Additionally, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers, diagnostic and imaging centers and other medical facilities in the geographic areas in which we operate continues to increase. As a result, most of our hospitals and other facilities operate in a highly competitive environment. In some cases, competing facilities are more established than we are. Some competing facilities are physician-owned or are owned by tax-supported government agencies, and many others are owned by not-for-profit entities that may be supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and are exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to our facilities and may provide the tax-supported or not-for-profit entities an advantage in funding capital expenditures. In certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at most of our hospitals. We also face competition from specialty hospitals and from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs for market share in certain high margin services. Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their immediate locale and, therefore, our behavioral hospitals and units compete with both local and regional hospitals, including the behavioral units of general, acute care hospitals.\n\nFor example, we deploy third-party software programs, and in some instances develop our own software programs, utilizing machine learning/AI, including for use within our network to improve care. The legal framework for AI (particularly in patient care) is rapidly developing and uncertain. In 2023, HHS finalized transparency requirements for AI and other predictive algorithms used in certified health information technology, such as decision support interventions. In some cases, software can be considered a medical device under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the FDCA. In September 2022, the FDA issued non-binding final guidance that describes the types of clinical decision support software that the FDA will regulate as a medical device, potentially including software programs that were not previously treated as medical devices. Application of the new guidance may result in our current and/or future software programs used by us to provide clinical decision support being subject to FDA regulation. Some states have adopted or are considering additional measures regarding the use of AI within the health care industry. For example, California enacted Assembly Bill 3030, known as the Artificial Intelligence in Health Care Services Bill (“AB 3030”), which requires that any health care facility using generative AI to create patient communications pertaining to patient clinical information ensure that the communications include (i) a disclaimer that the communication was generated by generative AI and (ii) clear instructions describing how a patient may contact a human health care provider or other appropriate person at the health care facility. Further, Utah enacted the Artificial Intelligence Policy Act (“AIPA”), which requires physicians, nurses and other regulated health care providers to disclose to individuals if they are interacting with generative AI while receiving regulated services. Additionally, Colorado has passed the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act (“CAIA”), which will impose significant disclosure, documentation, and risk management requirements on developers of and companies that deploy “high-risk” AI systems, including systems used to recommend certain health care decisions. If we or our third-party providers are restricted from using AI as a result of any laws or regulations, it could impact our operations and cause us to incur costs to replace or modify our use of AI. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party providers to comply with AI laws and regulations could result in legal proceedings or investigations, which could result in significant legal costs and potential liability, as well as reputational harm. Further, we expect additional AI-related laws and regulations to come into effect, which could affect our business and financial condition.\nWe also perform clinical laboratory testing, and some of the tests performed are considered “laboratory developed tests” (“LDTs”). On May 6, 2024, the FDA published a final rule to increase regulatory oversight of LDTs as medical devices, classifying the tests as in vitro diagnostic products. The rule is currently the subject of legal challenges. The requirements imposed by the FDA under this rule will, over a four-year phase-in period that starts May 6, 2025, require our clinical laboratories to make significant adjustments and implement processes to comply with certain FDA medical device laws and regulations and may require FDA review or approval for LDTs used in patient care that are either newly marketed or modified after May 6, 2024.\n\nFor federal fiscal year 2024, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) increased the MS-DRG payment rates by approximately 3.1%. This increase reflected a market basket update of 3.3%, reduced by a 0.2 percentage point productivity adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2025, CMS increased the MS-DRG payment rates by approximately 2.9%. This increase reflects a market basket update of 3.4%, reduced by a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. Additional adjustments may apply, depending on patient-specific or hospital-specific factors. For example, the two-midnight rule limits payments to hospitals when services to Medicare beneficiaries are payable as inpatient services. In addition, under transfer policies, Medicare reimbursement rates may be reduced when an inpatient hospital discharges a patient to another hospital or, for specified MS-DRGs, to certain post-acute care settings. We anticipate that additional adjustments may apply in future payment years as a result of 2024 court decisions that vacated a low wage index policy CMS adopted in 2020. The policy had funded an increase to the wage index value for hospitals with low wage indexes by decreasing reimbursement for all other hospitals. CMS addressed the impact of the decision prospectively in its final rule updating inpatient hospital payment rates and policies for federal fiscal year 2025, but it is not yet clear how the agency will address the impact the low wage policy had in 2020 through 2024.\nCMS has implemented and is implementing a number of programs and requirements intended to transform Medicare from a passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and services. For example, hospitals that do not successfully participate in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program are subject to a 25% reduction of the market basket update. Hospitals that do not demonstrate meaningful use of electronic health records (“EHRs”) are subject to a 75% reduction of the market basket update.\n\nCMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require. Depending on the services provided, a hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit. A payment rate is established for each APC and updated for each calendar year. Each calendar year, the annual market basket update is further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2024, CMS increased payment rates under the outpatient PPS by an estimated 3.1%. This increase reflected a market basket increase of 3.3%, reduced by a 0.2 percentage point productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2025, CMS increased payment rates by an estimated 2.9%. This increase reflects a market basket increase of 3.4%, reduced by a 0.5 percentage point productivity adjustment. CMS requires hospitals to submit quality data relating to outpatient care to avoid receiving a 2.0 percentage point reduction in the annual payment update under the outpatient PPS.\n\nInpatient hospital services furnished in behavioral hospitals and behavioral units of general, acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals are reimbursed on a PPS basis. The inpatient psychiatric facility (“IPF”) PPS is based upon a per diem payment, with adjustments to account for certain patient and facility characteristics. The IPF PPS contains an “outlier” policy for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a facility’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment rate in a",
  "item7_clean": "Reserves for professional liability risks were $2.131 billion and $2.089 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The current portion of these reserves, $587 million and $532 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is included in “other accrued expenses.” Obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. Reserves for professional liability risks (net of $80 million and $42 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively) were $2.051 billion and $2.047 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are comprised of $1.059 billion and $947 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $992 million and $1.100 billion, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims. The 2024 increase in case reserves for known claims and the corresponding decrease in reserves for incurred but not reported claims is the result of changes in case management processes at our insurance subsidiary that include establishing case reserve estimates earlier and resolving claims quicker.\n\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $10.514 billion in 2024 compared to $9.431 billion in 2023 and $8.522 billion in 2022. The $1.083 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2024, compared to 2023, was related primarily to an increase in net income of $542 million, excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities, and a positive change in working capital items of $351 million, mainly from a decline in inventories and other assets. The decrease in inventories during 2024 was the result of a targeted effort by our supply chain management to manage and reduce the inventory levels carried in our facilities. The $909 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2023, compared to 2022, was related primarily to a positive change in working capital items of $695 million, mainly from an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and an increase in net income of $275 million, excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt. Cash payments for interest and income taxes increased $504 million for 2024 compared to 2023. Working capital totaled $1.237 billion at December 31, 2024 and $2.272 billion at December 31, 2023. The decline in working capital is primarily due to the $2.274 billion increase in long-term debt due within one year, offset by an increase of $998 million in cash and cash equivalents and an increase of $793 million in accounts receivable.\nCash used in investing activities was $4.933 billion, $5.317 billion and $3.389 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $4.875 billion in 2024, $4.744 billion in 2023 and $4.395 billion in 2022. Planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate between $5.0 billion and $5.2 billion in 2025. At December 31, 2024, there were projects under construction which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately $4.7 billion. We expect to fund capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds. We expended $266 million, $635 million and $224 million for acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash flows from sales of hospitals and health care entities increased to $328 million of net proceeds for 2024 from $193 million of net proceeds for 2023, and was $1.237 billion in 2022 primarily related to proceeds from our sales of other health care entities.\n\nOther operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 21.0% in 2024 and 19.8% in 2023. Other operating expenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. The 1.2% increase in other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues for 2024 compared to 2023, was primarily related to increased costs for state provider fees in certain states, professional fees and repairs and maintenance, primarily related to remediation activities in certain hospitals in the state of Florida in response to Hurricane Milton. We have seen inflation have a negative impact on certain of these expenses and expect inflationary pressures will continue to impact operating expenses in 2025. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $627 million and $619 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded an increase of $40 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, during 2023 to our provision for professional liability risks related to the receipt of updated actuarial information.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (Continued)\nRevenues (continued)\nManagement expects a continuation of the challenges related to collection of patient due accounts. Adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations. See Item 1, “Business — Developments in Health Care Public Policy.”\n\nReserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. Individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. Case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. Once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. Several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. These methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. Company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. This company-specific data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.\n\nRevenues increased 8.7% to $70.603 billion for 2024 from $64.968 billion for 2023. The increase in revenues was due primarily to the combined impact of a 5.3% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission compared to 2023. Same facility revenues increased 7.9% due primarily to the combined impact of a 4.5% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission compared to 2023. Our revenues from Medicaid state directed and supplemental payment programs totaled approximately $4.9 billion and $3.9 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nSalaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 44.1% in 2024 and 45.4% in 2023. Salaries and benefits per equivalent admission increased 0.4% in 2024 compared to 2023. Same facility salaries and benefits per full time equivalent increased 1.8% for 2024 compared to 2023. We continue to utilize certain contract, overtime and other premium rate labor costs to support our clinical staff and patients. While these costs have declined compared to the prior year period, future costs may be affected by labor market conditions and other factors. Share-based compensation expense was $360 million in 2024 and $262 million in 2023.\nSupplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 15.2% in both 2024 and 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 3.1% in 2024 compared to 2023. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 5.6% for medical devices and 3.2% for general medical and surgical items, but declined 2.4% for pharmacy supplies in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nContinue to Utilize Economies of Scale to Grow the Company.\nWe believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow our company by fully utilizing the scale and scope of our organization. We continue to invest in initiatives such as care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. We believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. We continue to invest in our shared service platforms to deploy key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.\n\nResults of Operations (continued)\nYears Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (continued)\nInterest expense increased to $2.061 billion for 2024 from $1.938 billion for 2023. The $123 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the average debt balance. The average effective interest rate for our long-term debt was 5.0% for both 2024 and 2023. Our average debt balance was $41.388 billion for 2024 compared to $38.790 billion for 2023.\nGains on sales of facilities were $14 million for 2024 and losses on sales of facilities were $5 million for 2023.\nThe effective income tax rate was 24.5% for 2024 and 23.6% for 2023. The effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships.\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nNet income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $5.760 billion, or $22.00 per diluted share, for 2024, compared to $5.242 billion, or $18.97 per diluted share, for 2023. The 2024 results include gains on sales of facilities of $14 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. The 2024 results also include additional expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $250 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, related to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which impacted our facilities in North Carolina and certain facilities in Florida. The 2023 results include losses on sales of facilities of $5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Our provisions for income taxes for 2024 and 2023 include tax benefits of $102 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, and $93 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 261.806 million shares and 276.412 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 17.798 million and 14.465 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.\n\nRevenues increased to $70.603 billion for 2024 from $64.968 billion for 2023. Revenues increased 8.7% and 7.9%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2024, compared to 2023. The consolidated revenues increase can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 5.3% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. The same facility revenues increase resulted primarily from the combined impact of a 4.5% increase in equivalent admissions and a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. Our revenues from Medicaid state directed and supplemental payment programs totaled approximately $4.9 billion and $3.9 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring 2024, consolidated admissions increased 5.0% and same facility admissions increased 4.9%, compared to 2023. Inpatient surgical volumes increased 2.2% on both a consolidated basis and a same facility basis during 2024, compared to 2023. Outpatient surgical volumes declined 1.9% on a consolidated basis and declined 1.6% on a same facility basis during 2024, compared to 2023. Emergency room visits increased 4.8% on a consolidated basis and increased 4.9% on a same facility basis during 2024, compared to 2023.\n\nImplicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Estimated implicit price concessions are recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the age of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been performed. The estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and collections at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. We believe our quarterly updates to the estimated implicit price concession amounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable estimates of our revenues and valuations of our accounts receivable. These routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to the valuations of our accounts receivable or period-to-period comparisons of our revenues.\n\nReserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. The estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.855 billion to $2.221 billion at December 31, 2024 and $1.863 billion to $2.230 billion at December 31, 2023. Our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. We perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our as",
