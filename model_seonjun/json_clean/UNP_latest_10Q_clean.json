We analyze a wide range of economic scenarios and the impact on our ability to generate cash. These analyses inform our liquidity plans and activities outlined below and indicate we have sufficient borrowing capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volume.\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, we generated $2.5 billion of cash provided by operating activities and paid our quarterly dividend. Also within the third quarter of 2025, we announced the pending acquisition of Norfolk Southern described in Note 18 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1, and paused our share repurchase program. On September 30, 2025, we had $808 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.0 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility, and up to $600 million undrawn on the Receivables Facility. We have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt covenants.\nAs described in the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the table below, we have contractual obligations that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets, as of the date of this filing, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, our commercial obligations, financings, and commitments are customary transactions that are like those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.\nThe following table identifies material contractual obligations as of September 30, 2025:\nOct. 1, through Dec. 31, 2025\nPayments Due by Dec. 31,\nPurchase obligations [b]\nOperating leases [c]\nOther post-retirement benefits [d]\nFinance lease obligations [e]\nTotal contractual obligations\nExcludes finance lease obligations of $108 million as well as unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs of ($1,688) million. Includes an interest component of $26,248 million.\nPurchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts; purchase commitments for ties, ballast, and rail; and agreements to purchase other goods and services.\nIncludes leases for locomotives, freight cars, other equipment, and real estate. Includes an interest component of $125 million.\nIncludes estimated other post-retirement, medical, and life insurance payments and payments made under the unfunded pension plan for the next ten years.\nRepresents total obligations, including interest component of $9 million.\nOTHER MATTERS\nAsserted and unasserted claims\n– See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1.\n– See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1.\n– See Note 18 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1, and the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 28, 2025, by and among UPC, Ruby Merger Sub 1 Corporation, Ruby Merger Sub 2 LLC, and Norfolk Southern, which is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 2.1 to the Corporation’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 29, 2025.\nCAUTIONARY INFORMATION\nCertain statements in this report, and statements in other reports or information filed or to be filed with the SEC (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us), are, or will be, forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements and information include, without limitation, statements and information set forth under the captions “Liquidity and Capital Resources” regarding our capital plan, share repurchase programs, contractual obligations, and \"Other Matters\" in this Item 2 of Part I. Forward-looking statements and information also include any other statements or information in this report (including information incorporated herein by reference) regarding: the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated therein (described in Note 18 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1), potential impacts of public health crises, including pandemics, epidemics, and the outbreak of other contagious disease, such as the coronavirus and its variant strains (COVID); the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars and other geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and any impacts on our business operations, financial results, liquidity, and financial position, and on the world economy (including customers, employees, and supply chains), including as a result of fluctuations in volume and carloadings; closing of customer manufacturing, distribution or production facilities; expectations as to operational or service improvements; expectations as to hiring challenges; availability of employees; expectations regarding the effectiveness of steps taken or to be taken to improve operations, service, infrastructure improvements, and transportation plan modifications (including those discussed in response to increased traffic); expectations as to cost savings, revenue growth, and earnings; the time by which goals, targets, aspirations, or objectives will be achieved; projections, predictions, expectations, estimates, or forecasts as to our business, financial, and operational results, future economic performance, and general economic conditions; proposed new products and services; estimates of costs relating to environmental remediation and restoration; estimates and expectations regarding tax matters; estimates and expectations regarding current or potential tariffs; potential impacts of H.R.1, which was enacted on July 4, 2025; expectations that claims, litigation, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, labor negotiations or agreements, cyber-attacks, or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity and any other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements may be identified by their use of forward-looking terminology, such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “should,” “would,” “will,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “projects,” and similar words, phrases, or expressions.\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance, results, or outcomes, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times that, or by which, such performance, results, or outcomes will be achieved, if ever. Forward-looking statements and information are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements and information. Forward-looking statements and information reflect the good faith consideration by management of currently available information, and may be based on underlying assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, such information and assumptions (and, therefore, such forward-looking statements and information) are or may be subject to variables or unknown or unforeseeable events or circumstances over which management has little or no influence or control, and many of these risks and uncertainties are currently amplified by and may continue to be amplified by, or in the future may be amplified by, among other things, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statement was made. We assume no obligation to update forward looking information to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions, or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect thereto or with respect to other forward-looking statements.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nReferences to our website address in this report, including references in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 2, are provided as a convenience and do not constitute, and should not be deemed, an incorporation by reference of the information contained on, or available through, the website. Therefore, such information should not be considered part of this report.\n\nFor intermodal shipments each container or trailer equals one carload.\n– Bulk includes shipments of grain and grain products, fertilizer, food and refrigerated, and coal and renewables. Freight revenues from bulk shipments increased in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2025 compared to 2024 due to 7% volume growth for both periods and core pricing gains, partially offset by business mix (from increased coal shipments) and lower fuel surcharge revenues. The volume increases\nwere driven by higher demand for coal used in electricity generation due to higher natural gas prices and business wins and strength in grain and grain products from increased exports and soybean crush production. Lower food and refrigerated carloads partially offset the volume growth.\n– Industrial includes shipments of industrial chemicals and plastics, metals and minerals, forest products, and energy and specialized markets. Freight revenues from industrial shipments increased in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2025 compared to 2024 due to core pricing gains and volume increases, partially offset by business mix and lower fuel surcharge revenues. Quarterly increases in plastics, industrial chemicals, and steel carloads more than offset the reduced iron ore (as a result of tariff uncertainties) and government carloads. Year-to-date volu"
