  "item1_clean": "Our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. We have operations outside the United States that make up a significant portion of our total revenue, which can present challenges depending on economic and geopolitical conditions on both a global and regional scale. Adverse economic conditions, including higher interest rates, inflation, higher fuel prices, higher unemployment, or recession, could adversely affect demand for the Company's products and services. Economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has in the past resulted in periods of decreased revenue, and could in the future result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nThe markets for many of our products and services are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors have been able to replicate certain features offered by some of our products and services or respond more rapidly to emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers. In addition, some of our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers may develop in-house equipment and components that they currently purchase from us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nGarmin offers a variety of services products to the aviation market. Web and mobile app-based products offered via FltPlan.com and our Garmin Pilot™ electronic flight bag application, help pilots plan, file, fly, and log flights and offer a wealth of information across all phases of flight. Business and commercial aviation customers also benefit from our FltPlan® safety management system, and our AeroData solutions consisting of runway analysis and performance data, weight and balance, obstacle clearance, load planning, and navigation database products. Garmin continues to provide industry-leading product support, and offers a wide selection of databases, training products, extended warranties, and subscription services for all aviation segments.\n\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge. Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. Any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, supply chain constraints, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nGross margins in some of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of other factors, including product mix, foreign exchange rates, tariffs, freight and component costs, manufacturing facility utilization, and unit volumes. In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life. To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n\nGarmin also provides highly differentiated products and service solutions to other growth markets such as commercial air-carrier, military and defense, electric aircraft, and the Advanced Air Mobility / eVTOL space. By offering products such as Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and mission-optimized solutions to military and defense contractors/customers, and products tested and optimized for high duty cycle commercial aviation operations, Garmin is emerging as a strong competitor in these business arenas.\n\nClimate change can also pose a risk to our business due to related regulatory and legislative measures, requirements of our OEM customers or other strategic partners, and evolving societal pressures, including pressures to reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation and marine industries, which could negatively impact the market for our products. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulates greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act. U.S. Congress, in addition to other regulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world, could pass further legislation to mandate greenhouse gas emission reduction, implement cap-and-trade programs, or promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. Such measures could influence mobility and transportation trends, which could decrease the demand for certain of our products.\n\nRegulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world, including in the United States, have enacted or are considering enacting a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties, governmental investigations and regulatory proceedings, litigation, harm to our brand, and a decrease in the use of our products and services. Many of these laws provide for significant penalties. Under the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, for example, potential penalties can be as high as 4% of a company’s total global revenue.\n\nSome of our products also use satellite signals from Russia’s GLONASS, the European Union Galileo system, and the Chinese BDS. National or European authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets, including our competitors, which could harm our competitive position. Use of non-U.S. GNSS signals may also be subject to FCC waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations. If we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems, or obtain timely and equal access to service signals, it could result in lost revenue.\n\nOur products and services, or those of our OEM customers in which our products are installed, could be affected by design and manufacturing defects. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in our products and services, and may have limited ability to respond to those impacting our OEM customers. Failure to do so can result, and in the past has resulted in recalls, product replacements or modifications, and may cause reputational harm, and significant warranty and other expenses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe continually evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.\n\nOur principal manufacturing facilities for consumer products are located in Taiwan. The People’s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands, and all of mainland China. The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government. Although significant economic and cultural relations exist between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan. There is also a risk that the PRC government may unilaterally seek to occupy Taiwan, by force if necessary, without a clear triggering event. In this scenario, Garmin’s manufacturing facilities and suppliers based in Taiwan could be subject to disruptions that could have a material negative impact to our operations. The United States' relations with Taiwan are governed by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which signifies when the U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the PRC, referred to as the \"one-China\" policy. China's relations with Taiwan may also be influenced by changes in relations between the U.S. and China. Deviations from the \"one-China\" policy or other conflicts or disputes could lead to adverse changes in China-U.S. and China-Taiwan relations and could materially adversely affect our manufacturing operations and suppliers based in Taiwan, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.\n\nThe value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings. Third parties have claimed and may in the future claim that we or our customers (some of whom are indemnified by us) are infringing their intellectual property rights. For example, individuals and groups have purchased and may in future purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers. The number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. From time to time, we receive communications alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rig",
  "item7_clean": "Total operating income increased 46% in absolute dollars and increased 440 basis points as a percent of revenue in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. The increase in operating income as a percent of revenue was due to increased sales, increased gross margin as a percent of revenue, and lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue, as described above. The improved performance in fitness, outdoor, marine, and auto OEM was partially offset by a decrease in aviation. Auto OEM experienced an operating loss in fiscal year 2024, and we expect auto OEM to experience an operating loss in 2025.\n\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The presentation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.\n\nThe fitness, outdoor, and marine gross margin increases of 480 basis points, 340 basis points, and 180 basis points, respectively, were primarily attributable to lower costs of goods and favorable product mix. Gross margin remained relatively flat within the aviation segment. The auto OEM gross margin decrease of 550 basis points was primarily attributable to unfavorable product mix.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased 10% in absolute dollars and decreased 170 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the year-ago period. The absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel-related expenses and information technology costs.\n\nThe table below sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five reportable segments. The Company’s CODM primarily uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss to assess segment performance and allocate resources. Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses. Net sales are directly attributed to each segment. Most costs of goods sold and the majority of operating expenses are also directly attributed to each segment, while certain other costs of goods sold and operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a reasonable manner considering the specific facts and circumstances of the expenses being allocated. For each line item in the table below, the total of the reportable segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nResearch and development expense increased 10% in absolute dollars and decreased 150 basis points as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago period. The absolute dollar increase was primarily due to higher engineering personnel costs.\n\nNet cash outlays for income taxes exceeded income tax expense in each of the 2024, 2023, and 2022 fiscal years, partially due to the provisions of the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which require us to capitalize certain research and development costs and amortize those costs on our U.S. tax returns over a period of five or fifteen years, depending on where the associated costs were incurred. Primarily as a result of these provisions, we expect net cash outlays for income taxes to again exceed income tax expense in fiscal 2025. Cash paid for taxes is also expected to increase in 2025 as compared to 2024, primarily due to the payment of taxes in arrears related to the intercompany transaction to migrate ownership of certain intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company changed the presentation of operating expense to include advertising expense within selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of income, which management believes to be a more meaningful presentation. Results for the 52-week and 53-week periods ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, have been recast to conform to current period presentation. This change had no effect on the Company’s consolidated operating or net income.\n\nCash used in financing activities totaled $626.9 million for fiscal 2024, compared to $636.5 million for fiscal 2023. This decrease was primarily due to lower purchases of treasury shares under the share repurchase plan in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. This was partially offset by an increase in dividends paid and an increase in purchases of treasury stock related to equity awards in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.\n\nCash used in investing activities totaled $393.3 million for fiscal 2024, compared to $333.0 million for fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of marketable securities in fiscal 2024 compared to net redemptions of marketable securities in fiscal 2023. This was partially offset by a decrease in cash used for acquisitions in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.\n\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $1,432.5 million for fiscal 2024, compared to $1,376.3 million for fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers primarily driven by higher net sales, partially offset by increases in cash paid for cost of goods sold and operating expenses in fiscal 2024 when compared to fiscal 2023.\n\nGross profit dollars in fiscal year 2024 increased 23%, primarily due to the increase in net sales compared to the year-ago period as described above. Consolidated gross margin increased 120 basis points when compared to the year-ago period due to higher margins within certain segments, partially offset by unfavorable segment mix.\n\nGlobal taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by multinational corporations, including the establishment of a global minimum tax rate of 15%. Many countries in which Garmin operates have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, global minimum tax legislation. Additionally, the Swiss canton of Schaffhausen passed legislation in 2023 that increased the cantonal corporate tax rate in 2024, resulting in a combined federal and cantonal statutory tax rate of approximately 15% in Switzerland. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2024 as compared to 2023 and 2022 is primarily due to the increase in the combined Switzerland statutory tax rate, while our effective tax rate in 2023 also benefited from the discrete impacts noted above.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, we had approximately $3.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Management invests idle or surplus cash in accordance with the investment policy, which has been approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The investment policy’s primary objectives are to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. Garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2024 and 2023 were 3.3% and 2.7%, respectively. The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral, and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. See Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding marketable securities.\n\nTotal operating expense increased 10% in absolute dollars and decreased 320 basis points as a percent of revenue in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023.\n\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nNet sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and many marine products experience increased demand in the first and second quarters in advance of the summer boating season. Sales of our consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products. Our aviation and auto OEM products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications, regulatory mandates, auto program manufacturing, and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.\n\nPartially to respond to changes to global tax standards, we initiated an intercompany transaction in 2020 which migrates ownership of certain intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States, which is the Company's primary location for research, development and executive management. At the end of this migration, a higher percentage of income will be recognized in the U.S. Due to the subjectivity inherent in transfer pricing associated with this intercompany transaction, we have obtained advanced pricing agreements with the relevant jurisdictions.\n\nThe increase in fitness revenue was driven by sales growth across all product categories, led by strong demand for wearables. Outdoor revenue increased primarily due to sales growth in adventure watches. Aviation revenue increased primarily due to growth in OEM product categories. The increase in marine revenue was primarily driven by contributions from the Company's acquisition of JL Audio. Auto OEM revenue increased primarily due to increased shipments of domain controllers.\n\nRaw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold. Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage lower-cost or more readily available components.\n\nOur net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners, dealer and distributor network, installation and repair shops, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), our online webshop (garmin.com), subscriptions for connected services, and our own retail stores. Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive from our retail, dealer, and distributor customers. Certain arrangements with OEM customers are entered into at the beginning of an aircraft, boat, or vehicle life cycle with the intent to fulfill customer purchasing requirements for the entire production life, although there are generally no firm volume commitments, and sales are therefore generated on an order-by-order basis. As a result, we do not believe backlog information is material to the understanding of our business.\n\nSales price variability, including that which is associated with foreign currency fluctuations, has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit. Our consolidated gross margin, representing gross profit as a percentage of net sales, is also dependent on segment mix and product mix within each segment.\n\nNet sales increased 20% in fiscal year 2024 when compared to the year-ago period. Total unit sales increased approximately 15% to 18.6 million units in 2024 from 16.2 million units in 2023. Outdoor revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix at 31% in 2024, compared to 32% in 2023.\n\nWe believe that our flexible production model allows our factories to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing. In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products. Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan than in other locations.\n\nThe average interest rate returns on cash and investments during the 52-weeks ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were 3.3% and 2.7%, respectively. Interest income increased primarily due to higher balances of cash and investments and higher yields on fixed-income securities.\n\nShipping and handling costs associated with the transportation and delivery of our products are included in cost of goods sold. Such costs fluctuate due to a number of factors, including market pricing and the mix of modes of transportation we utilize.\n\nThe majority of our research and development costs represent engineering personnel costs, costs of test equipment and components used in product and prototype development, and outside product development costs.\n\nadvertising costs associated primarily with media advertising, cooperative advertising with our retail partners, point of sale displays, and sponsorships;\n\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not foot due to rounding):\n\nForeign currency gains and losses for the Company are driven by movements of a number of currencies in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the Euro is the functional currency of several subsidiaries, and the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds. Other notable currency exposures include the Australian Dollar and Polish Zloty. The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.\n\nAs a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 9% to $1,411.4 million from $1,289.6 million in the prior year.\n\nThe $20.6 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro, Polish Zloty, and Australian Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar. During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 5.5% against the Euro, 4.1% against the Polish Zloty, and 8.9% against the Australian Dollar, resulting in losses of $27.1 million, $11.3 million, and $8.7 million, respectively, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening 6.5% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $36.4 million. The remaining net currency loss of $9.9 million was related to the impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial.\n\nWe recognize liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions, including those related to transfer pricing, based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be not required or it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\n\nThe $26.4 million currency gain recognized in fiscal 2023 was primarily due ",
