MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide material information relevant to an assessment of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources. The MD&A is designed to focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition. This includes descriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on reported operations, as well as matters that are reasonably likely based on management’s assessment to have a material impact on future operations. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:\nInformation Relating to Forward-Looking Statements;\nResults of Operations;\nLiquidity and Capital Resources; and\nCritical Accounting Estimates.\ne three and nine-month periods ended October 3, 2025 in\nINFORMATION RELATING TO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from the results, developments and business decisions contemplated by our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak\nonly as of the date of the report, document, press release, webcast, call, materials or other communication in which they are made. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we do not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise.\nBusiness and Strategic Risks\nConditions in the global economy, including military conflicts and changes in trade and tariff policies, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce the prices we charge.\nOur growth depends on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.\nNon-U.S. economic, political, legal, compliance, social and business factors can negatively affect our business and financial statements.\nOur growth can also suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Investment Risks\nAny inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our business. Our acquisition of businesses, investments, or other strategic relationships could also negatively impact our business and financial statements and our indemnification rights may not fully protect us from liabilities related thereto.\nDivestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business and financial statements.\nSignificant disruptions in, or breaches in security of, our information technology (“IT”) systems or data or violations of data privacy laws can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nDefects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services, or allegations thereof, can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nIf we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.\nClimate change and sustainability matters, legal or regulatory measures to address climate change and sustainability matters, and any inability on our part to address related stakeholder expectations may negatively affect us.\nOur financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of the supplies that we use in, and the labor we need for, our operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets.\nOur restructuring actions can have long-term adverse effects on our business and financial statements.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. These risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of intellectual property comparable to the United States.\nThird parties from time to time claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\nFinancial and Tax Risks\nOur existing and future indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings; and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nForeign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our financial statements.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our earnings. In addition, challenges to tax positions taken through audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.\nChanges in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.\nLegal, Regulatory, Compliance and Reputational Risks\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation, and failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nWe are subject to or otherwise responsible for a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that can adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nOur operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nCertain provisions in Veralto’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of Veralto, which could decrease the trading price of Veralto’s common stock.\nThe forum selection provisions under Veralto’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation could discourage lawsuits against Veralto and Veralto’s directors, officers, employees and stockholders.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nSeparation and Our Relationship with Danaher Risks\nAs an independent, publicly traded company, Veralto may not enjoy the same benefits that Veralto did as a part of Danaher.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to Danaher pursuant to the separation agreement could materially and adversely affect Veralto’s business and financial statements.\nIn connection with Veralto’s separation from Danaher, Danaher will indemnify Veralto for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure Veralto against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Danaher’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.\nIf there is a determination that the separation and/or the distribution, together with certain related transactions, is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Danaher and its stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and we could also incur significant liabilities.\nVeralto may be affected by significant restrictions, including on its ability to engage in certain corporate transactions for a two-year period after the distribution in order to avoid triggering significant tax-related liabilities.\nCertain of Veralto’s executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity interest in Danaher. Also, certain of Danaher’s current directors and a former Danaher officer and former Danaher employee are part of Veralto’s Board, which may create conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest.\nDanaher may compete with Veralto.\nVeralto or Danaher may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the separation or Veralto may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire.\nOVERVIEW\nVeralto Corporation’s unifying purpose is\nSafeguarding the World’s Most Vital Resources\nTM\n.
