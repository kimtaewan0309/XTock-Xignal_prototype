SDG&E submitted a request seeking review and recovery of $417 million of its wildfire mitigation plan costs incurred in 2023 that were in addition to the amounts authorized in the 2019 GRC and not addressed in the 2024 GRC. Additionally, SDG&E and SoCalGas submitted a combined request seeking review and recovery of $240 million and $499 million, respectively, of PSEP costs incurred from 2014 through 2019 and 2015 through 2020, respectively. SDG&E and SoCalGas expect to receive proposed decisions for their Track 3 requests in the first half of 2026.\nRevenue requirements associated with the Track 3 requests have been recorded in regulatory accounts. SDG&E and SoCalGas are authorized interim rate recovery of up to 50% of the recorded PSEP regulatory account balance at the end of each year. Such interim rate recovery is subject to refund, contingent on the reasonableness review decision for their Track 3 requests.\nCPUC Cost of Capital\nIn March 2025, SDG&E and SoCalGas each filed applications with the CPUC seeking to update their cost of capital for 2026 through 2028, subject to the CCM. SDG&E and SoCalGas expect to receive an FD by the end of 2025. We further discuss the cost of capital and CCM in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSDG&E\nWildfire Fund and Continuation Account\n2019 Wildfire Legislation\n. We describe the 2019 Wildfire Legislation and SDG&E’s commitment to make annual shareholder contributions to the Wildfire Fund through 2028 in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.\nSDG&E is exposed to the risk that the participating California electric IOUs may incur third-party wildfire costs for which they will seek recovery from the Wildfire Fund with respect to wildfires that have occurred since enactment of the 2019 Wildfire Legislation in July 2019. In such a situation, SDG&E may recognize a reduction of its Wildfire Fund asset and record accelerated amortization against earnings when available coverage is reduced due to recoverable claims from any of the participating IOUs. The carrying value of SDG&E’s Wildfire Fund asset totaled $264 million at September 30, 2025.\nIn October 2025, a participating IOU publicly disclosed that it has received, or expects to receive, approximately $1.2 billion in aggregate reimbursements from the Wildfire Fund for eligible claims related to wildfires that occurred in 2019 and 2021. In the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2025, SDG&E reduced its Wildfire Fund asset by recording $2 million of accelerated amortization in O&M on Sempra’s and SDG&E’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAlso in October 2025, another participating IOU publicly disclosed its intent to seek reimbursement from the Wildfire Fund for losses incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with a wildfire that remains under investigation, and for which the cause has not yet been conclusively determined. The administrator of the Wildfire Fund has confirmed that this wildfire qualifies as a “covered wildfire” for purposes of accessing the fund. The participating IOU has stated that it is currently unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses associated with this event. Accordingly, SDG&E is unable to estimate a range of potential loss resulting from any reduction in available coverage from the Wildfire Fund.\nFor existing claims or new claims based on any California electric IOUs’ assets determined to be a cause of fires, including fires of the size and scope of the Eaton fire, payments of these claims could have a material adverse effect on the Wildfire Fund, including potentially exhausting the fund, and on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s financial condition and results of operations up to the carrying value of our Wildfire Fund asset, with additional potential material exposure if SDG&E’s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire.\n2025 Wildfire Legislation.\nWe describe the 2025 Wildfire Legislation that was signed into law in September 2025 in Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2025 Wildfire Legislation established, among other things, the Continuation Account, a new state-administered account with up to $18.0 billion of additional liquidity to reimburse catastrophic wildfire-related claims incurred by large California electric IOUs, including SDG&E, if the Wildfire Fund is depleted. The funds in the account would only be available for claims arising from wildfires that ignited on or after September 19, 2025. The 2025 Wildfire Legislation preserves key elements of the 2019 Wildfire Legislation, including cost recovery standards and requirements, a cap on liability in the event of a finding of imprudence by the CPUC, and continued access to wildfire claims liquidity through the new Continuation Account. All of California’s large electric IOUs, including SDG&E, have elected to participate in the Continuation Account.\nIf the Continuation Account becomes operative, it would be funded with a combination of $9.0 billion from ratepayer contributions and $9.0 billion from electric IOU shareholder contributions. Electric IOU shareholder contributions totaling $5.1 billion would be obtained through fixed annual contributions of $300 million from 2029 through 2045, plus an additional $3.9 billion in contingent shareholder contributions payable in annual installments of $780 million. SDG&E’s proportionate share of the aggregate shareholder contribution amount through 2045 is expected to be $387 million, comprising (i) $219.3 million of fixed contributions of $12.9 million annually for 17 years, and (ii) $167.7 million of contingent contributions of $33.5 million annually for five years.\nThe 2025 Wildfire Legislation establishes a multi-stakeholder task force, coordinated by the Wildfire Fund’s administrator, to prepare and submit to the California legislature and Governor of California on or before April 1, 2026, a report that evaluates and sets forth recommendations on new models to complement or replace the Wildfire Fund. If the Wildfire Fund and the Continuation Account, if it becomes operative, are materially diminished, exhausted or terminated, SDG&E would lose the protection afforded by these funds, and as a consequence, a fire in any California electric IOUs’ service territory could have a material adverse effect on SDG&E’s and Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nSDG&E files separately with the FERC for its authorized transmission revenue requirement and ROE on FERC-regulated electric transmission operations and assets.\nSDG&E’s authorized TO5 settlement provided for an ROE of 10.60%, consisting of a base ROE of 10.10% plus the California ISO adder. In December 2024, the FERC issued an order, which SDG&E has appealed, finding that SDG&E is not eligible for the California ISO adder and that the TO5 adder refund provision had been triggered, requiring SDG&E to refund customers the California ISO adder retroactively from June 1, 2019.\nIn October 2024, SDG&E submitted its TO6 filing to the FERC and requested it to be effective January 1, 2025. SDG&E’s TO6 filing proposes, among other items, an increase to SDG&E’s currently authorized base ROE from 10.10% to 11.75% plus the California ISO adder, for a total ROE of 12.25%. In December 2024, the FERC accepted SDG&E’s TO6 filing, subject to refund; suspended the effective date to June 1, 2025; established hearing and settlement judge procedures; and disallowed the inclusion of the California ISO adder, the last of which SDG&E has appealed.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSDG&E has entered into PPAs and tolling agreements that are variable interests in unconsolidated entities. We discuss variable interests in Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCatastrophic Events Cost Recovery\nIn July 2025, the CPUC issued an FD that authorizes partial recovery of costs recorded in SoCalGas’ Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account. The FD authorizes the recovery of $19 million out of the requested $55 million, denying recovery of COVID-19 costs included in the Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account. In the nine months ended September 30, 2025, SoCalGas recorded a write-off of $36 million ($25 million after tax) in disallowed costs, comprising a $29 million reduction in Utilities: Natural Gas Revenues and a $7 million reduction in regulatory interest in Other (Expense) Income, Net, on Sempra’s and SoCalGas’ Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. SoCalGas has filed a request with the CPUC for a rehearing of the FD. SoCalGas expects to receive a post-rehearing FD in the first half of 2026.\nThe LA Fires burned in SoCalGas’ service territory. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection estimated that the Palisades and Eaton fires destroyed approximately 16,200 structures and damaged approximately 2,000 structures. SoCalGas’ infrastructure in the fire-affected areas that is underground, which constitutes most of its infrastructure in these areas, remains undamaged by the fires and we believe safe to continue serving customers as they return to their homes and businesses. To date, natural gas service has been restored to almost 16,000 customers in the Eaton and Palisades fire areas, and crews will continue that work as customers return to their properties.\nAliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility\nFrom October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced the Leak, which we discuss in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and in “Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Annual Report. As of October 31, 2025, there are three outstanding plaintiffs who have not agreed to a settlement in principle.\nOperations and Reliability.\nNatural gas withdrawn from storage is important to "
