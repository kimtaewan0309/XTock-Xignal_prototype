As a result, we consolidate this VIE in our consolidated financial statements, with the combined 60% equity interest owned by JERA and Mitsui recorded as noncontrolling interest. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Blue Point Joint Venture,” below, and Note 12—Variable Interest Entity, for additional information on the Blue Point joint venture.\nLow-carbon ammonia demand\nIn addition to discussions with existing and potential customers who have interest in using low-carbon ammonia for traditional applications, we are engaged in discussions regarding the supply of low-carbon ammonia for new applications. We are evaluating and are in various stages of discussions with other companies for long-term offtake and/or potential joint investments related to new and traditional applications for low-carbon ammonia. These discussions continue to advance as we gain greater clarity regarding demand for low-carbon ammonia, including associated carbon intensity requirements, government incentives and regulatory developments.\nMarket Conditions and Current Developments\nSince January 20, 2025, the Trump administration has imposed, modified and proposed additional tariffs on a range of products from most countries around the world and has negotiated and is negotiating tariff and trade agreements that have resulted and will continue to result in changes to existing tariffs and other trade policies in the United States and globally. Since March 6, 2025, the United States has excluded from tariffs any products that enter the United States duty-free as a good of Canada pursuant to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, such that U.S. tariffs on Canadian imports are currently not applicable to our Canadian production.\nNegotiations between the United States and several countries are ongoing that may change the magnitude, the timing or other aspects of tariffs between these countries. In addition, some of these tariffs have been the subject of litigation, which is ongoing, and may result in the elimination of, or other changes to, some tariffs. In particular, the U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing the imposition of reciprocal tariffs and tariffs on Canada and Mexico, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, with a decision expected in 2026.\nAny of the proposed or enacted tariffs and changes to U.S. trading policies may be reinstituted, paused, removed or changed at any time and may be done unpredictably and without notice. Retaliatory tariffs or other imposition of taxes and duties on U.S. exports to trading partners may also be significant and unpredictable.\nAny imposed tariffs or the prospect of any retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, changes in U.S. trade policy or changes in other countries’ trade policies with the United States has and may continue to lead to uncertainty in the global marketplace, impact the supply and demand balance in many regions, and increase the cost of capital equipment and other supplies, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nU.S. Tax Legislation\nOn July 4, 2025, H.R.1 - One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the Act) was enacted into law. The Act makes permanent certain elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including 100% bonus depreciation on qualified property, and modifies several international tax provisions, including the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions becoming effective in fiscal year 2025 and the majority taking effect in future years. The impacts of the Act are reflected in our results for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and did not have a material impact on our income tax expense. However, we expect certain provisions of the Act will affect the timing of cash tax payments in the current fiscal year and future periods.\nNitrogen Selling Prices\nOur nitrogen products are globally traded commodities with selling prices that fluctuate in response to global market conditions, changes in supply and demand, and other cost factors including domestic and local conditions. Intense global competition—reflected in import volumes and prices—strongly influences delivered prices for nitrogen fertilizers. In general, the prevailing global prices for nitrogen products must be at a level to incent the high-cost marginal producer to produce products at a breakeven price or above, or else they would cease production and leave a portion of global demand unsatisfied.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the average selling price for our products was $368 per ton, or 29% higher, compared to $286 per ton in the third quarter of 2024. This resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately $370 million for the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024. Average selling prices for all of our major products were higher in the third quarter of 2025 than in the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to strong demand for all nitrogen products, supply disruptions\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nAverage daily market price of natural gas at the Henry Hub (per MMBtu)\nCost of natural gas used for production in cost of sales\n___________________________________________________________________________\nIncludes the cost of natural gas used for production and related transportation that is included in cost of sales during the period under the first-in, first-out inventory cost method.\nIn the third quarter of 2025, our cost of natural gas used for production, which includes the impact of realized natural gas derivatives, increased 41% to $2.96 per MMBtu from $2.10 per MMBtu in the third quarter of 2024. This increase in natural gas costs resulted in a decrease in gross margin of $73 million compared to the third quarter of 2024. In the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our cost of natural gas used for production, which includes the impact of realized natural gas derivatives, increased 40% to $3.34 per MMBtu from $2.38 per MMBtu in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase in natural gas costs resulted in a decrease in gross margin of $249 million.\nLow-carbon Ammonia Production Section 45Q Tax Credits\nIn July 2025, construction, commissioning and start-up of the dehydration and compression unit at our Donaldsonville complex was completed. Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code provides a tax credit per metric ton of CO\ncaptured and disposed of in secure geological storage. As a result, in the third quarter of 2025, we earned approximately $20 million of 45Q tax credits, which is recorded in other operating—net in our consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nFinancial Executive Summary\nWe reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $353 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $276 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase in net earnings of $77 million, or 28%. The increase in net earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to an increase in gross margin of $188 million and $20 million of income for 45Q tax credits earned in the three months ended September 30, 2025. These factors that increased net earnings attributable to common stockholders were partially offset by (i) higher interest expense as the third quarter of 2024 included a benefit related to discretionary interest relief granted to us on certain Canadian tax matters, (ii) a higher income tax provision due to higher net earnings in the third quarter of 2025, and (iii) higher net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nGross margin increased by $188 million, or 42%, to $632 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $444 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to a 29% increase in average selling prices to $368 per ton in the third quarter of 2025 from $286 per ton in the third quarter of 2024, which increased gross margin by $370 million, partially offset by higher natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, which decreased gross margin by $73 million, lower sales volume, which decreased gross margin by $37 million, and higher costs associated with maintenance activity in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nDiluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders increased $0.64 per share, or 41%, to $2.19 per share in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $1.55 per share in the third quarter of 2024, due to higher net earnings and lower weighted-average common shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program. Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding were 161.2 million shares for the three months ended September 30, 2025, a decrease of 10% compared to diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding of 178.6 million shares for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n\nItems Affecting Comparability of Results\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $353 million and $276 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $1.05 billion and $890 million, respectively. In addition to the impact of market conditions and current developments, including the 45Q tax credit income, discussed above, certain items affected the comparability of our financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. The following table and related discussion outline these items and their impac"
