Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nCarrier Global Corporation (\"we\" or \"our\") is a global leader in intelligent climate and energy solutions with a focus on providing differentiated, digitally-enabled lifecycle solutions to our customers. Our portfolio includes industry-leading brands such as Carrier, Viessmann, Toshiba, Automated Logic and Carrier Transicold that offer innovative heating, ventilating, air conditioning (\"HVAC\") and cold chain transportation solutions to enhance the lives we live and the world we share. We also provide a broad array of related building services, including audit, design, installation, system integration, repair, maintenance and monitoring. Our operations are classified into four segments: Climate Solutions Americas, Climate Solutions Europe, Climate Solutions Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa and Climate Solutions Transportation.\nThrough our performance-driven culture, we anticipate creating long-term shareowner value by investing strategically to strengthen our product position in homes, buildings and across the cold chain in order to drive profitable growth. We believe our business segments are well positioned to benefit from favorable secular trends, including the mega-trends of urbanization, population growth and demographic shifts, food security and safety, digitalization, global connectivity and energy efficiency. Coupled with our industry-leading brands and track record of innovation, we continue to provide market-leading solutions for our customers.\nOur worldwide operations are affected by global and regional industrial, economic and political factors, trade policies and trends. They are also affected by changes in the general level of economic activity, such as changes in business and consumer spending, construction and shipping activity as well as short-term economic factors such as currency fluctuations, commodity price volatility and supply disruptions. We continue to invest in our business, take pricing actions to mitigate supply chain and inflationary pressures, develop new products and services in order to remain competitive in our markets and use risk management strategies to mitigate various exposures.\nWe continue to actively monitor evolving macroeconomic conditions and recent trade policy announcements. Based on our updated analysis, we expect to fully mitigate our expected 2025 impact from tariffs announced to date through supply chain and productivity actions as well as approximately $200 million of incremental product pricing actions. To date, tariffs have not had a material impact on our business and we are deploying additional strategies, including cost containment measures, to limit future exposure in this current market environment.\nPortfolio Transformation\nDuring 2024, we completed several activities designed to simplify our business portfolio, transforming it into a pure-play climate and energy solutions provider. On January 2, 2024, we acquired the climate solutions business (the \"VCS Business\") of Viessmann Group GmbH & Co. KG (together with its affiliates, “Viessmann”). The VCS Business, primarily reported in the Climate Solutions Europe segment, is a premier residential and light commercial HVAC provider in Europe that expanded our portfolio to offer a global, comprehensive suite of sustainable and innovative building and cold-chain solutions. In addition, we divested our Commercial and Residential Fire, Access Solutions and Industrial Fire businesses which were historically reported in our Fire & Security segment. The transactions represented a single disposal plan to separately divest multiple businesses over different reporting periods and met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. We also divested our Commercial Refrigeration business (“CCR”) during 2024. CCR, which was historically reported in the Climate Solutions Transportation segment (previously named Refrigeration), did not meet the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations.\nSegment Reorganization\nAs a result of our portfolio transformation, we revised our reportable segments during the first quarter of 2025 to better reflect our business strategy, align our management reporting and increase transparency for investors. Under the revised segment structure, we have three new regional HVAC operating segments. Combined with the existing Climate Solutions Transportation operating segment, the four operating segments also serve as our reportable segments. This model is designed to create a simplified, more focused and customer-centric organization across the globe. Each segment reports through separate management teams which regularly review their operating results with our Chief Operating Decision Maker (the \"CODM\") determined in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. In connection with the revised structure, the CODM changed the measure used to evaluate segment profitability from\nSegment operating profit.\nAll prior period comparative information has been recast to reflect the revised segment structure.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nPreparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses. We believe that the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their potential significance to the accompanying Unaudited Condensed\nFinancial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. In \"\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\"\ndescribe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in the preparation of the accompanying Unaudited Condensed\nFinancial Statements. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nThe following represents our consolidated net sales and operating results:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nCost of products and services sold\nNon-operating income (expense), net\nEarnings (loss) before income taxes\nEarnings (loss) from continuing operations\nDiscontinued operations, net of income taxes\nLess: Non-controlling interest in subsidiaries' earnings from operations\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to common shareowners\n\nPercentage of net sales\nGross margin decreased by $228 million compared with the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to lower volumes in certain end-markets. As a result, gross margin as a percentage of\ndecreased by 200 basis points compared with the same period of 2024. The prior period included inventory step-up and backlog amortization resulting from the recognition of acquired assets of the VCS Business at fair value which are now fully amortized. These costs had a 50 basis point unfavorable impact on the prior period gross margin as a percentage of\n. The decrease was partially offset by ongoing customer demand in certain end-markets and our continued focus on productivity initiatives.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025, operating expenses, including\nEquity method investment net earnings\n, were $910 million, flat compared with the same period of 2024. The components\nSelling, general and administrative\nResearch and development\nEquity method investment net earnings\nOther income (expense), net\nTotal operating expenses\nPercentage of net sales\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025,\nSelling, general and administrative\nexpenses were $803 million, a 1% increase compared with the same period of 2024. The increase primarily relates to foreign currency translation. In addition, employee-related costs associated with our portfolio transformation further impacted results. These costs were partially offset by lower compensation costs and synergies associated with the integration of the VCS Business. The current period also included $13 million of acquisition and divestiture-related costs compared with $15 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nResearch and development\ncosts relate to new product development and new technology innovation. Due to the variable nature of program development schedules, year-over-year spending levels can fluctuate. In addition, we continue to invest to prepare for future product innovations and digital controls technologies.\nInvestments over which we do not exercise control, but have significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For the three months ended September 30, 2025,\nEquity method investment net earnings\nwere $60 million, a 9% decrease compared with the same period of 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by lower earnings in joint ventures within Climate Solutions Americas.\nOther income (expense), net\nprimarily includes the impact of gains and losses related to the sale of businesses or interests in our equity method investments, foreign currency gains and losses on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency and hedging-related activities.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense), net\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2025,\nNon-operating income (expense), net\nwas $106 million, a 1,614% decrease compared with the same period of 2024. The components were as follows:\nNon-service pension (expense) benefit\nInterest (expense) income, net\n\nWe account for income tax expense in accordance with ASC 740, which requires an estimate of the annual effective income tax rate for the full year to be applied to the respective interim period, taking into account year-to-date amounts and projected results for the full year.\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025, was a 0.2% benefit compared with 22.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2024.
