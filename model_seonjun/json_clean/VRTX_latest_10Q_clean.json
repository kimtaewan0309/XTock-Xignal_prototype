Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases, with a focus on specialty markets. We have seven approved medicines: five that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (“CF”), a life-threatening genetic disease, one that treats severe sickle cell disease (“SCD”) and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia (“TDT”), life shortening inherited blood disorders, and one that treats moderate-to-severe acute pain. Our clinical-stage pipeline includes programs in CF, SCD, beta thalassemia, neuropathic pain, type 1 diabetes, IgA nephropathy, primary membranous nephropathy and other autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1.\nIn December 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approved ALYFTREK (vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor), our once-daily next-in-class triple combination for the treatment of people with CF 6 years of age and older, and our fifth CF medicine. ALYFTREK is also approved in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), the European Union (“E.U.”), Canada, New Zealand and Switzerland. Collectively, our five medicines, led by TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), are being used to treat more than three quarters of the approximately 94,000 people with CF in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Canada.\nCASGEVY (exagamglogene autotemcel), our ex-vivo, non-viral CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited cell therapy, is approved in the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (“Saudi Arabia”), the Kingdom of Bahrain (“Bahrain”), Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (the “UAE”), Switzerland and Canada for the treatment of people 12 years of age and older with SCD or TDT. We estimate approximately 60,000 people with severe SCD or TDT are or could become eligible for CASGEVY in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and the Middle East.\nIn January 2025, the FDA approved JOURNAVX, our selective non-opioid NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor, for the treatment of people with moderate-to-severe acute pain. We have begun our commercial launch of JOURNAVX in the U.S. for eligible adults.\nFinancial Highlights\nIn the third quarter of 2025, our net product revenues increased to $3.1 billion as compared to $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to continued strong patient demand for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO and early contributions from three ongoing launches.\nOur total research and development (“R&D”), acquired in-process research and development (“AIPR&D”), and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased to $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to increased commercial investments to support the launch of JOURNAVX, continued investment in support of multiple mid-to-late stage clinical development programs, and higher AIPR&D. Cost of sales was 13.5% and 14.2% in the third quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nOur total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased to $12.0 billion as of September 30, 2025 as compared to $11.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 primarily due to cash flows provided by our operating activities partially offset by repurchases of our common stock.\nNote: Charts above may not add due to rounding.\nWe expect that the number of people with CF taking our medicines will continue to grow through new approvals and reimbursement agreements, treatment of younger patients, increased survival and expansion into additional geographies. Recent and anticipated progress in activities expanding our CF business is included below:\nMedsafe New Zealand and Swissmedic approved ALYFTREK for the treatment of people with CF ages 6 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation or another responsive mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”) gene.\nRegulatory submissions for ALYFTREK are under review in Australia.\nEligible people with CF in England, Ireland, Germany, Denmark and Northern Ireland have reimbursed access to ALYFTREK, and we are working to secure access for eligible patients in additional countries.\nSickle Cell Disease and Beta Thalassemia\nIn September, we secured reimbursement for CASGEVY for people with SCD and TDT in Italy. Italy has the largest population of people living with TDT in Europe, with approximately 5,000 people 12 years of age and older with TDT and approximately 2,300 people 12 years of age and older with SCD.\nGlobally, since launch through September 30, 2025, approximately 165 people with SCD or TDT have had their first cell collection for CASGEVY, including 50 people in the third quarter of 2025, and 39 people with SCD or TDT have received infusions of CASGEVY, including 10 people infused in the third quarter of 2025.\nSince JOURNAVX became available at pharmacies in March, through mid-October more than 300,000 prescriptions for JOURNAVX have been written and filled across the hospital and retail settings in different acute pain conditions, consistent with its broad label.\nAs of mid-October, across commercial and government payers, more than 170 million individuals have covered access to JOURNAVX, representing more than half of U.S. covered lives. This includes formal coverage with two of the three large national pharmacy benefit managers and unrestricted access within 19 state Medicaid plans. We expect access to JOURNAVX to continue to expand over the remainder of 2025 and into 2026.\nApproximately 90 of the targeted 150 large healthcare systems and more than 750 individual hospitals of the 2,000 targeted institutions have added JOURNAVX to formularies, protocols or order sets.\nWe continue to advance a diversified pipeline of potentially transformative medicines for serious diseases utilizing a range of modalities. Recent and anticipated progress in activities supporting these efforts is included below:\nIn October, we completed the pivotal clinical trial of TRIKAFTA in children 12 months to less than 24 months of age. The data showed that TRIKAFTA was generally safe and well-tolerated, consistent with the established safety profile. We expect to submit for approval in this age group with global regulators in the first half of 2026.\nWe have completed enrollment in a global trial evaluating ALYFTREK in children 2 to 5 years of age. In this pivotal clinical trial, approximately 65 children will receive ALYFTREK for 24 weeks. We expect to share data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2026.\nSickle Cell Disease and Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia\nWe have completed enrollment in two global Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating CASGEVY in children 5 to 11 years of age with SCD or TDT and expect to complete dosing in the fourth quarter of 2025. We expect to share emerging data from these clinical trials in an upcoming medical conference.\nPeripheral Neuropathic Pain\nWe previously initiated the first Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating suzetrigine for the treatment of people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain, and we expect to start the second Phase 3 clinical trial in November. We expect to complete enrollment in both Phase 3 clinical trials by the end of 2026.\nZimislecel is an allogeneic, stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell replacement therapy, using standard immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells. We have completed enrollment in the Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial of zimislecel in people with type 1 diabetes (“T1D”). We have temporarily postponed completion of the dosing in this clinical trial, pending an internal manufacturing analysis.\nIgA Nephropathy, Primary Membranous Nephropathy and Other B Cell-Mediated Diseases\nWe are developing povetacicept, a dual inhibitor of B cell activating factor (“BAFF”) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (“APRIL”) cytokines, for multiple diseases. Povetacicept represents a potentially best-in-class approach to control B cell activity in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (“IgAN”) and primary membranous nephropathy (“pMN”), and we believe it has pipeline-in-a-product potential.\nThe FDA has granted a rolling review to the Biologics Licensing Application (“BLA”) submission for povetacicept for the treatment of IgAN. We have completed enrollment of the interim analysis cohort for potential accelerated approval in the U.S., and we have completed the clinical trials to support the launch of povetacicept for monthly, at-home self-administration with an autoinjector. We expect to submit the first module of the IgAN BLA to the FDA before the end of 2025, and we expect to complete the full BLA submission in the first half of 2026 for potential accelerated approval in the U.S. In addition, we have completed full enrollment of the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating IgAN.\nWe have initiated the Phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial of povetacicept for the treatment of people with pMN.\nAPOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease\nInaxaplin is our small molecule for the treatment of APOL1-mediated kidney disease (“AMKD”). We completed enrollment in the interim analysis cohort of the global Phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial evaluating inaxaplin (“AMPLITUDE”). We expect to conduct the pre-planned interim analysis once this cohort has been treated for 48 weeks, with potential to file for accelerated approval in the U.S. if the results are supportive.\nOur Business Environment\nIn the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our net product revenues came primarily from the sale of our medicines for the treatment of CF. Our CF strategy involves continuing to develop and obtain approval and reimbursement for treatment\nregimens that will provide benefits to all people with CF and increasing the number of people with CF eligible and able to rec"
