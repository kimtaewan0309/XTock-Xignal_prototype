FX-adjusted Total revenues net of interest expense and Total loans and Card Member receivables are non-GAAP measures. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nRepresents net income, less (i) earnings allocated to participating share awards of $20 million and $18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $56 million and $59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and (ii) dividends on preferred shares of $14 million and $15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $43 million and $44 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nTotal loans reflects Card Member loans and Other loans.\nRepresents net interest income, computed on an annualized basis, divided by average Card Member loans, Card Member loans HFS, Other loans and Card Member receivables.\nWe present a net write-off rate based on principal losses only (i.e., excluding interest and/or fees) to be consistent with industry convention. In addition, as our practice is to include uncollectible interest and/or fees as part of our total provision for credit losses, a net write-off rate including principal, interest and/or fees is also presented.\nA net write-off rate based on principal losses only is not available for corporate receivables due to system constraints.\nFor corporate receivables, delinquency data is tracked based on days past billing status rather than days past due. Refer to Table 11 for 90+ days past billing metrics for corporate receivables.\nReturn on average equity (ROE) is calculated by dividing (i) annualized net income for the period by (ii) average shareholders’ equity for the period.\nBusiness Performance\nWe delivered strong results for the third quarter of 2025, with record levels of Card Member spending and excellent credit performance. During the quarter, we launched our refreshed U.S. Consumer and Business Platinum Cards with expanded lifestyle and business benefits and have seen strong early demand and engagement. Net income for the third quarter was $2.9 billion, or $4.14 per share, compared with net income of $2.5 billion, or $3.49 per share, a year ago.\nBilled business growth accelerated to 9 percent year-over-year (8 percent on an FX-adjusted basis).\nG&S spend grew 9 percent, driven by strong retail spending, and T&E spend rebounded to 8 percent, primarily reflecting continuing strength in restaurant spend, our largest T&E spend category, as well as improved airline spend. U.S. Consumer Services billed business grew 9 percent, with continued strength in spending by Millennial and Gen-Z Card Members as our products continue to resonate with these cohorts. Commercial Services billed business grew 4 percent, reflecting continued modest growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) Card Members. International Card Services billed business grew 14 percent (13 percent on an FX-adjusted basis), driven by continued strong growth in spend across all regions and customer types outside the United States.\nTotal spend continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10 percent in the quarter, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base.\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 11 percent year-over-year on both a reported and FX-adjusted basis.\nGrowth in billed business drove a 7 percent increase in Discount revenue, our largest revenue line. Net card fee revenue growth moderated from the prior quarter due to our previous cycle of product refreshes. In connection with the launch of our updated U.S. Consumer and Business Platinum Cards, we increased the annual card fee, which will be applied for existing Card Members at renewal anniversaries after the applicable effective date and recognized over the annual card membership period. Service fees and other revenue grew at an elevated level, reflecting discrete transactions in the quarter. Net interest income grew 12 percent, primarily reflecting growth in balances and net yield expansion.\nTotal Loans and Card Member receivables increased 7 percent year-over-year, in line with recent trends. Provisions for credit losses decreased, primarily due to a lower reserve build compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher net write-offs. Net write-off and delinquency rates remained stable and best-in-class, supported by our premium global customer base, our strong focus on risk management and disciplined growth strategy.\nCard Member rewards, Card Member services and Business development expenses, which are generally driven by volumes and usage, collectively grew faster than revenues as a result of enhancements to our value propositions, such as the expanded U.S. Platinum benefits, to drive Card Member engagement and acquire more Card Members, and the mix shift towards premium products. Marketing expense increased 9 percent year-over-year, as we continued to invest to acquire high spending, high credit-quality customers. During the third quarter, we acquired 3.2 million proprietary new cards. Operating expense growth continues to reflect our investments in enterprise risk management capabilities and technology to support business growth. We remain focused on driving marketing and operating expense efficiencies over time.\nDuring the third quarter, we maintained our CET1 capital ratio within our target range of 10 to 11 percent and returned $2.9 billion of capital to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while managing our CET1 capital ratio within our target range and supporting balance sheet growth. Our robust capital, funding and liquidity positions provide us with significant flexibility to maintain a strong balance sheet.\nOur strong third quarter performance continues to give us confidence in our Membership-focused business model and proven product refresh strategy as we navigate the evolving competitive landscape. While we recognize the uncertainty of the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, we believe our differentiated business model, which includes our global premium customer base, spend- and fee-centric revenue mix and operating expense leverage, is resilient and positions us well to navigate a range of economic environments. We continue to manage the company for the long term, focusing on backing our customers and colleagues, exercising disciplined expense management and strategically investing in our business.\nSee “Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments” for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for information on potential impacts of macroeconomic, geopolitical and competitive conditions and certain litigation and regulatory matters on our business.\n\n— Represents the number of new cards issued by American Express during the referenced period, net of replacement cards. Proprietary new cards acquired is useful as a measure of the effectiveness of our customer acquisition strategy.\nReserve build (release)\n— Represents the portion of the provisions for credit losses for the period related to increasing or decreasing reserves for credit losses as a result of, among other things, changes in volumes, macroeconomic outlook, portfolio composition and credit quality of portfolios. Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net write-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net write-offs exceed the provision for credit losses.\n— Represents spend on travel and entertainment, which primarily includes airline, cruise, lodging and dining merchant categories.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.
