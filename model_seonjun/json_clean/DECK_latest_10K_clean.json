BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nWe are a global leader in designing, marketing, and distributing innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high-performance activities. We market our products primarily under five proprietary brands: UGG, HOKA, Teva, AHNU, and Koolaburra. Our brands compete across the fashion and casual lifestyle, performance, running, and outdoor markets. We believe our products are distinctive and appeal to a broad demographic. Our brands sell our products through quality domestic and international retailers, international distributors, and directly to global consumers through our Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channel, which is comprised of an e‑commerce and retail store presence. We seek to differentiate our brands and products by offering diverse lines that emphasize fashion, authenticity, functionality, quality, and comfort, and products tailored to a variety of activities, seasons, and demographic groups. Independent third-party contractors manufacture all of our products (independent manufacturers).\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, we began taking steps to phase out our standalone operations for the Koolaburra brand in order to maintain focus on our most significant organic opportunities. We closed Koolaburra.com as of March 31, 2025, and plan to wind down the Koolaburra brand in the wholesale channel by the end of calendar year 2025. Refer to the section titled “The Company,” in Note 1, “General,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information.\nSanuk Brand Asset Sale.\nWe completed the sale of our Sanuk brand and certain related assets on August 15, 2024 (Sanuk Brand Sale Date). Refer to the section titled “The Company,” in Note 1, “General,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on the sale of Sanuk brand.\nForward Stock Split and Authorized Share Increase.\nOn September 13, 2024, we effected a stock split and an authorized share increase. Our financial results included within this Annual Report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effectiveness of the stock split and the authorized share increase. Refer to the section titled “Basis of Presentation,” in Note 1, “General,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information.\nBRANDS\nUGG.\nThe UGG brand is one of the most iconic and recognized footwear brands in our industry, which highlights our successful track record of building niche brands into lifestyle and fashion market leaders. With loyal consumers around the world, the UGG brand has proven to be a highly resilient consumer-focused line of premium footwear, apparel, and accessories with year-round product offerings that appeal to a growing global audience and a broad demographic.\nHOKA\nThe HOKA brand is an authentic premium line of year-round performance footwear, which offers enhanced cushioning and inherent stability with minimal weight. Originally designed for ultra-runners, the brand now appeals to world champions, taste makers, and everyday athletes. Expanded marketing and strategic marketplace presence have fueled both domestic and international sales growth of the HOKA brand, which has quickly become a leading brand within run and outdoor specialty wholesale accounts and is growing across its global marketplace. The HOKA brand’s product line includes running, trail, hiking, fitness, and lifestyle footwear offerings, as well as select apparel and accessories.\nOther brands consist primarily of the Teva brand, AHNU brand, and Koolaburra brand. The Teva brand’s products are built for a range of outdoor pursuits and include a variety of footwear options, from classic sandals and shoes to boots. The AHNU brand’s footwear products fuse high-performance technology with timeless style crafted for everyday wear. The Koolaburra brand, for which we are phasing out standalone operations by the end of calendar year 2025, is a casual footwear brand that uses plush materials to target value-oriented consumers.\nAs discussed under the section titled “Recent Developments” above, the sale of the Sanuk brand was completed during fiscal year 2025. The financial results for our reportable operating segments present the former Sanuk brand within the Other brands reportable operating segment through the Sanuk Brand Sale Date for the year ended March 31, 2025, and full financial results for the years ended March 31, 2024, and 2023. Refer to the section titled “Reportable Operating Segments” below for further details about our reportable operating segments.\nCHANNEL DISTRIBUTION\nOur wholesale channel sells products to a network of third-party retailers, including partner retailers, and distributors. This approach enables us to expand market reach and leverage the scale and operational capabilities of its wholesale partners to serve a broad base of end consumers.\nWe sell our UGG brand products primarily through fashion lifestyle retailers, higher-end department stores, streetwear and sports style partners, online retailers and partner retailers. As the retail marketplace continues to evolve to reflect changing consumer preferences, we continually review and evaluate our UGG wholesale distribution and product segmentation approach.\nWe sell our HOKA brand products primarily through full-service specialty retailers, outdoor and sporting goods retailers, select online retailers, fashion lifestyle retailers, sports style partners, and higher-end department stores. We continue to expand our HOKA brand wholesale distribution globally, including through additional mono-branded locations operated by partner retailers.\nWe sell our Teva brand products primarily through outdoor and sporting goods retailers, fashion lifestyle retailers, large national retail chains, higher-end department stores, and online retailers. We sell our AHNU brand footwear through domestic streetwear and lifestyle boutiques and retailers.\nOur DTC channel is comprised of our Company-owned e-commerce websites and retail stores where products are sold at retail prices. Our e-commerce websites and retail stores are intertwined and interdependent in an omni-channel marketplace, providing a fluid purchasing experience, which engenders brand loyalty while increasing product sales and improving our inventory productivity. In addition, we believe many of our consumers interact with both before making purchasing decisions in store and online. For example, consumers may feel or try on products in our retail stores and then place an order online later. Conversely, they may initially research products online and then view inventory availability by store location and make a purchase in store.\nE-Commerce Websites.\nOur global e-commerce websites provide us with an opportunity to directly engage and connect with our consumers and communicate a consistent message that promotes awareness of our brands’ promises and key initiatives, offers targeted information to specific consumer demographics, and drives consumers to our retail stores. As of March 31, 2025, we operate Company-owned e-commerce websites in 56 different countries.\nRetail stores enable us to expose consumers to a curated selection of products and directly influence our consumers’ experience with our brands. Our Company-owned mono-branded retail stores are predominantly UGG brand concept and outlet stores, as well as HOKA brand concept stores, which we continue to open in key markets to further grow our brand presence and appeal to a broader consumer base. As of March 31, 2025, we have a total of\n\nRetail store definitions are as follows:\nConcept stores are Company-owned mono-branded stores launched in strategic locations, designed to offer a curated, themed experience and a unique selection of products, aiming to evoke a specific lifestyle for our brands. Concept stores include the following:\nPremium mono-branded stores in key global markets, such as major tourist locations typically with above average square footage, designed to provide broader product offerings and generate greater traffic that enhances the consumer experience and increases brand loyalty.\nShop-in-shop (SIS) Stores.\nSIS stores are operated by us or non-employees within a department store, which we lease from the store owner by paying a percentage of store sales and for which we own the inventory.\nOutlet stores are Company-owned stores designed to sell certain discontinued styles from prior seasons, full price in-line products, and products made specifically for the outlet stores.\nGEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION\nIn our wholesale channel, we sell our products in the US through sales representatives, organized by brand and either geography or account type, as each brand generally has certain specialty customers that expect a dedicated sales team with specialized knowledge of the brand’s product offerings. In addition to our wholesale channel, we sell products directly to consumers through our DTC channel and fulfill online orders through our warehouses, DCs, and retail stores.\nWe currently distribute products sold in the US through our DCs in Moreno Valley, California, and Mooresville, Indiana. We also distribute products to our wholesale channel customers through a DC bypass program. Our warehouses and DCs feature a warehouse management system that enables us to efficiently pick and pack products for direct shipment to customers and consumers.\nInternational Distribution.\nCollectively, our brands are sold internationally in Canada, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. We sell our products internationally in our wholesale channel through wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors, some of which operate partner retail stores. In addition, in certain countries we sell products through our DTC channel. For our wholesale and DTC channels, we distribute our products through a number of warehouses and DCs managed by 3PLs in certain international locations.\nRefer to Part I, Item 2, “Properties,” and Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on our properties and related minimum lease and other commitments. Refer to Note 13, “Concentration of Business,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for additional information regarding geographic areas and concentration of related business risks.\nREPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we updated our reportable operating segments to better reflect changes in the way our CODM makes resource allocation decisions and assesses performance. In connection with executive leadership alignment, and the recent divestiture and phase out of certain brands, the CODM shifted resource allocation decisions and performance assessment to a brand focus, rather than a distribution channel focus. As of March 31, 2025, our three reportable operating segments include the worldwide operations of the UGG brand, HOKA brand, and Other brands (collectively, our reportable operating segments).\nRefer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the section titled “Basis of Presentation,” in Note 1, “General,” and to Note 12, “Reportable Operating Segments,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for additional information regarding the recent change in our reportable operating segments and our results of operations.\nPRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT\nOur design and development teams work closely with each brand’s product management teams to create seasonal product lines designed to meet and exceed consumer expectations. Each brand follows a similar product creation path starting with consumer insights, including engagement with key consumer segments, color, trend, mate",

We closed Koolaburra.com as of March 31, 2025, and plan to wind down the Koolaburra brand in the wholesale channel by the end of calendar year 2025.

Refer to the section titled “Basis of Presentation,” in Note 1, “General,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information.\nTRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nWe expect our business and industry will continue to be impacted by several important trends and uncertainties, including the following:\nMacroeconomic and Geopolitical Factors\nWe are exposed to risks resulting from evolving US trade policy that has introduced uncertainty and volatility in global trade relations, including higher tariffs and greater restrictions on goods imported from certain regions. While we pursue mitigation strategies, including through selective, staggered, and strategic price increases on our products sold in the US and by negotiating cost-sharing arrangements with our independent manufacturers, we may be unable to offset all resulting\nincreases to our cost of goods sold. These risks may have a material adverse impact on demand for our products.\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflationary pressures, increased tariffs, geopolitical unrest, and escalating global conflicts, are creating a complex and challenging environment for our business and industry. While these factors did not materially impact our business or results of operations during fiscal year 2025, the full impact of these factors is difficult to quantify and could negatively impact us in future periods.\nBrand and Omni-Channel Strategy\nWe remain focused on increasing global consumer awareness and adoption of our brands, which has continued to positively impact our financial results. Our efforts to drive brand adoption are focused on building brand acceptance and heat through launches of innovative product offerings, coupled with marketing investments across multiple geographic markets and channels of distribution, including strategic expansion of the global marketplace.\nWe continue to implement a marketplace inventory management strategy for our brands through segmentation and differentiation. During fiscal year 2025, we continued to experience alignment on product assortments that resulted in higher full-price sell-through, which benefited our gross margins across all channels of distribution. While gross margins continue to be an area of strategic focus, we may not experience these benefits to our gross margins in our fiscal year ending March 31, 2026 (next fiscal year) due to various factors, including impacts from macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, discussed above, as well as potential impacts from our pricing strategies.\nOur long-term strategy remains focused on building our DTC channel to represent an increased proportion of our total net sales, which includes differentiating the consumer experience from the wholesale channel to drive increases in acquisition and retention to sustain strong market positions and a high level of demand for our brands. We expect increased sales in the DTC channel will continue to positively impact our gross margins. However, as we expand doors with wholesale partners to drive brand awareness and market share in the near-term, our wholesale channel may represent a higher portion of our total net sales in certain periods, which could pressure our margins in those periods.\nWe continue to implement our international growth strategies for the HOKA and UGG brands to represent an increased proportion of our total net sales. We continue to selectively expand our HOKA brand presence through additional locations with our wholesale partners and targeted retail store expansion within our DTC channel. We also continue to invest in certain regions that provide influential market presence to build HOKA brand awareness, and we expect to continue making these investments, including in our next fiscal year. We continue to emphasize elevating the customer experience for our brands through category expansion and collaborations.\nTo support our growing business, we continue to invest in our network of global warehouses, DCs, and 3PLs, which have fixed and variable costs, with variable costs changing relative to changes in net sales. We continue to diversify our third-party manufacturers and the regions in which they operate. We are currently negotiating the transition of one of our international 3PLs to a new partner with an upgraded warehouse management system during our next fiscal year. We expect to continue to invest in and build upon these infrastructure capabilities to continue meeting customer and consumer demand.\nREPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS OVERVIEW\nAs of March 31, 2025, our three reportable operating segments include the worldwide operations of the UGG brand, HOKA brand, and Other brands. Information reported to the CODM, who is our Principal Executive Officer (PEO), is organized into these reportable operating segments and is consistent with how the CODM evaluates our performance and allocates resources.\nChange in Reportable Operating Segments.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the financial information regularly used by the CODM to evaluate performance, make operating decisions, and allocate resources was revised. In connection with executive leadership alignment, and the recent divestiture and phase out of certain brands, the CODM shifted resource allocation decisions and performance assessment to a brand focus, rather than a distribution channel focus. This resulted in a change in our reportable operating segments. The change in reportable operating segments had an impact on segment income from operations, a measure of segment profitability, and we clarified unallocated overhead costs excluded from this measure as unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses. Unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses are costs that are managed centrally and not specific to any one brand. These costs are primarily comprised of certain payroll and related expenses, including stock-based compensation; global IT expenses; 3PL service fees; depreciation, rent, and occupancy for owned warehouses and offices; and other SG&A expenses, such as costs for contract services, materials, supplies, and travel. These costs span multiple functions including owned warehouses and 3PL service fees, along with enterprise costs which include centralized commercial operations, IT, finance, human resources, legal, supply chain, and corporate executives.\nPreviously, our six reportable operating segments included the worldwide wholesale operations of the UGG brand, HOKA brand, Teva brand, Sanuk brand, and Other brands (primarily the AHNU brand and Koolaburra brand), and DTC. Reportable operating segment results for all prior periods presented in this Annual Report have been recast to reflect the change in reportable operating segments.\nAs discussed under the section titled “Recent Developments” above, the sale of the Sanuk brand was completed during fiscal year 2025. The financial results for our reportable operating segments present the former Sanuk brand within the Other brands reportable operating segment through the Sanuk Brand Sale Date for the year ended March 31, 2025, and full financial results for the years ended March 31, 2024, and 2023.\nRefer to Note 12, “Reportable Operating Segments,”\nof our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report\nfor further information on reportable operating segments.\n\nIncludes Sanuk brand partial financial results through the Sanuk Brand Sale Date of August 15, 2024, for the year ended March 31, 2025, and full financial results for the prior period, which are presented in the Other brands reportable operating segment. Refer to the section titled “Recent Developments” above for further information on the sale of the Sanuk brand. Refer to the section titled “Reportable Operating Segments Overview,” above for further information on the recent change in our reportable operating segments.\nIncludes Teva brand full financial results for the year ended March 31, 2025, and the prior period, which are presented in the Other brands reportable operating segment. Refer to the section titled “Reportable Operating Segments Overview” above for further information on the recent change in our reportable operating segments.\nTo the extent that consolidated SG&A expenses exceed reportable operating segment SG&A expenses, the costs are recorded in unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses, which are costs that are managed centrally and not specific to any one brand. The change in reportable operating segments had an impact on segment income from operations, a measure of segment profitability, and a clarification was made that certain prior unallocated overhead costs are defined as unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability.\nThe increase in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.\nDrivers of significant net changes in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, were as follows:\nThe increase in income from operations of the UGG brand was due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, as well as relatively flat SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.\nThe increase in income from operations of the HOKA brand was due to higher net sales at slightly lower gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, primarily reflecting increased marketing and headcount to support brand growth initiatives.\nThe increase in income from operations of the Other brands was due to higher gross margins on lower net sales, as well as the benefit to SG&A expenses from lower impairments compared to the prior period for the Sanuk brand definite-lived intangible assets.\nThe increase in unallocated enterprise and shared brand expenses was due to higher other SG&A expenses for 3PL service fees, contract services, and IT programming and software costs; higher payroll and related costs for higher variable payroll costs along with higher headcount for enterprise functions; and higher depreciation and other related costs for infrastructure investments.\nTotal Other Income, Net.\nThe increase in total other income, net, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher interest income from higher invested cash balances.\nIncome tax expense and our effective income tax rate were as follows:\nYears Ended March 31,\nEffective income tax rate\nThe net decrease in our effective income tax rate, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to benefits related to US tax on foreign earnings (including global intangible low-tax income and foreign derived intangible income), partially offset by higher income tax expense from changes in jurisdictional mix of worldwide income before income taxes and a lower benefit from net discrete items, including from return-to-provision adjustments and a valuation allowance on tax attributes.\n\nThe increase in total income from operations, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, was primarily due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.\nDrivers of significant net changes in total income from operations, compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, were as follows:\nThe increase in income from operations of the UGG brand was due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, partially offset by slightly higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.\nThe increase in income from operations of the HOKA brand was due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A expens",
