  "item7_clean": "Gross written premiums increased by 9.6% to $18.2 billion in 2024, compared to $16.6 billion in 2023, reflecting a $1.5 billion, or 12.9% increase in our reinsurance business and a $191 million, or 3.9%, increase in our insurance business. The increase in reinsurance premiums reflects growth across multiple lines of business, particularly property and casualty pro rata business and property catastrophe excess of loss business. The increase in insurance\npremiums reflects growth in property/short tail business and other specialty business, partially offset by portfolio actions taken on accident and health, workers’ compensation and specialty casualty lines of business.\nNet written premiums increased by 7.4% to $15.8 billion in 2024, compared to $14.7 billion in 2023. The current year over prior year increase remained relatively consistent with the percentage increase in gross written premiums.\nPremiums earned increased by 13.0% to $15.2 billion in 2024, compared to $13.4 billion in 2023, which is consistent with the percentage changes in gross written premiums. The change in premiums earned relative to net written premiums was primarily the result of timing; premiums are earned ratably over the coverage period\nwhereas written premiums are generally recorded at the initiation of the coverage period.\nOther Income (Expense).\nWe recorded other income of $121 million and other expense of $14 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change was primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, gain from the sale of the sports and leisure business and gain from pension plan curtailment. We recognized foreign currency exchange income of $58 million in 2024 and foreign currency exchange expense of $24 million in 2023. Additionally, we recognized a $40 million gain on sale of our sports and leisure business, including renewal rights, sold during the fourth quarter and a $9 million pension plan curtailment gain.\nClaims and Expenses.\nIncurred Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses (“LAE”).\nThe following table presents our incurred losses and LAE for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\nIncurred losses and LAE increased by 34.1% to $11.3 billion in 2024, compared to $8.4 billion in 2023, primarily due to an increase of $1.1 billion in current year attritional losses, an increase of $423 million in current year catastrophe losses and unfavorable development on prior year attritional losses of $1.5 billion, partially offset by favorable development on prior year catastrophe losses of $138 million.\nThe increase in current year attritional losses was mainly due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned, changes in the mix of business and strengthening of current accident year U.S. casualty reserves by $206 million in the Insurance\nsegment. The current year catastrophe losses of $893 million in 2024 related primarily to Hurricane Milton ($320 million), Hurricane Helene ($94 million), Hurricane Beryl ($64 million), Hurricane Debby ($56 million), the 2024 European flood Boris ($56 million), the 2024 Baltimore bridge collapse ($55 million), the third quarter 2024 Calgary Alberta storms ($54 million), the 2024 Brazil Floods ($41 million), the 2024 Dubai floods ($32 million), the 2024 Germany floods ($31 million), the 2024 New Caledonia Riots ($31 million) and the 2024 Taiwan earthquake ($27 million), with the remaining losses resulting from various events. The $470 million of current year catastrophe losses in 2023 related primarily to the 2023 Turkey earthquakes ($103 million), Hurricane Otis ($100 million), the 2023 Italy convective storm ($57 million), the 2023 New Zealand storms ($45 million), the 2023 Morocco earthquake ($40 million), the 2023 Hawaii wildfire ($32 million) and Hurricane Idalia ($23 million), with the remaining losses resulting from various storm events.\nUnfavorable development on prior year attritional losses was $1.5 billion in 2024 compared to favorable development of $5 million in 2023. The net unfavorable development on prior year attritional reserves of $1.5 billion in 2024 is comprised of $1.1 billion of unfavorable development on prior years attritional losses from the Insurance segment, mainly driven by a combination of social inflation and portfolio concentrations in certain U.S. casualty lines and $403 million of unfavorable development on prior years attritional losses from the Other segment, mainly related to certain sports and leisure lines for accident years 2019 through 2023, including A&E reserve strengthening of $54 million. In addition, the Reinsurance segment recorded $684 million of unfavorable development on prior year casualty reserves. This unfavorable development in the Reinsurance segment was largely offset by favorable development booked on well-seasoned reserves in the property and mortgage lines.\nCatastrophe losses and loss expenses typically have a material effect on our incurred losses and LAE results and can vary significantly from period to period. Losses from natural catastrophes contributed 5.9 percentage points to the combined ratio in 2024, compared with 3.5 percentage points in 2023.\nRefer to the “Ratios” section for loss ratio analysis discussion.\nCommission, Brokerage, Taxes and Fees.\nCommission, brokerage, taxes and fees increased by 11.8% to $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned and changes in the mix of business. Refer to the “Ratios” section for commission and brokerage ratio analysis discussion.\nOther Underwriting Expenses.\nOther underwriting expenses were $938 million and $846 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in other underwriting expenses was mainly due to the impact of the increase in premiums earned as well as the continued build out of our insurance operations, including an expansion of the international insurance platform. Refer to the “Ratios” section for other underwriting expense ratio analysis discussion.\nCorporate expenses, which are general operating expenses that are not allocated to segments, were $95 million and $73 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to information management related costs, including the acceleration of cybersecurity, corporate applications and infrastructure investments as well as an increase in compensation costs due to increased headcount from the prior year.\nInterest, Fees and Bond Issue Cost Amortization Expense.\nInterest, fees and other bond amortization expense was $149 million and $134 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by higher interest costs resulting from additional borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”), offset by the change in the floating interest rate related to the Company’s outstanding fixed to floating rate long-term subordinated notes, which is reset quarterly per the note agreement. The floating rate was 7.17% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 8.03% as of December 31, 2023.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit).\nEverest had an income tax expense of $120 million and income tax benefit of $363 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. An income tax expense/benefit is primarily a function of the geographic location of the Company’s pre-tax income and the statutory tax rates in those jurisdictions. The effective tax rate (“ETR”) is primarily affected by tax-exempt investment income, foreign tax credits and dividends. Variations in the ETR generally result from changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income, including the impact of catastrophe losses and net capital gains (losses), among jurisdictions with different tax rates. The tax benefit in 2023 was primarily due to the implementation of the provisions of the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023 (“The 2023 Act”).\nOn December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act 2023 (“The 2023 Act”), which will apply a 15% corporate income tax to certain Bermuda businesses in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The 2023 Act includes a provision referred to as “The Economic Transition Adjustment” (the “ETA”), which is intended to provide a fair and equitable transition into the new tax regime, and results in a deferred tax benefit for the Company. However, on January 15, 2025, the OECD issued Guidance related to “deferred tax assets arising from tax benefits provided by General Government” whereby it has restricted the utilization of those deferred tax benefits against the computation of its Pillar Two Global Minimum Taxes to approximately 20% of the originally calculated amounts and only for a grace period of two years through 2026. If the Bermuda Ministry of Finance amends The 2023 Act in response to this Guidance, the exact impact of any such amendments is uncertain but there is a risk that it results in a reduction in the Company's Deferred Tax Assets.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted. We have evaluated the tax provisions of the IRA, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax and the share repurchase excise tax, and do not expect the legislation to have a material impact on our results of operations.\nOur net income was $1.4 billion and $2.5 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectiv\nely. The decline was primarily driven by a decrease in underwriting income of $1.6 billion resulting from the unfavorable prior year development recognized in 2024, partially offset by an increase of $520 million in net investment income.\nOur combined ratio increased by 11.4 points to 102.3% in 2024, compared to 90.9% in 2023. The current year increase is primarily due to prior year development on attritional losses and higher current year catastrophe losses.\nThe loss ratio component increased by 11.7 points in 2024 over the same period last year mainly due to an increase of $423 million in catastrophe losses and prior year development on attritional losses.\nThe commission and brokerage ratio components decreased to 21.7% in 2024, compared to 22.0% in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to changes in the mix of business.\nThe other underwriting expense ratio decreased to 6.2% in 2024, compared to 6.3% in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to Reinsurance segment continued leverage against its premium base, offset by Insurance segment expenses driven by continued international growth.\nShareholders’ Equity.\nShareholders’ equity increased by $673 million to $13.9 billion at December 31, 2024 from $13.2 billion at December 31, 2023, principally as a result of $1.4 billion of net income, partially offset by $334 million of shareholder dividends, $200 million of share repurchases, $128 million of net foreign currency translation adjustments and $127 million of unrealized depreciation on fixed income available for sale securities, net of tax.\nConsolidated Investment Results\nNet Investment Income.\nNet investment income increased by 36.3% to $2.0 billion in 2024, compared with net investment income of $1.4 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily the result of an additional $382 million of income from fixed maturity and short-term investments, an increase of $84 million in income from limited partnerships and an increase of $45 million in income from other alternative investments. The limited partnership income primarily reflects changes in their reported net asset values. As such, until these asset values are monetized and the resultant income is distributed, they are subject to volatile results of future increases or decreases in the asset value.\nThe following table shows the components of net investment income for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\nShort-term investments and cash\nOther invested assets\nLimited partnerships\nGross investment income before adjustments\nFunds held interest income (expense)\nFuture policy benefit reserve income (expense)\nGross investment income\nNet investment income\n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\nThe following tables show a comparison of various investment yields for the periods indicated:\nAnnualized pre-tax yield on average cash and invested assets\nAnnualized after-tax yield on average cash and invested assets\nAnnualized return on invested assets\nFixed income portfolio total return\nBloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index\nCommon equity portfolio total return\nOther invested asset portfolio total return\nThe pre-tax equivalent total return for the bond portfolio was approximately 4.0% and 6.8%, respectively, in 2024 and 2023. The pre-tax equivalent return adjusts the yield on tax-exempt bonds to the fully taxable equivalent.\nThe Company’s cash and invested assets totaled $41.5 billion at December 31, 2024, which consisted of 86.5% fixed maturities, short term investments and cash and 13.5% of other invested assets and equity securities. Of the total fixed maturities, 96.4% were investment grade. Additionally, the average maturity of fixed maturity securities was 4.9 years at December 31, 2024, and their overall average duration was 3.1 years.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have any direct investments in commercial real estate, direct commercial mortgages or securities of issuers that are experiencing cash flow difficulty to an extent that the Company’s management believes that the issuer’s ability to meet debt service payments, except where an allowance for credit losses has been recognized, is threatened.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio includes structured commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) with a book value of $985 million and a fair value of $921 million. As of December 31, 2024, 85.2% of CMBS securities in our investment portfolio are rated AAA by nationally recognized rating agencies. The remainder of CMBS securities in our investment portfolio are rated investment grade by nationally recognized rating agencies.\nThe following table represents the credit quality distribution of the Company’s fixed maturities for the periods indicated:\n(Dollars in millions)\nRating Agency Credit Quality Distribution:\nAAA\nAA\nA\nBBB\nBB\nB\n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\nFixed maturities-available for sale are at fair value and fixed maturities-held to maturity are at amortized cost, net of allowances for credit losses.\nThe following table summarizes fixed maturities by contractual maturity for the periods indicated:\n(Dollars in millions)\nFixed maturity securities\nDue in one year or less\nDue after one year through five years\nDue after five years through ten years\nAsset-backed securities\nMortgage-backed securities\nTotal fixed maturity securities\n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\nFixed maturities-available for sale are at fair value and fixed maturities-held to maturity are at amortized cost, net of allowances for credit losses.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity securities are shown by contractual maturity. Mortgage-backed securities are generally more likely to be prepaid than other fixed maturity securities. As the stated maturity of such securities may not be indicative of actual maturities, the totals for mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are shown separately.\nNet Gains (Losses) on Investments.\nThe following table presents the composition of our net gains (losses) on investments for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\nRealized gains (losses) from dispositions:\nFixed maturity securities - available for sale\nOther Invested Assets\nShort Term Investments\nTotal net realized gains (losses) from dispositions\nAllowance for credit losses\nGains (losses) from fair value adjustments\nTotal net gains (losses) on investments\n(Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)\nTotal net ga",
