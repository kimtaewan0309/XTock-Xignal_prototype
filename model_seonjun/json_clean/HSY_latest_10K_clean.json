We also have pantry items, including baking products, toppings and sundae syrups sold under the\nHershey’s, Reese’s, Heath\nchocolate spreads and snack bites and mixes.\nWithin our North America Salty Snacks segment, we have our salty snack items. This includes ready-to-eat\npopcorn, baked and trans fat free\nDot’s Homestyle Pretzels\nWithin our International segment, we manufacture, market and sell many of these same brands, as well as other brands that are marketed regionally, such as\nconfectionery products in Mexico,\nIO-IO\nsnack products in Brazil and\nbeverage products in India.\nPrincipal Customers and Marketing Strategy\nOur customers are mainly wholesale distributors, chain grocery stores, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores, vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, dollar stores, concessionaires and department stores. The majority of our customers, with the exception of wholesale distributors, resell our products to end-consumers in retail outlets in North America and other locations worldwide.\nIn 2024, approximately 27% of our consolidated net sales were made to McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States (“U.S.”) to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\nThe foundation of our marketing strategy is our strong brand equities, product innovation and the consistently superior quality of our products. We devote considerable resources to the identification, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of new products. We utilize a variety of promotional programs directed towards our customers, as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers of our products, to stimulate sales of certain products at various times throughout the year.\nIn conjunction with our sales and marketing efforts, our efficient product distribution network helps us maintain sales growth and provide superior customer service by facilitating the shipment of our products from our manufacturing plants to strategically located distribution centers. We primarily use common carriers to deliver our products from these distribution points to our customers.\nRaw Materials and Pricing\nCocoa products, including cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and cocoa powder processed from cocoa beans, are the most significant raw materials we use to produce our chocolate products. These cocoa products are purchased directly from third-party suppliers, who source cocoa beans that are grown principally in Far Eastern, West African, Central and South American regions. West Africa accounts for approximately 70% of the world’s supply of cocoa beans.\nAdverse changes in climate or extreme weather, crop disease, political unrest and other problems in cocoa-producing countries have caused price fluctuations in the past, but have never resulted in the total loss of a particular producing country’s cocoa crop and/or exports. In the event that a significant disruption occurs in any given country, we believe cocoa from other producing countries and from current physical cocoa stocks in consuming countries would provide a significant supply buffer.\nOur trading company in Switzerland performs all aspects of cocoa procurement, including price risk management, physical supply procurement and sustainable sourcing oversight. The trading company optimizes the supply chain for our cocoa requirements, with a strategic focus on gaining real time access to cocoa market intelligence. It also provides us with the ability to recruit and retain world class commodities traders and procurement professionals and enables enhanced collaboration with commodities trade groups, the global cocoa community and sustainable sourcing resources.\nWe also use substantial quantities of sugar, corn products, Class II and IV dairy products, wheat products, peanuts, almonds and energy in our production process. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the United States. For our international operations, inputs not locally available may be imported from other countries.\nWe change prices and weights of our products when necessary to accommodate changes in input costs, the competitive environment and profit objectives, while at the same time maintaining consumer value. Price increases and weight changes help to offset increases in our input costs, including raw and packaging materials, fuel, utilities, transportation costs and employee benefits. When we implement price increases, there is usually a time lag between the effective date of the list price increases and the impact of the price increases on net sales, in part because we typically honor previous commitments to planned consumer and customer promotions and merchandising events subsequent to the effective date of the price increases. In addition, promotional allowances may be increased subsequent to the effective date, delaying or partially offsetting the impact of price increases on net sales.\nMany of our confectionery and salty snack brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace in North America and certain international markets. We sell our brands in highly competitive markets with many other global multinational, national, regional and local firms. Some of our competitors are large private companies, as well as large retailers, that have significant resources and substantial international operations. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, as well as convenience and service. We have also experienced increased competition from other snack items, and through innovation and acquisitions, we are continuing to expand the boundaries of our brands to capture new snacking occasions.\nWorking Capital, Seasonality and Backlog\nOur sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year, representing seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. We manufacture primarily for stock and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt. Therefore, the backlog of any unfilled orders is not material to our total annual sales. Additional information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital practices is provided in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\nTrademarks, Service Marks and License Agreements\nWe own various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. The trademarks covering our key product brands are of material importance to our business. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are renewable for fixed terms. We follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the United States and other key international markets where our products are sold. We also grant trademark licenses to third parties to produce and sell pantry items, flavored milks and various other products primarily under the\nFurthermore, we have rights under license agreements with several companies to manufacture and/or sell and distribute certain products. Our rights under these agreements are extendible on a long-term basis at our option. Our most significant licensing agreements are as follows:\nKraft Foods Ireland Intellectual Property Limited/Cadbury UK Limited\nPeter Paul Almond Joy\nMinimum sales requirement exceeded in 2024\nSociété des Produits Nestlé SA\nMinimum unit volume sales exceeded in 2024\nIconic IP Interests, LLC\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in a variety of research and development activities in a number of countries, including the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, India and Malaysia. We develop new products, improve the quality of existing products, improve and modernize production processes and develop and implement new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines. Information concerning our research and development expense is contained in\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFood Quality and Safety Regulation\nThe manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the U.S., our activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Similar agencies also regulate our businesses outside of the U.S.\nWe believe our Product Excellence Program provides us with an effective product quality and safety program. This program is integral to our global supply chain platform and is intended to ensure that all products we purchase, manufacture and distribute are safe, are of high quality and comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nThrough our Product Excellence Program, we evaluate our supply chain including ingredients, packaging, processes, products, distribution and the environment to determine where product quality and safety controls are necessary. We identify risks and establish controls intended to ensure product quality and safety. Various government agencies and third-party firms, as well as our quality assurance staff, conduct audits of all facilities that manufacture our products to assure effectiveness and compliance with our program and applicable laws and regulations.\nEnvironmental Considerations\nBeyond ordinary operating and capital expenditures that we make to comply with government regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, Hershey has made several voluntary commitments to drive long-term growth and business resilience and reduce our environmental impacts, including efforts to eliminate commodity-driven deforestation and reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions across our own operations and supply chain. Our climate change related investments and expenditures primarily focus on our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, Forest Land and Agriculture (“FLAG”) emissions and non-FLAG emissions consistent with global environmental standards. The annual operating and capital expenditures associated with ordinary course payments and additional climate change commitments are not material with respect to our results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position.\nThe Company’s commitment to sustainability started with our founder’s belief in responsible citizenship. He was a purpose-driven leader who believed we could use chocolate to Make More Moments of Goodness in the world for our consumers today and for many generations to come. This belief resulted in a strong investment in local communities and the establishment of Milton Hershey School for disadvantaged kids. We continue that legacy today through our global sustainability strategy: Our Shared Goodness Promise, which guides how we empower the remarkable people who make and sell our brands, interact with farming communities that grow our ingredients, deliver on our commitments to consumers, customers, and external stakeholders, protect the environment and support children and youth.\nTo learn more about our Sustainability-related goals, progress and initiatives, as well as review our annual ESG Report and accompanying suite of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) reporting frameworks, policies, and disclosures, access the Sustainability section of our website at:\nhttps://www.thehersheycompany.com/en_us/sustainability.html\nFinancial Information by Geographic Area\nOur principal operations and markets are located in the United States.

  "item7_clean": "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe MD&A is organized in the following sections:\nBusiness Model and Growth Strategy\nTrends Affecting Our Business\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nBUSINESS MODEL AND GROWTH STRATEGY\nWe are the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America, a leading snack maker in the United States and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. We report our operations through three segments: (i) North America Confectionery, (ii) North America Salty Snacks and (iii) International, as discussed in\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur vision is to be a leading snacking powerhouse. We aspire to be a leader in meeting consumers’ evolving snacking needs while strengthening the capabilities that drive our growth. We are focused on four strategic imperatives to ensure the Company’s success now and in the future:\nDrive Core Confection Business and Broaden Participation in Snacking\n. We continue to be the undisputed leader in U.S. confection by taking actions to deepen our consumer connections and utilize our beloved brands to deliver meaningful innovation, while also diversifying our portfolio to capture profitable and incremental growth across the broader snacking continuum.\nOur products frequently play an important role in special moments among family and friends. Seasons are an important part of our business model and for consumers, as they are highly anticipated, cherished times, centered around traditions. For us, it’s an opportunity for our brands to be part of many connections during the year when family and friends gather.\nInnovation is an important lever in this variety-seeking category and we are leveraging work from our proprietary demand landscape analytical tool to shape our future innovation and make it more impactful. We are becoming more disciplined in our focus on platform innovation, which should enable sustainable growth over time and significant extensions to our core.\nTo expand our breadth in snacking and become a leading snacking powerhouse, we are focused on continuing to expand the boundaries of our core confection brands to capture new snacking occasions and increasing our exposure into new snack categories through acquisitions.\nDeliver Profitable International Growth\n. We are focused on ensuring that we efficiently allocate our resources to the areas with the highest potential for profitable growth. We have reset our international investment strategy, while holding fast to our belief that our targeted emerging market strategy will deliver long-term, profitable growth. The uncertain macroeconomic environment in many of these markets is expected to continue and we aim to ensure our investments in these international markets are appropriate relative to the size of the opportunity.\nExpand Competitive Advantage through Differentiated Capabilities\n. In order to generate actionable insights, we must acquire, integrate, access and utilize vast sources of the right data in an effective manner. We are working to leverage our advanced data and analytical techniques to gain a deep understanding of our consumers, our customers, our shoppers, our end-to-end supply chain, our retail environment and key economic drivers at both a macro and precision level, including digital transformation and new media models. In addition, we are in the process of transforming our supply chain capabilities and enterprise resource planning system, which will enable employees to work more efficiently and effectively.\nResponsibly Manage Our Operations to Ensure the Long-Term Sustainability of Our Business, Our Planet and Our People\n. We are a purpose-driven company and for more than a century, our iconic brands have been built on a foundation of community investment and connections between people around the world. We could not have achieved this without our remarkable employees who make our purpose a reality. We believe our long-standing values make our Company a special place to work.\nWe believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We utilize continuous listening surveys that are distributed throughout the year to all employees globally to hear their thoughts on the Company’s direction and their place in it. These continuous touchpoints allow for real-time feedback and action from the Company. These surveys are further supplemented with quarterly and informative enterprise summits and team “Ask Me Anything” meetings, which, in conjunction with the continuous listening surveys, generate stronger employee engagement with the Company’s strategy, initiatives and leadership.\nOur diverse and inclusive culture makes the difference across all areas of the business. Our gender representation includes women occupying many of the top positions in the Company, including Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Chief Accounting Officer and President, Salty Snacks, and approximately 50% representation across the Company. Additionally, four of our 10 Board members are women (40% representation). In 2024, we maintained fair and equitable pay achievements, including aggregate salary U.S. gender pay equity and aggregate U.S. salary people of color pay equity.\nWe continue to make progress on our ESG priorities and continue to elevate these ESG initiatives for a greater global impact. Through our focus on sustainability and social impact across our value chain, we continue to improve and focus on the lives of cocoa farmers and cocoa communities, the environmental priorities of climate change and the role of packaging in our business, responsibly and sustainably sourcing the inputs to our products and increasing investments in human rights and diversity initiatives and growing diverse representation across the organization.\nOVERVIEW\nHershey is a global confectionery leader known for making more moments of goodness through chocolate, sweets, mints and other great tasting snacks.

Sour Strips is\nan emerging sour candy brand and is available in a wide range of food distribution channels in the United States.\nOn May 31, 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain assets that provide additional manufacturing capacity from Weaver Popcorn Manufacturing, Inc. (“Weaver”), a leader in the production and co-packing of microwave popcorn and ready-to-eat popcorn, and former co-manufacturer of the Company’s\nTRENDS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS\nThroughout 2024, U.S. consumer behavior continued to shift and evolve, as cost fatigue and labor markets restrict income growth and constrain consumer spending and purchasing patterns. As a result, consumer behavior related to our products has shifted. As such, for the year ended December 31, 2024,we continued to experience a dynamic macroeconomic environment, including price volatility related to select commodities, resulting in corresponding incremental costs and gross margin pressures, and net sales and net income declines. Despite specific actions taken to mitigate these gross margin pressures, we continue to experience overall declines in consumer demands for our products, and higher prices for direct materials used to manufacture our products were, and continue to be, the primary incremental cost to our business (see\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nincluded in this MD&A). We utilize many exchange traded commodities for our business that are subject to price volatility, specifically cocoa products, which experienced a market price increase of approximately 70% throughout 2024 (see",
