In response to this weakness in our Design IP segment, we will be taking actions to sharpen our execution and reallocate resources to the highest growth opportunities.\nThe following table sets forth some of our key quarterly unaudited financial information:\nThree Months Ended July 31,\nNine Months Ended July 31,\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet income from continuing operations attributed to Synopsys\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations attributed to Synopsys\nDiluted net income (loss) per share attributed to Synopsys:\nContinuing operations\nDiscontinued operations\n*The operating results of Ansys, which have been included in our financial results for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2025 for the period from July 17, 2025 through July 31, 2025, were not material to our overall results.\nFinancial performance summary for the\n\nor 7%, primarily due to revenue growth across a majority of products and geographies,\nimpact of the extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 of approximately $63.2 million, and weakness in our Design IP segment due to several headwinds,\nChina export control restrictions, such as the Q3 2025 BIS Restrictions,\nweaker than expected demand from a major foundry customer, and certain roadmap and resource decisions that did not yield their intended results.\nTotal cost of revenue and operating expenses was $4.0 billion, an increase of $559.2 million or 16% primarily due to increases of $330.2 million in employee-related costs resulting from headcount increases through organic growth, $121.3 million in legal, consulting and other professional fees mainly in connection with the Ansys Merger, and $63.7 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired from the Ansys Merger.\nSynopsys delivers industry-leading silicon design, IP, simulation and analysis (S&A) solutions as well as design services. We partner closely with our customers across a wide range of industries to maximize their R&D capability and productivity, powering innovation today that ignites the ingenuity of tomorrow. For more information about our business segments and product groups, see Part I, Item 1,\nin our Annual Report.\nWe have consistently grown our revenue since 2005, despite periods of global economic uncertainty. We achieved these results because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, and because we generally recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period, which typically approximates three years. See Note 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin our Annual Report for a discussion on our revenue recognition policy\nThe revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. As a result, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenue in a significant way.\nOur growth strategy is focused on expanding our total addressable market by maximizing the capabilities of R&D teams across industries spanning semiconductor, high-tech, industrial, aerospace, and more with engineering solutions from silicon to systems. Our priorities are to maintain and expand our technology leadership, drive sustainable growth and efficiently scale to accelerate our strategy. Our revenue growth from period to period is expected to vary based on the mix of our time-based and upfront products. Our upfront products have grown at a faster rate than our time-based products in recent periods, which has resulted in, and may in the future result in, increased fluctuation in our business, operating results and overall financial position on a quarterly basis. Such fluctuation may be more pronounced depending on demand from our larger customers. See Part II, Item 1A,\nOur operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price\"\nof this Quarterly Report for further discussion on potential fluctuations in our operating results. Based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.\nAcquisition of Ansys\nOn July 17, 2025 (the Acquisition Date), we completed our acquisition of ANSYS, Inc. (Ansys) pursuant to the terms of the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 15, 2024 (the Merger Agreement) by and among Synopsys, Ansys and ALTA Acquisition Corp. (Merger Sub), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Synopsys (the Ansys Merger).\nAcquisition of Ansys\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor more information on the Ansys Merger.\nFor more on risks related to the Ansys Merger, see Part II, Item 1A,\nRisks Related to the Ansys Merger\n\" of this Quarterly Report.\nImpact of the Current Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Environment\nUncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including the effects of, among other things, changes in U.S. and global trade policy, including the recently proposed and enacted tariffs by the U.S. and other governments, sustained global inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates, potential economic slowdowns or recessions, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical pressures, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and associated global economic conditions, have resulted in increased volatility in global markets. While we have seen continued strength in the artificial intelligence and high-performance computing sectors, certain industries such as industrial, automotive and consumer electronics have recovered more slowly from recent macroeconomic uncertainty. The current uncertain macroeconomic environment has led some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, delay their drawdowns under non-cancellable commitments, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us.\nWe expect growth across our geographies in fiscal 2025 with the exception of China, where we are continuing to experience a challenging economic environment due to the collective impact of macroeconomic factors and Trade Restrictions (as defined below). See the discussion below under the heading \"Developments in Export Control Regulations\" and in Part II, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors, \"We are subject to governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our products and services, which could impair our ability to compete in international markets\"\nof this Quarterly Report for further discussion of the impact of Trade Restrictions, including export control regulations, on Synopsys.\nWe are also actively monitoring the recent changes in U.S. and global trade policy, such as the recently proposed and enacted tariffs by the U.S. government. Certain countries have responded to the U.S. tariffs by imposing or threatening retaliatory tariffs. There may be additional changes to tariff levels and other aspects of global trade policy in fiscal 2025 in the U.S. and other countries due to global trade negotiations and other factors. While we are actively monitoring these changes in global trade policy and the effects they may have on our business and broader macroeconomic environment, they have not had a material impact on our business, operating results or financial condition to date.\nWe are also monitoring other geopolitical pressures around the world, including, among others, changes in China-Taiwan and U.S.-China relations, the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and other regional or global military conflicts. Any significant disruption caused by these or other geopolitical pressures or conflicts could materially affect our employees, business, operating results, financial condition or customers in those regions of the world. For example, Synopsys has employees, operations, customers and strategic partners in the Middle East. While we are actively monitoring the conflicts in the Middle East, at this time they have not had a material impact on our business, operating results or financial condition to date.\nWhile our time-based model provides stability to our business, operating results and overall financial position, the broader implications of these macroeconomic or geopolitical events, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. Further, the negative impact of these events or disruptions may be deferred due to our business model. See Part II, Item 1A,\nUncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition\nOur operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price\"\nof this Quarterly Report for further discussion of the impact of global economic and geopolitical uncertainty on our business, operations and financial condition and potential fluctuations in our operating results, respectively.\nDevelopments in Export Control Regulations\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS) has continued to publish changes to U.S. export control regulations (the U.S. Export Regulations), including, amo"
