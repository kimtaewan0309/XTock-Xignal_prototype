  "item1_clean": "Seasonal Fluctuations\nGeneral economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and we have historically experienced seasonal trends within our two operating segments, customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve. Sales of the Invisalign System are often weaker in Europe, especially southern European countries during the summer months and seasonally higher in China during the third quarter. Similarly, other international holidays like Lunar New Year can impact our sales in APAC in the first quarter. In North America, summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents start their children in treatment before the school year begins. Conversely, many GPs are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases. For our Systems and Services segment, capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. However, many of these typical seasonal patterns have been impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates, military conflicts, inflation and other macroeconomic challenges. It remains unclear when or if these seasonal fluctuations will return to historical norms. Consequently, seasonal trends have and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nCompetition in the clear aligner market continues to increase. Our clear aligner products compete directly against traditional orthodontic treatments that use metal brackets and wires and increasingly against clear aligner products manufactured and distributed by various companies, both within and outside the United States. Although the number of competitors varies by segment, product, geography and customer, they include new and well-established regional competitors in certain foreign markets, as well as larger companies, divisions of larger companies or well-capitalized new entrants with substantial sales, marketing, research and financial capabilities. We also compete with direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) companies that provide clear aligners directly to the consumer requiring little or no in-office care from doctors and also from doctors themselves who can manufacture retainers and custom clear aligners using 3D printing technology. In addition, corresponding foreign patents began expiring in 2018 which has increased competition outside the United States.\nWe believe we are well positioned to compete in the markets we target. We have thousands of dedicated, highly skilled sales force employees who are focused on key demographics in our target markets that allow us to uniquely address customer needs and thereby enhance the customer experience. Our significant historical and ongoing investments in research and development and design around the movement of teeth, SmartTrack aligner materials and design, intraoral scanning, 3D manufacturing, global scale of manufacturing and treatment planning, strong brand name recognition, strong workforce, diversified and knowledgeable customer base, geographic expansion, reliable financial results, leading digital platform, technology and IP, next wave of innovation with direct 3D printing and innovations powered by AI enabling more personalized care, and regulatory clearance of our products are among a few of our key competitive factors that compare favorably with our competitors’ products and services.\nGovernment Regulations\nMany countries throughout the world have established regulatory frameworks for commercialization of medical devices. As a designer, manufacturer, and marketer of medical devices, we are obligated to comply with the respective frameworks of these countries to obtain and maintain access to these global markets.\nThe frameworks often define requirements for marketing authorizations which vary by country. Failure to obtain appropriate marketing authorization and to meet all local requirements, including specific quality and safety standards and new software and AI standards in any country in which we currently market our products, could cause commercial disruption and/or subject us to sanctions and fines. Delays in receipt of, or a failure to receive, such marketing authorizations, or the loss of any previously received authorizations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWith regards to premarket authorization in the United States, many of our products are classified as medical devices under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”). The FD&C Act requires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with medical device regulations defined by the FDA. The regulatory framework depends on a set of written processes for ensuring consistent quality called a Quality Management System (“QMS”) coupled with a product marketing authorization which depends on the risk classification of the product. This regulatory framework is comparable to the framework established in the European Union (“EU”). Within the EU, our products are subject to the requirements defined by the Medical Device Regulation EU 2017/745 which replaced the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC with a final transition date of May 26, 2021. Similar market access regulations exist in Brazil, China, Japan and other countries. Our QMS is routinely audited by certification bodies as well as country regulators for compliance with applicable regulations. We believe we are in material compliance with all state, federal, and international regulatory requirements applicable to our products.\nWe are also subject to various laws around the world that govern interactions with our customers as healthcare professionals or government officials. The laws govern different interactions and may include: prohibiting improper influence of or payments to healthcare professionals, other decision makers or purchasers of medical devices and government officials; setting out rules for when and how to engage healthcare professionals; marketing our products within the regulatory approval (e.g., on label) promotion, sale and marketing of our products and services; the importing and exporting of our products; the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products; and disclosure of payments to healthcare professionals and institutions. As we expand our operations footprint, countries to which we sell and invest in new business models, compliance with applicable laws becomes more complex and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement.\nInitiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies, and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business. It is not possible to predict at this time whether these trends will impact our business or the potential cost containment measures on our future business.\nOur customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by state or federal funded programs such as Medicaid, a foreign national healthcare program, or private pay insurance, each of which may offer some degree of oversight. As a medical device manufacturer and seller, we are subject to transparency reporting laws (also known as sunshine laws) that in certain countries and U.S. states require us to report transfers of value to healthcare professionals that perform services or receive other items from us (e.g., meals, travel, branded promotional or educational items, or other benefits of value). Enforcement actions and associated efforts to respond or defend against enforcement actions can be expensive, and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nIn addition, we must comply with numerous laws and regulations addressing privacy, data protection, data governance and cyber security. Many of these laws and regulations do or will soon regulate or restrict cross-border data transfers, such as in the United States, the EU, Switzerland, Brazil, China, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and other countries. Further, in the United States, we may be required to comply with laws and regulations addressing the collection, use, security and processing of protected health information and other information relating to individuals, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its implementing rules. The HIPAA Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (“Privacy Standards”) and the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information under HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH Act”) (the “Security Standards”) are the subjects of final and proposed rule amendments, respectively, reflecting the rapidly evolving nature of these laws and regulations. Additionally, many U.S. states maintain laws and regulations addressing privacy, data protection, data governance and cybersecurity. Like many other companies, we must work to ensure our global privacy program framework incorporates applicable requirements of new and modified laws and regulations in relevant jurisdictions to support our efforts to ensure that our product innovations and our associated practices comply with these increasingly complex laws and regulations.\nLegislatures and regulators globally are proposing, and in certain cases have enacted, new laws or regulations regarding privacy, data protection, data governance and cybersecurity that could require us to modify our policies and practices in order to comply with new and evolving obligations relating to these matters. Information regarding risks associated with data security and privacy may be found in Part I, Item 1A\n\nAlign Technology, Inc.

  "item7_clean": "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\"\nand on our investor relations website at\ninvestor.aligntech.com\nExecutive Overview of Results\nTrends and Uncertainties\nOur strategic priorities focus on four principal pillars for growth: (i) international expansion; (ii) general dental practitioners (“GP”) treatment; (iii) patient demand; and (iv) orthodontic utilization. Our growth strategy depends on our ability to facilitate the digital transformation of dentistry happening around the world, our continuous focus on innovation, and expansion to meet and exceed evolving customer expectations as the array of products and services available to them increases.\nWe strive to deliver on each of our strategic growth drivers through a variety of interrelated enterprise-wide efforts including:\nContinuing penetration and adoption of Invisalign clear aligners, intraoral scanners and CAD/CAM solutions in international markets by investing in manufacturing operations, research and development, clinical treatment planning, sales and marketing and building our quality and regulatory capabilities in existing and emerging markets globally. For instance, we have fabrication facilities in three key regions as a part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to customers to serve them more quickly and respond to their needs more effectively as well as new treatment planning operations in targeted regional geographies. We have also diversified our research and development activities, which has created a longer term, more stable environment for consistent hiring, retention and innovation in a variety of high technology locations.\nTargeting growth opportunities with international orthodontists and GP customers, particularly with adopters of digital dentistry platforms by tailoring our sales and marketing strategies, manufacturing operations and resources around the unique needs of each customer channel. As we continue growing, we intend to opportunistically expand our research, development, manufacturing, treatment planning, and sales and marketing operations to meet local and regional demand thoughtfully and deliberately. Over the longer-term, we expect international revenues to grow faster than Americas' revenues as a result of growing international demand, our continued investment in international market expansion, the size of the market opportunities and our relatively low market penetration in these regions.\nBuilding confidence within the GP and orthodontic communities through training and education efforts to increase their adoption and utilization of digital dental practice transformation and clear aligner treatment. We continue to expand our clear aligner customer base by educating new doctors on the benefits of digital dentistry through the Invisalign System. We furthermore demonstrate to GPs and orthodontists how the iTero portfolio of intraoral scanners, products like Invisalign Go™ treatment, and CAD/CAM restorative services and workflows can increase revenues and profitability for their dental practices by enhancing patient experiences and creating operational practice efficiencies. DSOs represent a large and growing opportunity to help drive adoption of digital technology across the dental industry. We have well established relationships with many DSOs globally that recognize the benefits of digital workflows enabled by our portfolio of products and services that make up the Align\nTM\nDigital Platform, including increased practice efficiency and profitability, as well as delivering a better patient experience from shorter cycle times and customer proximity. We have and may continue to financially invest in or explore collaborations with key ecosystem partners, including DSOs, whose missions and visions align with our own vision, strategy, business model and goals.\nInvesting in research and development that allows us to innovate, develop and bring to market products and solutions that deliver the ever-increasing clinical precision and predictability that doctors expect with the speed and convenience their patients require.\nCreating demand and enabling patient conversion with targeted investments in advertising and public relations through social media, influencers and other forms of digital communications to encourage treatment by Invisalign trained doctors. We believe that well-designed, targeted sales and marketing promotions that build on our strong brand awareness allow us to differentiate our products and solutions from traditional and emerging competitors. To increase awareness and educate young adults, parents and teens about the benefits of Invisalign treatment, in 2024, we continued to invest in and create campaigns across markets in media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, SnapChat, WeChat, and Douyin. We expect to make further investments to create additional demand for Invisalign System treatment driving more consumers to dental professionals for those treatments.\nPursuing new product lines that complement our doctor-prescribed principal products currently available in certain e-commerce and retail channels in the United States. Similarly, in 2024, we continued our focus on our doctor subscription plan and grew our underpenetrated share of the retainer business through strategic marketing campaigns focused on driving adoption and increasing market share.\nIncreasing global orthodontic utilization rates as doctors’ clinical confidence in the efficacy and predictability of the Invisalign System increases with advancements in products and technology and as patients and doctors demand treatments that emphasize convenience and safety through fewer visits and less invasive and quicker treatments. In addition, the teenage and younger market makes up about 70% of the approximately 22 million total annual global orthodontic case starts. We continue to emphasize the benefits of the Invisalign System for teenage and younger patient treatments through education, training and sales and marketing programs. In 2024, we had record shipments to teenage and younger patients. We expect utilization rates to continue to rise. However, our utilization rates will fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, which may include seasonal trends in our business, consumer demand due to macroeconomic factors, and adoption rates for new products and features.\nBelow is a discussion of the significant trends and uncertainties that could impact our operations:\nMacroeconomic Challenges and Military Conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East\nOur revenues are susceptible to fluctuations resulting from events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, higher interest rates, actual and threatened wars and military actions, threats or actual imposition of tariffs, customs duties and fees by nations and retaliatory actions, threats of or actual slowdowns or recessions, supply chain challenges, market volatility, employment levels, wages, debt obligations, discretionary income and other factors, each of which impacts customer confidence, consumer sentiment and demand. Many of these same factors also impact our costs and those of our suppliers through higher raw material prices, transportation costs, labor costs, supply and distribution operations. During 2024, we believe sales of our products were adversely impacted by macroeconomic conditions that negatively affected disposable income and consumer demand. We believe this trend will continue in 2025. We also expect the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine to continue to create market uncertainties and dampen consumer sentiment and demand, particularly in Europe.\nAdditionally, government actions in various countries relating to implemented or proposed tariffs, particularly the United States, China, Mexico, and Europe are expected to adversely impact our revenue and cost of goods sold if implemented. The degree of our exposure is dependent on, among other things, the type of goods subject to any tariffs enacted, the tariff rates imposed, the timing of the tariffs and any retaliatory measures enacted. The impact of declining demand may vary by time and region, making operational results uncertain and difficult to predict. We continue to closely monitor the foregoing issues, assess their potential impact on our operations and financial results, and implement plans to mitigate the impact of any adverse events.\nAdditionally, a material amount of our revenues are derived internationally and many of our international operations are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2024, the U.S. dollar remained strong against major currencies, which negatively impacted our financial condition and results of operations for the year. Foreign exchange volatility and the subsequent strengthening or weakening of the U.S dollar against other currencies remains uncertain and unpredictable.\nWe continue to monitor the potential for violence and military actions that may directly or indirectly impact our personnel, manufacturing, supply chain, and sales. For instance, ongoing conflicts in the Middle East may further exacerbate general and regional macroeconomic instability, particularly if fighting intensifies, spreads to other locations, creates shipping and logistical challenges or cost increases, leads to sanctions or boycotts, or otherwise may materially impact our operations. For instance, our iTero business is headquartered in Israel and, although the sales, delivery times and cost of shipping our\nproducts have not been materially impacted and we have put measures in place to help reduce the future risks, it remains uncertain if there will be impacts on our sales, delivery times or cost of shipping our products. While there have been export and import restrictions imposed against products originating from and businesses operating in Israel, they have not materially impacted our sales or operations to date although we continue to monitor the risk.\nChanging Product Preferences\nAs the markets for clear aligners and digital processes and workflows used to transform the practice of dentistry continue to mature, we continue to anticipate customer and patient expectations and demands will continue to evolve. We expect to meet customer demands with innovative treatment options that include more choices to address a wider scope of treatment goals and budgets based on our existing and new products. This may result in larger and unpredictable variations in geographic and product mix and selling prices with uncertain implications on our financial statements and business operations.\nWe strive to manage the challenges from the trends and uncertainties, including the macroeconomic conditions, tariffs and retaliatory measures, military conflicts and the evolution of our target markets, by focusing on improving our operations, further increasing flexibility and efficiencies in our processes, adjusting our business models to changing circumstances and offering products that meet market demand. Specifically, we are managing financial impacts through strategic product innovations, introductions and pricing actions, implementing cost saving measures and evaluating hiring needs.\nAs an example, there was significant adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive 3in3 product after it was introduced in 2023 that continued in 2024. The 3in3 configuration offers doctors Invisalign Comprehensive treatment with a three-year treatment expiration date and three additional clear aligners included prior to the treatment expiration date. The 3in3 product also allows us to recognize more revenue up front while doing so at a lower price as compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product that has a five-year treatment expiration date with unlimited additional clear aligners prior to the treatment end date.\nKey Financial and Operating Metrics\nWe measure our performance against these strategic priorities by the achievement of key financial and operating metrics. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our business operations reflect the following:\nRevenues of $3,999.0 million, an increase of 3.5% year-over-year;\nClear Aligner revenues of $3,230.1 million, an increase of 1.0% year-over-year;\nAmericas Clear Aligner case revenues of $1,426.3 million, a decrease of 2.5% year-over-year;\nInternational Clear Aligner case revenues\n\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNet outflow of $80 million from deferred revenues; and\nNet outflow of $153 million from accounts receivable due to timing of collections and increased revenues.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cash flows from operations of $786 million resulted primarily from our net income of approximately $445 million as well as the following:\nSignificant adjustments to net income\nStock-based compensation of $154 million related to equity awards granted to employees and directors; and\nDepreciation and amortization of $142 million related to our investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\nSignificant changes in working capital\nNet inflow of $46 million from accrued and other long-term liabilities primarily due to higher incentive accruals for 2023, as well as timing of payments of other activities;\nNet inflow of $87 million from deferred revenues due to the deferral of revenue on shipments;\nNet inflow of $30 million from inventories primarily due to lower purchases of materials used in manufacturing; and\nNet outflow of $105 million, net from accounts receivable due to timing of collections and increased revenues.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $255 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 which primarily consisted of $116 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, $77 million for the Cubicure acquisition and $106 million for investments in privately held companies, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $44 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $196 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 which primarily consisted of purchases of property, plant and equipment of $178 million which included a building acquisition for $25 million, an investment in equity of a privately held company of $77 million and purchases of marketable securities of $3 million, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $61 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $356 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 which consisted of payments to repurchase shares of our common stock of $353 million and payroll taxes paid for equity awards through share withholdings of $28 million, which were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock for $25 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $598 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 which consisted of payments to repurchase shares of our common stock of $602 million and payroll taxes paid for equity awards through share withholdings of $23 million, which were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock for $27 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis and use authoritative pronouncements, historical exper",
