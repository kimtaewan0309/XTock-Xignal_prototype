  "item1_clean": "Net sales by major product categories for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nOur buying team continuously reviews and updates our product assortment as necessary to respond to customer needs and to offer new, relevant products. We are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance needs with emphasis on consumable, usable, and edible (“C.U.E.”) products. Examples of C.U.E. product categories include, but are not limited to, livestock feed and bedding, pet food, bird seed, lubricants, propane, and various seasonal products, such as fertilizer, weed control, mulch, pest control, and twine.\nOur products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors, each of whom are expected to adhere to a code of conduct that guides our relationship. Our business is not dependent upon any single vendor or particular group of vendors. We purchase our products from a group of over 1,000 vendors, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2024. Approximately 400 core vendors accounted for 90% of our merchandise purchases during fiscal 2024. We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products to meet customer demands despite the global supply chain disruptions and delays. We believe that adequate sources of supply exist, but they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs.\nOur buying teams focus on merchandise procurement, vendor line reviews, and testing of new products and programs. We also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on forecasting and inventory replenishment, a committed merchandise planning team that concentrates on assortment planning, and a specialized pricing team that seeks to optimize market-specific pricing for our products. Through the combined efforts of these teams, we continue to focus on improving our overall inventory productivity and in-stock inventory position.\nIntellectual Property\nOur subsidiary, Tractor Supply Co. of Texas, LP (“TSCT”), owns registrations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for various service marks including\nTSC\nTSC Tractor Supply Co.\nPetsense by Tractor Supply\n®, and the trapezium design for retail services. We consider these service marks, and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition, to be valuable assets of our business. TSCT also owns several other service marks for retail services, some of which have been registered with the USPTO and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO.\nIn addition to selling products that bear nationally-known manufacturer brands, we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business. These exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands, which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination retailer.\nOur exclusive brands represented approximately 29%, 29%, and 30% of our total sales in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Our exclusive brands include:\n\n(poultry feed, poultry kits and egg\nThe exclusive brands identified above have been registered as trademarks with the USPTO for certain products and some are the subject of additional applications for registration pending before the USPTO for other products.\nOur trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates; however, provided that we continue to use the marks and file appropriate maintenance and renewal documentation with the USPTO in a timely manner, the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration. Our patents (both United States and foreign) have expiration dates ranging from April 5, 2027 to November 3, 2043 and protect various elements, designs or functions of farm and ranch equipment, as well as light systems for trucks and other vehicles.\nWe believe our intellectual property, which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above, together with certain trade names, domain names, patents, and copyrights, has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies.\nWe currently operate a distribution facility network for supplying stores with merchandise and delivering product ordered through our websites and mobile application. In fiscal 2024, our Tractor Supply stores received approximately 81% of merchandise through this network while the remaining merchandise shipped directly from our vendors to our stores or customers. We believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise that allows us to be a dependable supplier to our customers for their “\n” lifestyle solutions by enhancing in-stock inventory positions, while minimizing freight expense and improving the inventory turn rate. Our distribution facilities, located in Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New York, Ohio and Texas represent a total distribution center capacity of approximately 7.8 million square feet. We also use third-party operated import centers, mixing centers and pop-up distribution facilities which provide additional distribution capacity. On May 14, 2024, the Company opened its tenth and largest distribution center located in Maumelle, Arkansas, which expanded the distribution center capacity by approximately 1.2 million square feet.\nWe select the locations of our distribution facilities in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution facilities to our stores. Our distribution centers utilize warehouse and labor management tools that support the planning, control, and processing of inventory. We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a transportation management system. We utilize multiple common carriers for store and direct to customer\ndeliveries. We manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, monitoring of transportation routes, and scheduling of deliveries.\nLeveraging our value-driving offerings from our Neighbor’s Club loyalty program, we utilize an “everyday low price” philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by limited and strategically planned promotions throughout the year. To drive store traffic, build brand consideration, and position ourselves as a destination retailer, we promote a broad selection of merchandise and our “Life Out Here” brand messaging through digital and social media initiatives, targeted digital video (connected TV and streaming programming), and e-mail. In addition, our\nloyalty program continues to drive strong customer count growth and enhances our ability to engage with our customers, recognize and reward our best customers, drive desired purchase behaviors, and create brand advocacy. Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions, additional funding, and honoring coupons. Our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design, support for in-store events, point-of-purchase materials for customer education, and product knowledge for our team members.\nEnsuring that our customers can engage with us in the most convenient manner for them whether in our stores, on our website, on our mobile application, or via our Customer Solutions Center, is a high priority for us. Our goal is to be available anytime, anywhere, and in any way our customers choose to engage with our brand. We provide our customers the opportunity to shop in a manner that fits their lifestyle and is most convenient for them.\nOur focus is on delivering a comprehensive, easy shopping experience, offering the conveniences our customers want and expect by driving a personalized experience by leveraging our Neighbor’s Club Loyalty program.\nWe offer buy online, pickup in-store, and curbside pickup, which provide convenient access for customers to pick up merchandise from our store locations. Additionally, our online experience offers an expansive product assortment including a direct to consumer assortment. This allows us to extend our aisles beyond our store locations and provides convenient and useful content that is relevant to our customers’ lifestyle. We provide our customers the ability to have products shipped directly to our retail store locations or delivered to their homes or offices. For select products, we offer same day delivery. We use our distribution facility network as well as our stores to support our e-commerce activities. Our digital commerce (“Digital”) capabilities have further enhanced our in-store shopping experience, allowing us to engage with our customers more effectively, and expanded our target markets outside of our current retail store locations.\nContinuous Improvement\nWe are committed to a continuous improvement program to drive change throughout our organization. Using data analytics and team member engagement, we examine business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs, drive innovation, and improve effectiveness. We establish annual goals for productivity and cost improvement. Additionally, we have\ntraining goals to expand our team’s knowledge and understanding of continuous improvement, which is a key pillar in our culture\n. We have implemented several continuous improvement projects, with team members across our business, to evaluate key operations and implement process changes. Team members are empowered and expected to challenge current paradigms and improve processes. Management encourages the participation of all team members in the decision-making process, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members, and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities.\nManagement Information and Control Systems\nWe have invested resources in management information and control systems to provide legendary customer service and to deliver the right products in the right place at the right time. This investment includes use of digital technologies that support the “\n” lifestyle and integrate the customer experience in-store, online, and through our Customer Solutions Center, which offers customers the ability to shop anytime, anywhere, and in any way they choose. Our key platforms include:\nPoint-of-sale system;\nE-commerce platform;\nConsumer mobile app;\nReplenishment and allocation systems;\nMerchandising presentation and inventory management tools;\nWarehouse and transportation management systems;\nLabor management tools for stores and supply chain;\nPrice optimization system;\nVendor purchase order control system;\nHuman resource information systems;\nBusiness intelligence and analytics tools; and\nCustomer loyalty and campaign management system.\nThese systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.\nWe continue to invest in technology to support store, online, and distribution facility expansion and our long-term strategic growth initiatives focused heavily on improving the customer experience across all channels. We also continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness. Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations, refreshes, and upgrades to support optimal software configurations, and application performance. We plan to continue to invest in information technology and implement efficiency-driving system enhancements\nsuch as computer vision, labor and task management tools, edge computing and artificial intelligence.\nWe will continue to evaluate the use of emerging technologies to improve productivity\nsuch as robotics, robotic process automation, quantum comput",
  "item7_clean": "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFounded in 1938, Tractor Supply Company (the “Company” or “Tractor Supply” or “we” or “our” or “us”) is the largest rural lifestyle retailer in the United States (“U.S.”). The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers, ranchers, and all those who enjoy living the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the “\n” lifestyle). As of December 28, 2024, we operated 2,502 retail stores in 49 states under the names\nTractor Supply Company\nPetsense by Tractor Supply.\nOur stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities. We also operate websites under the names\n, as well as a Tractor Supply Company mobile application. Through our stores and e-commerce channels, we offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:\nLivestock, Equine & Agriculture: livestock and equine feed & equipment, poultry, fencing, and sprayers & chemicals;\nCompanion Animal: food, treats and equipment for dogs, cats, and other small animals as well as dog wellness;\nSeasonal & Recreation: tractor & rider, lawn & garden, bird feeding, power equipment, and other recreational products;\nTruck, Tool, & Hardware: truck accessories, trailers, generators, lubricants, batteries, and hardware and tools; and\nClothing, Gift, & Décor: clothing, footwear, toys, snacks, and decorative merchandise.\nTractor Supply Company believes we can grow our business by being a more integral part of our customers’ lives as the dependable supplier of “\n” lifestyle solutions, creating customer loyalty through personalized experiences, and providing convenience that our customers expect anytime, anywhere, and in any way they choose. Our long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand and deepen our customer base by providing personal, localized, and memorable customer engagements by leveraging content, social media, and digital shopping experiences, attracting new customers and driving loyalty, (2) evolve customer experiences by digitizing our business processes and furthering our digital capabilities, (3) offer relevant assortments and services across all channels through exclusive and national brands and continue to grow our total addressable market by introducing new products and services through our test and learn strategy, (4) drive operational excellence and productivity through continuous improvement, increasing space utilization, and implementing advanced supply chain capabilities to support growth, scale and agility, and (5) expand through selective acquisitions, as such opportunities arise, to add complementary businesses and to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to supplement organic growth.\nAchieving this strategy will require a foundational focus on: (1) connecting, empowering and growing our team to enhance their lives and the communities we call home, enabling them to provide legendary service to our customers, and (2) allocating resources in a disciplined and efficient manner to drive profitable growth and build stockholder value, including leveraging technology and automation, to align our cost structure to support new business capabilities for margin improvement and cost reductions.\nOver the past five years, we have experienced considerable growth in stores, growing from 2,024 stores (1,844 Tractor Supply retail stores and 180 Petsense by Tractor Supply retail stores) at the end of fiscal 2019 to 2,502 stores (2,296 Tractor Supply retail stores and 206 Petsense by Tractor Supply retail stores) at the end of fiscal 2024, and in net sales, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.2%. Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets. We have developed a proven method for selecting store\nsites, and we believe we have significant additional opportunities for new Tractor Supply stores. We also believe that there is opportunity for continued growth for Petsense by Tractor Supply stores.\nIn fiscal 2024, we opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores in 34 states and 11 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in seven states. In fiscal 2023, we opened 70 new Tractor Supply stores in 28 states and 13 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in nine states. This resulted in a selling square footage increase of approximately 2% in fiscal 2024 and 3% in fiscal 2023.\nNet sales increased 2.2% to $14.88 billion in fiscal 2024 from $14.56 billion in fiscal 2023. Comparable store sales increased 0.2% in fiscal 2024 compared to a flat growth rate in fiscal 2023. Gross profit increased 3.2% to $5.40 billion in fiscal 2024 from $5.23 billion in fiscal 2023, and gross margin increased 34 basis points to 36.3% of net sales in fiscal 2024 from 35.9% of net sales in fiscal 2023. Operating income decreased 30 basis points to 9.9% of net sales in fiscal 2024 from 10.2% of net sales in fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2024, net income was $1.10 billion, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared to $1.11 billion, or $2.02 per diluted share, in fiscal 2023.\nWe ended fiscal 2024 with $251.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and outstanding long-term debt of $1.83 billion, after returning $1.03 billion to our stockholders through stock repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.\nComparable Store Metrics\nComparable store metrics are a key performance indicator used in the retail industry and by the Company to measure the performance of the underlying business. Our comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales and exclude certain adjustments to net sales. Stores closed during either of the years being compared are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations. Stores relocated during either of the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics calculations. If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics calculations became material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations. An Orscheln store will be considered a comparable store one year after its point-of-sale system conversion. Comparable store sales are intended only as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nTransaction Count and Transaction Value\nTransaction count and transaction value metrics are used by the Company to measure sales performance. Transaction count represents the number of customer transactions during a given period. Transaction value represents the average amount paid per transaction and is calculated as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions during a given period.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies and estimates, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.\nMerchandise Inventory:\nWe identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory, and other benchmarks. We have established an inventory valuation reserve to recognize the estimated impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies.\nWe also have established a reserve for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts. The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods’ sales volumes. Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences. Our general policy is to perform physical inventories at least once a year for each store that has been open more than twelve months.\nWe do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term. However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves. Our impairment reserves contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment. The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience. We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends. Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends, the effect of loss prevention measures and merchandising strategies.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves or shrinkage in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment or shrinkage. However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand, clearance potential or inventory loss for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our inventory impairment reserve as of December 28, 2024, would have affected net income by approximately $2.5 million in fiscal 2024. A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve as of December 28, 2024, would have affected net income by approximately $4.7 million in fiscal 2024.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves:\nWe self-insure a significant portion of our workers’ compensation insurance and general liability (including product liability) insurance plans. We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values. Provisions for losses related to our self-insured liabilities are based upon periodic independent actuarially determined estimates that consider a number of factors including historical claims experience, loss development factors, and severity factors.\nThe full extent of certain workers’ compensation and general liability claims may not become fully determined for several years. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date based upon historical data and experience, including actuarial calculations.\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves. However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves as of December 28, 2024, would have affected net income by approximately $11.4 million in fiscal 2024.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets:\nLong-lived assets, including lease right-of-use assets, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations, and other costs to operate a store. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the related\nasset or asset group to its estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model, market valuation, or other valuation technique, as appropriate. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.\nOur impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values.\nWe have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented.\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.\nThere were no significant long-lived assets impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2024.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets:\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In accordance with the accounting standards, an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test, and if impaired, the associated assets must be written down to fair value.\nThe quantitative impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company’s operations, for the amount in which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit",
