  "item1_clean": "Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either milling or heap leaching, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder and mixed with water into a slurry, which then passes through a carbon-in-leach circuit to recover the gold. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable, synthetically lined pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold contained within the ore. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation.\nGold contained in ores that are not naturally-oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is liberated and amenable to cyanidation, generally known as free milling ores. Ores that are not amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher grade refractory ores are processed through either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.\nSome gold sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave, roaster, or fine grinding circuit to recover the gold through leaching. Gold-bearing solution is then plated onto cathodes in an electrowinning process or precipitated using zinc powder. In both cases, the precipitate is melted with fluxes in a furnace to produce doré\nOre containing zinc, silver, lead, and gold is delivered to a crushing and grinding plant which feeds a sulfide processing plant. The sulfide processing plant primarily comprises lead and zinc flotation stages. In the lead and zinc flotation, the slurry is conditioned with reagents to activate the desired minerals and produce lead and zinc concentrate. The lead concentrate is highly enriched in gold and silver, with a smaller fraction of the precious metal recovered in the zinc concentrate. The resulting concentrate is sold to smelters or traders for further processing.\nOre containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by successive stages of flotation resulting in a gold/copper concentrate containing approximately 10% to 26% copper and is dewatered and transported off-site. The flotation tailings have a residual gold content that is recovered in a carbon-in-leach circuit.\nA summary of product and form by segment is set forth below.\nGold, Silver, Lead, Zinc\nCerro Negro, Argentina\nBoddington, Australia\nLihir, Papua New Guinea\nNGM, U.S.\nCC&V, U.S.\n____________________________\nProducts listed are only for gold and co-product metals. See above for further information on co-product classification.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company abandoned the pyrite leach plant at Peñasquito resulting in no production of doré for the year ended 2024. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nRefer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on held for sale.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company completed the sale of the assets of the Telfer reportable segment. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThe top 10 producers of gold comprise approximately twenty-five percent of total worldwide mined gold production. We currently rank as the top gold producer with approximately five percent of estimated total worldwide mined gold production. Our competitive position is based on the size and grade of our ore bodies anchored in a large portfolio of Tier 1 assets located in favorable mining jurisdictions. A Tier 1 asset is defined as having, on average over such asset’s mine life: (1) production of over 500,000 GEOs per year on a consolidated basis, (2) average AISC per oz in the lower half of the industry cost curve, (3) an expected mine life of over 10 years, and (4) operations in countries that are classified in the A and B rating ranges for Moody’s, S&P and Fitch.\nWe have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures. Our costs are driven by the location, grade and nature of our ore bodies, and the level of input costs, including energy, labor and equipment. The metals markets are cyclical, and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits, hire and retain a skilled workforce, and to manage our costs.\nLicenses and Concessions\nOther than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities, there are no third-party patents, operating licenses or franchises material to our business. In many countries, however, we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to land-related licenses which include leases, concessions, claims, or prospecting licenses granted by the host government. These countries include, among others, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Suriname, Chile, Argentina, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Ecuador, Fiji, and Ghana. Refer to Item 2, Properties, below for further information on land-related licenses and concessions by property. The concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks associated with the host country. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, below for further information.\nCondition of Physical Assets and Insurance\nOur business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. Refer to Results of Consolidated Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources within Part II, Item 7, MD&A, for further information.\nWe maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, below for further information.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nFocusing on environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") practices are an important part of Newmont’s business. Widely recognized for our principled ESG practices, we have been consistently ranked as a leader in the mining and metal sector S&P Global, and we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index since 2007.\nESG is a key part of how we make investment decisions and central to our culture and purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. Sustainability and safety are integrated into the business at all levels of the organization through our global policies, standards, strategies, business plans, and remuneration plans. Our global strategies, notably those related to Sustainability and Health, Safety, and Security, direct all levels of our business in environmental stewardship, strong workforce safety and health practices, social responsibility and good governance. With clear targets, open communication and transparent reporting, we strive for continuous improvement to meet the evolving expectations of investors, governments, communities and other key stakeholders, and to contribute to a sustainable future for all.\nStakeholder Engagement.\nWe engage regularly with relevant stakeholders, who we consider to be any person or organization potentially impacted by our activities or influential to our success, which allows us to gain a greater understanding of their needs, interests and perspectives while, at the same time, encouraging shared decision making to promote mutually beneficial outcomes. These engagements also inform what information is most useful for stakeholders for the purposes of our non-financial reporting. Newmont also engages with and commits to meeting the expectations of a variety of organizations at a global, regional, national and local level - and where applicable - adhering to these organizations' high standards of governance, social and environmental policies and performance. These memberships and other external commitments reflect our values, support our approach to working collaboratively on best practices across several key matters and allow external stakeholders to hold us accountable. Our participation in industry initiatives, wherein we often take a leadership role, allows us to inform and influence global standards and practices, as well as gain insight into emerging expectations and issues.\nWe believe that transparency and accountability are key attributes of governance. Since 2003, Newmont has been reporting on how we manage the sustainability issues of relevance to stakeholders around the globe. Our sustainability report provides an annual review of non-financial performance on governance, strategy and management approach, risk management, and performance and targets in key areas that include health, safety and security, workforce, the environment, supply chain, social responsibility, business integrity and compliance, value sharing, and equity, inclusion and diversity domains. Our sustainability report is compiled in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (\"GRI\") 2021 Universal Standards Core option, the GRI Mining and Metals Sector Supplement, and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\"SASB\") Metals & Mining standards. Data is subject to an external limited assurance review and reflects Newmont’s commitment to transparency and reporting obligations as a founding member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (\"ICMM\") and as an early adopter of the United Nations (\"UN\") Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. Additionally, our sustainability report aligns with the requirements the ICMM's Mining Principles' Performance Expectations and Position Statements, the GISTM and the World Gold Council's Responsible Gold Mining Principles.\nNewmont’s sustainability reporting suite also includes our sustainability-linked bond framework, ESG data tables, conflict-free gold report, modern slavery statement, policy influence disclosures, political spending disclosures, taxes and royalties contributions report, CDP (formerly, “Carbon Disclosure Project”) responses, and other reports and responses, which can be found on our website at www.newmont.com/sustainability.\nThe information on our website, including, without limitation, in the annual sustainability report and climate report, should not be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report or otherwise “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.\nEnvironmental Practices\nWe accept the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (\"IPCC\") assessment of climate science, and we acknowledge that human activities contribute to climate change and business has an important role in addressing this global challenge. It is our firm belief that climate change is one of the greatest global challenges o",
  "item7_clean": "at sites held prior to the Newcrest transaction by $12, primarily in Mexico, during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company held AUD- and CAD-denominated fixed forward contracts to mitigate variability in the USD functional cash flows related to the AUD- and CAD-denominated operating expenditures to be incurred between October 2024 and December 2025 at certain sites, respectively. The unrealized changes in fair value for the fixed forward contracts are recorded in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nand will be reclassified to earnings through\nCosts applicable to sales\nbeginning October 2024. Refer to Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our hedging instruments.\nHyperinflationary Economies\nHyperinflationary economies are defined by the International Monetary Fund as economies in which the projected three-year cumulative inflation exceeds 100%. For the year ended December 31, 2024, hyperinflationary economies in which the Company held operations included Ghana, Argentina, and Suriname.\nOur Ahafo and Akyem mines are located in Ghana and are USD functional currency entities. In 2021, the Bank of Ghana created a gold purchase program in the effort to stabilize the local currency and build up gold reserves through domestic gold purchases conducted in local currency at prevailing market rates. As the gold purchase program was voluntary, there was no significant impact to Ahafo. The majority of Ahafo’s activity has historically been denominated in USD; as a result, the devaluation of the Ghanaian cedi has resulted in an immaterial impact on our financial statements. Therefore, future devaluation of the Ghanaian cedi is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOur Cerro Negro mine is located in Argentina and is a USD functional currency entity. Beginning in 2020, Argentina’s central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency, including requiring the Company to convert USD proceeds from metal sales to local currency within 60 days from shipment date or 20 business days from receipt of cash, whichever happens first, as well as restricting payments to foreign-related entities denominated in foreign currency, such as dividends or distributions to the parent and related companies and royalties and other payments to foreign beneficiaries. These restrictions directly impact Cerro Negro's ability to repay intercompany debt to the Company. In the third quarter of 2024, certain restrictions were lifted or modified, allowing companies to repay intercompany debt in certain circumstances. We continue to monitor the foreign currency exposure risk and the evolution of limitations of repatriating cash to the U.S. Currently, these currency controls are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOur Merian mine is located in Suriname and is a USD functional currency entity. In 2021, the Central Bank took steps to stabilize the local currency, while the government introduced new legislation to narrow the gap between government revenues\nand spending. The measures to increase government revenue mainly consist of tax increases; however, Newmont and the Republic of Suriname have a Mineral Agreement in place that supersedes such measures. The Central Bank of Suriname adopted a controlled floating rate system, which resulted in a concurrent devaluation of the Surinamese dollar. The majority of Merian’s activity has historically been denominated in USD; as a result, the devaluation of the Surinamese dollar has resulted in an immaterial impact on our financial statements. Therefore, future devaluation of the Surinamese dollar is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have a disciplined capital allocation strategy of maintaining financial flexibility to execute our capital priorities and generate long-term value for our stockholders. Consistent with that strategy, we aim to self-fund development projects and make strategic partnerships focused on profitable growth, while reducing our debt and returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nThe Company continues to experience the impacts from geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures. With the resulting volatile environment, we continue to monitor inflationary conditions, the effects of certain countermeasures taken by central banks, and the potential for further supply chain disruptions, as well as an uncertain and evolving labor market. Depending on the duration and extent of the impact of these events, or changes in commodity prices, the prices for gold and other metals, and foreign exchange rates, we could continue to experience volatility; transportation industry disruptions could continue, including limitations on shipping produced metals; our supply chain could continue to experience disruption; cost inflation rates could further increase; or we could incur credit related losses of certain financial assets, which could materially impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we believe our available liquidity allows us to manage the short- and, possibly, long-term material adverse impacts of these events on our business. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on risks and uncertainties.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had $3,664 in\nCash and cash equivalents\n, of which $3,619 was included in\nCash and cash equivalents\nand $45 was included in\nAssets held for sale\nrelated to certain non-core assets that were classified as held for sale in the first quarter of 2024\nThe majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in a variety of highly liquid and low-risk investments with original maturities of three months or less that are available to fund our operations as necessary. We may have investments in prime money market funds that are classified as cash and cash equivalents; however, we continually monitor the need for reclassification under the SEC requirements for money market funds, and the potential that the shares of such funds could have a net asset value of less than their par value. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund our operations and corporate activities.\nAt December 31, 2024, $1,970 of\nCash and cash equivalents\nwas held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily held in USD denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to USD. Cash and cash equivalents denominated in Argentine peso are subject to regulatory restrictions. Refer to Foreign Currency Exchange Rates above for further information. At December 31, 2024, $1,655 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. We expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with any potential withholding taxes.\nWe believe our existing consolidated\nCash and cash equivalents\n, available capacity on our revolving credit facility, and cash generated from continuing operations will be adequate to satisfy working capital needs, fund future growth, meet debt obligations and meet other liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2024, our borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility was $4,000 and we had no borrowings outstanding. We continue to remain compliant with covenants and do not currently anticipate any events or circumstances that would impact our ability to access funds available on this facility. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our\nOur financial position was as follows:\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents included in assets held for sale\nAvailable borrowing capacity on revolving credit facilities\n____________________________\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, certain non-core assets were determined to meet the criteria for assets held for sale. As a result, the related\nCash and cash equivalents\nAssets held for sale\n. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn connection with the Newcrest transaction, the Company acquired bilateral bank facilities that were repaid in full in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, the revolving credit facility was amended in February 2024 to increase the available borrowing capacity to $4,000. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nNet debt is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management to evaluate financial flexibility and strength of the Company's balance sheet. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities of continuing operations\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations\nwas $6,318 in 2024, an increase in cash provided of $3,564 from the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the impact of sites acquired in the Newcrest transaction, which contributed $1,562 of cash provided by operating activities. Excluding the impact of the sites acquired in the Newcrest transaction, the increase in cash provided was primarily due to an increase in\nresulting from the reduction of sales in 2023 as a result of the Peñasquito labor strike and higher average realized gold prices in 2024. These inflows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of sales and shipments, and a payment of $291 made in the first quarter for stamp duty tax related to the Newcrest transaction. Refer to Consolidated Financial Results, above, for more information on our\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities of continuing operations\nwas $(2,855) in 2024, an increase in cash used of $1,853 from the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower net maturities of time deposits, higher capital expenditures in 2024, and cash acquired as a result of the Newcrest transaction in 2023, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the assets of Telfer in the fourth quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Telfer sale.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\nwas $(2,953) in 2024, an increase in cash used of $1,350 from the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to partial redemptions of certain senior notes and repurchases of common stock, partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of debt and lower dividend payments in 2024. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our\nIn February 2025, the Board declared a dividend of $0.25 per share. The declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the full discretion of the Board and will depend on the Company’s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\nIn February 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of outstanding common stock to provide returns to stockholders, provided that the aggregate value of shares of common stock repurchased under the new program does not exceed $1 billion. The program will expire after 24 months (in February 2026). In October 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $2 billion stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of outstanding common stock. The program will expire after 24 months (in October 2026). The programs will be executed at the Company’s discretion, utilizing open market repurchases to occur from time to time throughout the authorization period. The repurchase programs may be discontinued at any time, and the programs do not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares of its common stock or to repurchase the full authorized amount during the authorization period. Consequently, the Board of Directors may revise or terminate such share repurchase authorization in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we executed and settled trades totaling $1,246 of common stock repurchases under the previously authorized program.\nCapital Expenditures\nCash generated from operations is used to execute our capital priorities, which include sustaining and developing our global portfolio of long-lived assets. Our near-term development capital projects include Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, and Cadia Panel Caves.\nThese projects are being funded from existing liquidity and will continue to be funded from future operating cash flows. Capital costs are estimated to be between $1,700 and $1,800 for Tanami Expansion 2 with an expected commercial production date in the second half of 2027. Capital costs are estimated to be between $950 and $1,050 for Ahafo North with an expected commercial production date in late 2025. Capital costs are estimated to be between $1,000 and $1,200 for the PC2-3 Cadia Panel Caves project with development capital costs expected to continue until the second half of 2026.\nWe consider sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. Capital expenditures to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations, where these projects will enhance production or reserves, are considered non-sustaining or development capital. The Company’s decision to\nreprioritize, sell or abandon a development project, which may include returning mining concessions to host governments, could result in a future impairment charge.\nThe Company continues to evaluate strategic priorities and deployment of capital to projects in the pipeline to ensure we execute on our capital priorities and provide long-term value to stockholders. Included in the Company's continuous evaluation is consideration of current market opportunities or pressures. In response, the Company has chosen to continue deferring the investment decision for the Yanacocha Sulfides project. With the delay of the Yanacocha Sulfides project, management will focus its efforts on optimizing its allocation of funds to current operations and other capital commitments, while also assessing execution options and project plans options, up to and including transitioning Yanacocha operations into full closure. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Additionally, the Company has decided to reprioritize capital at Cerro Negro, shifting focus from ongoing underground mine life extension initiatives to surface infrastructure projects at Cerro Negro and other opportunities within its portfolio.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 we had\nAdditions to property, plant and mine development\nDevelopment Projects\nDevelopment Projects\nDevelopment Projects\nNGM\nCC&V\nDecrease (increase) in non-cash adjustments\n____________________________\nSites acquired through the Newcrest transaction.
