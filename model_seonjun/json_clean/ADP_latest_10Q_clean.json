ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $278 million in July 2025, to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for fiscal 2026 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2025 reinsurance policy.\nThe primary components of “Other” are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, severance costs, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and all other interest income and expense.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods:\nAdjusted Financial Measure\nAdjusted provision for income taxes\nProvision for income taxes\nAdjusted net earnings\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\nDiluted earnings per share\nAdjusted effective tax rate\nOrganic constant currency\nWe believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior periods, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance. The nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations. Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.\nProvision for income taxes\nAll other interest expense (a)\nAll other interest income (a)\nLegal settlements (b)\nAdjusted EBIT Margin\nProvision for income taxes\nLegal settlements (c)\nAdjusted provision for income taxes\nAdjusted effective tax rate (d)\nLegal settlements (b)\nIncome tax provision for legal settlements (c)\nAdjusted net earnings\nLegal settlements (b) (c)\nAdjusted diluted EPS\nNote: Numbers may not foot due to rounding.\n(a) In adjusted EBIT, we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as “All other interest expense” and “All other interest income.”\n(b) In the three months ended September 30, 2024, this represents a reserve reversal of a legal reserve recorded during the year ended June 30, 2023.\n(c) The income tax provision was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our adjusted provision for income taxes divided by the sum of our adjusted net earnings plus our adjusted provision for income taxes.\nThe following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-GAAP measure of organic constant currency, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one-year period preceding the transaction. The impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year results using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. The PEO segment is not impacted by acquisitions, dispositions or foreign currency.\nConsolidated revenue growth as reported\nImpact of acquisitions\nImpact of foreign currency\nConsolidated revenue growth, organic constant currency\nEmployer Services revenue growth as reported\nImpact of acquisitions\nImpact of foreign currency\nEmployer Services revenue growth, organic constant currency\nNote: Numbers may not foot due to rounding.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCE\nS\nAs of September 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $2.5 billion, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.\nFor corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flow from operations together with our\nof committed credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.\nOur financial condition remains solid at September 30, 2025 and we have sufficient liquidity.\nFor client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements\n($7.5 billion of which is available on a committed basis in the U.S. as of June 30, 2025), together with our $10.6 billion\nitted credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Please see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a further discussion of the risks related to our client funds extended investment strategy. See Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.\nOperating, Investing and Financing Cash Flows\nOur cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, are summarized as follows:\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\nInvesting activities\nFinancing activities\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to a net unfavorable change in the components of operating assets and liabilities partially offset by growth in our business, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities changed due to timing of net proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $203.7 million.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities changed due to a net increase in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $11,443.6 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and debt.\nWe purchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $302.10 during the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to purchases of 1.4 million shares at an average price per share of $259.47 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.\nCapital Resources and Client Funds Obligations\nWe have $4.0 billion\nof senior unsecured no\ntes with maturity dates in 2028, 2030, 2032, and 2034. We may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nSee Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our senior unsecured notes.\nOur U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $10.6 billion in aggregate maturity value. Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s, Prime-1 (“P-1”) by Moody’s and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days.\n\nAs of September 30, 2025 and June 30, 2025 the Company had $5.2 billion and $4.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which were repaid in early October 2025 and July 2025, respectively. Details\nof the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as foll"
