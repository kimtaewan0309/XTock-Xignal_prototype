Its operations are located in the United States.\nWilliams’ interstate natural gas pipeline strategy is to create value by maximizing the utilization of its pipeline capacity by providing high-quality, low-cost transportation of natural gas to large and growing markets. Williams’ gas pipeline businesses’ interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. As such, Williams’ rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion, or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things, are subject to regulation. The rates are established primarily through the FERC’s ratemaking process, but Williams may also negotiate rates with its customers pursuant to the terms of its tariffs and FERC policy. Changes in commodity prices and volumes transported have limited near-term impact on these revenues because the majority of the cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates.\nThe ongoing strategy of Williams’ midstream operations is to safely and reliably operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where its assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. Williams focuses on consistently attracting new business by providing highly reliable service to its customers. These services include natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression and storage; NGL fractionation, transportation and storage; and crude oil production handling and transportation, as well as marketing services for NGL, crude oil, and natural gas.\nConsistent with the manner in which Williams’ CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources, Williams’ operations are conducted, managed, and presented within the following reportable segments: Transmission, Power & Gulf, Northeast G&P, West, and Gas & NGL Marketing Services. All remaining business activities, including upstream operations, certain new energy ventures, and corporate activities, are included in Other. Williams’ reportable segments are comprised of the following business activities:\nTransmission, Power & Gulf is comprised of interstate natural gas pipelines and their related natural gas storage facilities including Transco, NWP, and MountainWest\nequity-method investment in Gulfstream;\nnatural gas gathering and processing and crude oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast region, includ\na former 60 percent equity-method investment in which Williams acquired the remaining ownership interest in August 2024 (see Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures) and\na 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One; and natural gas storage facilities and pipelines providing services in north Texas, and also in Louisiana and\nMississippi related to the January 2024 Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition (see Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures). Transmission, Power & Gulf also includes power innovation projects under development that will deliver speed-to-market solutions in grid-constrained markets. This segment was formerly referred to as Transmission & Gulf of America.\nNortheast G&P is comprised of midstream gathering, processing, and fractionation businesses in the Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania and New York, and the Utica Shale region of eastern\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\nOhio, as well as a 65 percent interest in Northeast JV which operates in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, a 66 percent interest in Cardinal which operates in Ohio, a 50 percent equity-method investment in Blue Racer, and Appalachia Midstream Investments.\nWest is comprised of gas gathering, processing, and treating operations in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and Wyoming, the Barnett Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of east Texas and northwest Louisiana, the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko and Permian basins, and the DJ Basin of Colorado. This segment also includes NGL storage facilities, an undivided 50 percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, and a 50 percent equity-method investment in OPPL.\nGas & NGL Marketing Services is comprised of NGL and natural gas marketing and trading operations, which include risk management and transactions related to the storage and transportation of natural gas and NGLs on strategically positioned assets.\nIn September 2025, Williams paid a regular quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share.\nOverview of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025\nNet income (loss) attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nThe project on NWP’s existing natural gas transmission system provides year-round transportation capacity from the Stanfield receipt point in Oregon to multiple delivery points in Idaho and a new delivery meter in Wyoming. NWP placed the project into service in November 2025, increasing NWP’s contracted capacity by 80 Mdth/d.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\nCommonwealth Energy Connector\nIn November 2023, Transco received approval from the FERC for the project, which involves an expansion of Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity in Virginia. Transco placed the project into service in November 2025, increasing Transco’s capacity by 105 Mdth/d.\nAlabama Georgia Connector\nIn March 2024, Transco received approval from the FERC for the project, which involves an expansion of Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from Transco’s Station 85 pooling point in Alabama to customers in Georgia. Transco placed the project into service in October 2025, increasing Transco’s capacity by 64 Mdth/d.\nDeepwater Shenandoah Project\nIn June 2021, Williams reached an agreement with two third parties to provide offshore natural gas gathering and transportation services as well as onshore natural gas processing services. The project expands the existing Gulf of America offshore infrastructure connecting to a third-party offshore lateral pipeline from the Shenandoah platform to Discovery’s existing Keathley Canyon Connector pipeline, adds onshore processing facilities at Larose, Louisiana to handle the expected rich Shenandoah production, and the natural gas liquids are now fractionated and marketed at Discovery’s Paradis plant in Louisiana. This project was placed into service in July 2025.\nTexas to Louisiana Energy Pathway\nIn January 2024, Transco received approval from the FERC for the project, which involves an expansion of Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system to provide firm transportation capacity from receipt points in south Texas to delivery points in Texas and Louisiana.
