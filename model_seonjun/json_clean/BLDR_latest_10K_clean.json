  "item7_clean": "Homebuilding Industry and Market Competition.\nOur business is driven primarily by the residential new construction market and the residential repair and remodel market, which are in turn dependent upon a number of factors, including demographic trends, interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, housing affordability, household formation, land development costs, the availability of skilled construction labor, rising inflationary pressures, mortgage markets and the health of the economy. Many factors have impacted and may continue to impact our sales and gross margins, including continued consolidation within the building products supply industry, increased competition for homebuilder business, supply chain constraints and cyclical fluctuations in commodity prices. Moreover, our industry remains highly fragmented and competitive, and we will continue to face significant competition from local and regional suppliers. As various current market dynamics, including inflationary pressures, mortgage rates and housing affordability shift, industry forecasters, including the National Association of Home Builders (“NAHB”), expect to see housing demand increase in the near-term. Despite recent tempered market conditions, we believe the housing industry remains underbuilt and that there are several meaningful trends that indicate U.S. housing demand will continue to be strong over the long-term, including the aging of housing stock and normal population growth due to immigration and birthrate exceeding death rate.\n\nRepair and remodel end market\n. While influenced by housing starts to a lesser degree than the homebuilding market, the repair and remodel market is still dependent upon some of the same factors, including demographic trends, interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, the health of the economy and home financing markets. As a result of these pressures, we may experience reduced sales demand, challenges in the supply chain, increased margin pressures and/or increased operating costs in this area of our business. We expect that our ability to remain competitive in this space will depend on our continued ability to provide a high level of customer service coupled with a broad product offering.\n\nCost and/or Availability of Materials.\nPrices of building materials, including wood products, are subject to cyclical market fluctuations, which may adversely impact operating income when prices rapidly rise or fall within a relatively short period of time. We purchase materials which are then sold to customers as well as used as direct production inputs for our manufactured and prefabricated products. Short-term changes in the cost and/or availability of these materials, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are often passed on to our customers, but our pricing quotation periods and market competition may limit our ability to pass on such price changes. We may also be limited in our ability to pass on increases on in-bound freight costs on our products. We may also experience challenges sourcing suitable products for our customers and may be forced to provide alternative materials as substitution for contracted orders. Our inability to pass on material price increases to our customers could adversely impact our operating results.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $48.2 million, or 1.3%. This decrease in expenses was primarily due to decreased variable compensation costs related to decreased sales and profitability, and reduced intangible amortization expense, partially offset by additional operating expenses from locations acquired within the last twelve months and asset write-offs.\n\nWe may experience changes in interest expense if changes in our debt occur. Changes in market interest rates could also affect our interest expense. Our 5.00% unsecured senior notes due 2030 (“5.00% 2030 notes”), 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2032 (“4.25% 2032 notes,”), 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2032 (“6.375% 2032 notes”), and 6.375% 2034 notes bear interest at a fixed rate, and therefore our interest expense related to these notes would not be affected by an increase in market interest rates. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest at either a base rate or secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), plus, in each case, an applicable margin. Therefore, we are exposed to interest rate risk under the Revolving Facility. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2024. The Revolving Facility also assesses variable commitment and outstanding letter of credit fees based on quarterly average loan utilization.\n\nAs a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 23.1% from 22.4% in 2023. This increase was primarily due to decreased cost leverage on lower net sales during the period.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, actual U.S. total housing starts for the year ended December 31, 2024, were 1.4 million, a decrease of 3.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Actual U.S. single-family housing starts for the year ended December 31, 2024, were 1.0 million, an increase of 6.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. A composite of third-party sources, including the NAHB, are forecasting 1.4 million U.S. total housing starts and 1.0 million U.S. single-family housing starts for 2025, which are relatively flat from 2024. In addition, in its September 2024 semi-annual forecast, the HIRI forecasted sales in the professional repair and remodel end market to increase 3.2% in 2025 compared to 2024.\n\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, were $16.4 billion, a 4.1% decrease from net sales of $17.1 billion for 2023. Net sales decreased primarily as a result of a core organic sales decrease of 5.1% due to a continued normalization in the multi-family customer segment and declines in the single-family customer segment as home size and complexity decrease, while commodity price deflation decreased net sales by another 1.8%. These decreases were partially offset by increases in net sales from acquisitions and increased selling days of 2.1% and 0.7%, respectively.\n\nWe purchase certain materials, including lumber products, which are then sold to customers as well as used as direct production inputs for our manufactured products that we deliver. Short-term changes in the cost of these materials and the related in-bound freight costs, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are sometimes, but not always, passed on to our customers. Delays in our ability to pass on material price increases to our customers can adversely impact our operating results.\n\nControlling Expenses.\nAnother important aspect of our strategy is controlling costs and striving to be a low total-cost building materials supplier in the markets we serve. We closely manage our working capital and operating expenses, and we pay careful attention to our logistics function and its effect on our shipping and handling costs. However, we do have significant fixed costs and declines in our customer demand could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\n\nEconomic Conditions.\nEconomic changes both nationally and locally in our markets impact our financial performance. The building products supply industry is highly dependent upon new home construction and, to a lesser extent, repair and remodel activities, and is subject to cyclical market changes. Our operations are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, national and local economic conditions, labor costs and availability, competition, government regulation, trade policies (including with respect to tariffs on imported goods), inflation and other factors that affect the homebuilding industry, such as demographic trends, interest rates, housing starts, the high cost of land development, employment levels, consumer confidence, and the availability of credit to homebuilders, contractors, and homeowners. Disruptions and uncertainties as a result of a number of unforeseen environmental, social, economic or other factors, may have a significant impact on our future operating results.\n\nWe believe the long-term outlook for the housing industry is positive and that the housing industry remains underbuilt due to growth in the underlying demographics compared to historical new construction levels. However, uncertainty around interest rates and inflation may continue to pressure near-term housing industry demand as homes are less affordable for consumers, investors and builders. We believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of the construction activity in our markets and to increase our market share, which may include strategic acquisitions. We will continue to focus on working capital by closely monitoring the credit exposure of our customers, remaining focused on maintaining the right level of inventory and by working with our vendors to improve payment terms. We strive to achieve the appropriate balance of short-term expense control while maintaining the expertise and capacity to grow the business as market conditions expand.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying amounts. Factors that could negatively impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and potentially trigger impairment include, but are not limited to, unexpected competition, lower than expected housing starts, an increase in market participant weighted average cost of capital, increases in material or labor cost, and/or significant declines in our market capitalization. Future impairment of goodwill would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period but would not impact our current outstanding debt obligations or compliance with covenants contained in the related debt agreements. We did not have any goodwill impairments in 2024, 2023 or 2022.\n\nGross margin decreased $0.6 billion to $5.4 billion due to decreased sales. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 32.8% in 2024 from 35.2% in 2023, a 2.4% decrease.\n\nThe following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain costs, expenses and income items for the years ended December 31:\n\nSpecialty Building Products and Services.\nSpecialty building products and services consist of various products, including vinyl, composite and wood siding, exterior trim, metal studs, cement, roofing, insulation, wallboard, ceilings, cabinets, and hardware. This category also includes services such as turn-key framing, shell construction, design assistance and professional installation of products spanning all of our product categories. We also offer software products through our Paradigm subsidiary, including drafting, estimating, quoting, and virtual home design services, which provide digital solutions to retailers, distributors, manufacturers and homebuilders that help them boost sales, reduce costs, and become more competitive.\n\nThis decrease was attributable to single-family and multi-family margin normalization.\n\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nTargeting Large Production Homebuilders.\nThe homebuilding industry continues to undergo consolidation, and the larger homebuilders continue to increase their market share. We expect that trend to continue as larger homebuilders have better liquidity and land positions relative to the smaller, less capitalized homebuilders. Our focus is on maintaining relationships and market share with these customers while balancing the competitive pressures we face in servicing large homebuilders with certain profitability expectations. Additionally, we continue to focus on expanding our custom homebuilder base while maintaining acceptable credit standards.\n\nUse of Prefabricated Components.\nHomebuilders are increasingly using prefabricated components in order to realize increased efficiency, overcome skilled construction labor shortages and improve quality. Shortening cycle times from start to completion is a key imperative of the homebuilders during periods of strong consumer demand. As the availability of skilled construction labor remains limited, we continue to see the demand for prefabricated components increasing within the residential new construction market.\n\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company completed a private offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior unsecured notes due 2034 (“6.375% 2034 notes”) at an issue price equal to 100% of par value. The net proceeds from the offering were used to pay related transaction fees and expenses, repay indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Facility and for general corporate purposes.\n\nWe offer an integrated solution to our customers by providing manufacturing, supply, and installation of a full range of structural and related building products. Our manufactured products include our factory-built roof and floor trusses, wall panels, vinyl windows, custom millwork and trim, as well as engineered wood that we design, cut, and assemble for each home. We also assemble interior and exterior doors into pre-hung units. Additionally, we supply our customers with a broad offering of professional grade building products not manufactured by us, such as dimensional lumber and lumber sheet goods, various window, door and millwork lines along with other various building products. Our full range of construction-related services includes professional installation, turn-key framing and shell construction, and spans all of our product categories. We also offer digital solutions through our Paradigm subsidiary, including drafting, estimating, quoting, and virtual home design services.\n\nSignificant information and assumptions utilized in estimating future cash flows for quantitative goodwill impairment analyses include projections of revenue growth utilizing publicly available industry information such as lumber commodity prices and housing start forecasts developed by industry forecasters, including the NAHB. Expected future profitability reflects current headcount levels and cost structure and are flexed in future years based upon historical trends at various revenue levels. Long-term growth was based on terminal value EBITDA multiples to reflect the relevant expected acquisition prices. The discount rate used is intended to reflect the weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant and includes all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows. Decreasing the long-term growth EBITDA multiple or increasing the discount rate would not have changed the results of our impairment testing.\n\nWe experienced decreased net sales in our manufactured products categories primarily due to a continued normalization in multi-family and commodity deflation. Our windows, doors, and millwork sales declined primarily due to price normalization. For the comparable period, specialty building products and services and lumber and lumber sheet goods sales remained relatively consistent.\n\nWe recorded income tax expense of $309.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to income tax expense of $443.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $134.0 million, driven by a decrease in income before income taxes in the current period. Our effective tax rate was 22.3% in 2024 which was relatively flat compared to the 22.4% in 2023.\n\nOur primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs and operating expenses, meet required interest and principal payments, and to fund capital expenditures and potential future growth opportunities. Our capital resources at December 31, 2024, consist of cash on hand and borrowing availability under our Revolving Facility.\n\nInterest Expense, Net",
