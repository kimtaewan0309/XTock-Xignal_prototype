Based on our transmission formula rate and the CIP program for electric and gas distribution, we are also minimally impacted by changes in customers’ usage. Our growth is driven by (i) our investment program to deliver energy more reliably by investing to meet anticipated demand growth and modernizing our electric transmission and electric and gas distribution system and (ii) investing in programs that meet State targets to help deliver cleaner energy, including our EE programs to help customers use less energy and investment programs to build EV infrastructure and solar generation. There may also be opportunities to expand into related clean energy areas, such as renewable natural gas, hydrogen, energy storage, additional solar and renewables, and broader EE investments, though utility participation in these areas is subject to regulatory approval and market design, which continues to evolve. That growth can be affected by customer cost pressures which could result from higher commodity costs, higher supply costs to support subsidized renewable generation, higher operating costs, higher tax rates, macro-economic conditions including inflation, and other factors. Further rate regulated recovery methods, such as net metered generation and/or changes in customer usage behavior could lead to a reduction in billed customer usage to recover our costs, resulting in higher rates overall. Conversely, an increase in EV adoption and other factors could lead to an increase in system usage, require incremental investments to meet higher peak demands and result in a larger customer usage base. There could also be a shift toward greater electrification and less gas usage in the coming decades. While current costs and relative emission savings would limit any substantial change in the near term, technological advances for heat pumps, actions by certain jurisdictions in our service territory and other factors could drive these potential changes, which could result in a slowing in the growth of our gas distribution and an increase in the growth of our electric T&D business. Our CIP reduces the impact on our distribution revenues from changes in sales volumes and demand for most customers. The CIP, which is calculated annually, provides for a true-up of our current period revenue as compared to revenue thresholds established in our most recent\n\nWe and our Nth-party vendors have been and will continue to be subject to cybersecurity attacks, including but not limited to ransomware, denial of service, business email compromises, and malware attacks. To date, there has been no material impact or reasonably likely material impact on our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition from these attacks or other cybersecurity incidents, including as a result of prior cybersecurity incidents. However, we may be unable to prevent all such attacks in the future from having such a material impact as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency. If a significant cybersecurity event or breach occurs within our company or with one of our material vendors, we could be exposed to significant loss of revenue, material repair costs to intellectual and physical property, significant fines and penalties if determined that we were in non-compliance with existing laws and regulations, significant litigation costs, increased costs to finance our businesses, negative publicity, damage to our reputation and loss of confidence from our customers, regulators, investors, vendors and employees. The misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data from us or one of our vendors could lead to significant breach notification expenses, mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring, and legal and regulatory fines and penalties. Moreover, new or updated security laws or regulations\nincluding laws and regulations that respond to evolving application of AI, or unforeseen threat sources could require changes in current measures taken by us and our business operations, which could result in increased costs and adversely affect our financial statements. Similarly, a significant cybersecurity event or breach experienced by a competitor, regulatory authority, RTO, ISO, or vendor could also materially impact our business and results of operations via enhanced legal and regulatory requirements. The amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses that result from cybersecurity incidents may not be sufficient to cover losses or adequately compensate for resulting business disruptions. To address the risks to our information and operational technology systems, we maintain a cybersecurity program that includes policies and controls, cybersecurity insurance, cybersecurity governance and compliance, awareness training, table-top exercises, logging and monitoring, and testing. These preventative actions minimize the likelihood and potential impact of cybersecurity breaches. For a discussion of state and federal cybersecurity regulatory requirements and information regarding our cybersecurity program, see Item 1C. Cybersecurity. Further, we are subject to changing data protection laws in the U.S. and abroad. Legal requirements and regulatory scrutiny for the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continue to evolve and expand, which may present material obligations and risks to our business, including expanded compliance burdens, restrictions on transfer of personal data, costs, and enforcement risks.\n\nPSE&G procures the supply requirements of its default service BGSS gas customers through a full-requirements contract with PSEG Power. The BPU has approved a mechanism designed to recover all gas commodity costs related to BGSS for residential customers. BGSS filings are made annually by June 1 of each year, with a targeted effective date of provisional rates by October 1. PSE&G’s revenues are matched with its costs using deferral accounting, with the goal of achieving a zero cumulative balance by September 30 of each year. In addition, we have the ability to put in place two self-implementing BGSS increases on December 1 and February 1 of up to 5% and also may reduce the BGSS rate at any time and/or provide bill credits. Any difference between rates charged under the BGSS contract and rates charged to our residential customers is deferred and collected or refunded through adjustments in future rates. C&I customers that do not select third-party suppliers are also supplied under the BGSS arrangement. These customers are charged a market-based price largely determined by prices for commodity futures contracts.\n\nCybersecurity threats to the energy market infrastructure are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency, particularly with the regularity of virtual operations. Because of the inherent vulnerability of infrastructure and technology and operational systems to disability or failure due to hacking, viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing and other social engineering attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware, acts of war or terrorism, or other cybersecurity incidents, we face increased risk of cyberattack. We rely on information and operational technology systems and network infrastructure to operate our generation and T&D systems. We also store sensitive data, intellectual property and proprietary or personally identifiable information regarding our business, infrastructure, employees, shareholders, customers and vendors on our IT systems and conduct power marketing and hedging activities. In addition, the operation of our business is dependent upon the IT systems of Nth parties (i.e., our third parties and other business relationships, including fourth parties, etc.), including our\n\nThe success of our businesses is dependent on our ability to continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers while minimizing service disruptions. We are exposed to the risk of asset and equipment failures, gas explosions, accidents, natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of war or terrorism or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations, sabotage, physical attacks or security breaches, cyberattacks or other incidents, which could result in damage to or destruction of our substations or other facilities or infrastructure, or damage to persons or property and to electric and gas supply interruptions. Further, a major failure of availability or performance of a critical operating technology or business system, and inadequate preparation or execution of business continuity or disaster recovery plans for the loss of one or several critical systems, could result in extended disruption to operations or business processes, damage to systems and/or loss of data\nWe have historically benefited from access to mutual aid, a voluntary and reciprocal arrangement with other utilities that provides access to a trained and flexible labor force which has helped to reduce outage restoration times during extreme weather events. There is no guarantee that we will have continued access to mutual aid as the frequency of severe weather events rises.\n\nAI, including Generative AI and Post-Quantum Cryptography, has the potential to change the way we operate by creating efficiencies and improving processes and customer experiences. The development, adoption, and use for generative AI technologies are still in their early stages and ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by PSEG or Nth-party vendors could result in unintended consequences. We contract third-party vendors that use AI in products and/or services they provide and we may not have full control or visibility over the quality, performance, security or compliance of the products and services that incorporate AI-related technology. AI algorithms that we or our Nth-party vendors use may be flawed or may be based on data sets that are biased or insufficient. These limitations or failures could result in reputational damage, unauthorized disclosure of data, and legal liabilities. Developing, testing, and deploying resource-intensive AI systems may require additional investment and increase our costs. In addition, the evolving nature of AI may cause new laws and regulations to be enacted which may require significant resources to modify and maintain business practices to comply with the new laws and regulations, the nature of which cannot be determined at this time. Further, inaccurate results generated as a result of our employees’, contractors’ or vendors’ use of generative AI technologies could lead to operational interruptions or reputational harm.\n\nPSE&G is subject to regulation by the BPU. Such regulation affects almost every aspect of its businesses, including its retail rates. Failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse impact on PSE&G’s ability to operate its business and could result in fines, penalties or sanctions. The retail rates for electric and gas distribution services are established in a distribution base rate proceeding and remain in effect until a new distribution base rate proceeding is filed and concluded. PSE&G's base rates were most recently approved in October 2024. In addition, our utility has received approval for several clause recovery mechanisms, some of which provide for recovery of costs and earn returns on authorized investments. These clause mechanisms require periodic financial reviews to update rates charged to customers which are independent of base rate proceedings and are subject to prudency reviews by the BPU. Inability to obtain fair or timely recovery of all our costs pursuant to the distribution base rate case and/or these c",
